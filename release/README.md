This directory is the home of pull-requests.json, comments.json, and project-status.json. Since pull-requests.json and comments.json exceeds GitHub's file limits, these files must be either downloaded or generated.

To download them:

```sh
./download-release.sh
```

To build them localy:

```sh
./build-release.sh
```
