Also, the v2 behavior should already be SQL compliant because Calcite will make sure that the return type for the division operator is appropriate (and Pinot makes sure to cast internal values based on the expected return type of an operator).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2377446516/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2377466606","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/14067#issuecomment-2377466606","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/14067","id":2377466606,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c6NtULu","user":{"login":"klsince","id":61892277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxODkyMjc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61892277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/klsince","html_url":"https://github.com/klsince","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klsince/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klsince/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klsince/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klsince/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klsince/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klsince/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klsince/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klsince/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klsince/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-26T16:50:46Z","updated_at":"2024-09-26T16:50:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@dang-stripe yup, that should be the expected behavior today.

Also, an expression like `5 / 3 + 1.5` will return `3.166666666666667` in the v2 engine (since the cast is not done after each function call), as opposed to `2.5` in Postgres.\r\n\r\n> Currently, when adding 2 ints, will v2 engine return int\r\n\r\nYes, it does, which seems somewhat problematic because something like `2000000000 + 2000000000` results in an integer overflow occurring and a negative integer value being returned.\r\n\r\n> I was thinking adding a general query option to turn v1 engine into standard sql compatible mode, so that v2 engine can enable it and get standard sql behavior\r\n\r\n> Basically we want a general way so that we can add standard SQL support without breaking existing v1 queries\r\n\r\nI wasn't able to find any common standard SQL definition for such arithmetic operations. For instance, in MySQL `1 / 2` returns `0.5` and `2000000000 + 2000000000` returns `4000000000` (similar to the Pinot v1 engine, unlike Postgres or Pinot v2 engine). Other databases seem to be doing this their own way as well. If there's a consensus that we always want to do things the Postgres way going forward, then the query option should be something like `usePostgresSemantics`? And coming to this PR itself, I presume we'd want the improvements here with or without such a query option right? And only put some of the compatibility breaking changes (like enforcing `int` for arithmetic operations on `int` and the type specific division) behind the new query option?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2378874424/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2379020331","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/14090#issuecomment-2379020331","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/14090","id":2379020331,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c6NzPgr","user":{"login":"dependabot[bot]","id":49699333,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDk2OTkzMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/29110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/dependabot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-27T11:04:19Z","updated_at":"2024-09-27T11:04:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Superseded

The [dictionary based predicate evaluator](https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/4709954097703f88dbd419ab0436a4c1356e9c85/pinot-core/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/core/operator/filter/predicate/PredicateEvaluatorProvider.java#L64-L65) created for the `BETWEEN` filter predicate is reduced to an always false predicate here - https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/4709954097703f88dbd419ab0436a4c1356e9c85/pinot-core/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/core/operator/filter/predicate/RangePredicateEvaluatorFactory.java#L163-L165 because `N8315C` is > `N130DL`.\r\n\r\nHowever, when the `BETWEEN` filter predicate is re-written to `DivTailNums >= 'N8315C' AND DivTailNums <= 'N130DL'`, there are actually matches found since it is an MV column with multiple values (and the nature of filter predicates on MV columns is such that true is returned if any single value matches). Unfortunately, since the query rewrite is being done in the `CalciteSqlParser` which doesn't have access to the schema, there is no way to skip this rewrite for MV columns. There's also no straightforward way to remove such filters altogether due to the various type combinations we'd need to handle in order to check if such a filter is \"always false\" (and the fact that we don't know the column type at that point in order to be able to do appropriate conversions).\r\n\r\nWe could do this in the filter optimizer phase instead, which does have access to the schema, but then if we also want to support `col1 BETWEEN col2 AND 100` like use cases we'll need to duplicate the identifier / literal re-ordering logic across the query rewriter and query optimizer.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2379383099/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2379394947","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/14099#issuecomment-2379394947","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/14099","id":2379394947,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c6N0q-D","user":{"login":"abhioncbr","id":1076944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzY5NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1076944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhioncbr","html_url":"https://github.com/abhioncbr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhioncbr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhioncbr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhioncbr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhioncbr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhioncbr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhioncbr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhioncbr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhioncbr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhioncbr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-27T14:19:03Z","updated_at":"2024-09-27T14:19:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Got it.

This happens in the `SqlToRelConverter` phase of the query compilation (i.e., even before any optimization rules are applied by the `HepPlanner`). There's a conversion rule defined in the `StandardConvertletTable` that does the conversion - https://github.com/apache/calcite/blob/a8802c721a2805159d166e45044c00364d1cb6c3/core/src/main/java/org/apache/calcite/sql2rel/StandardConvertletTable.java#L1321-L1368.\r\n\r\n> Will the change in https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/13618 prevent this rewrite?\r\n\r\nNo, it doesn't unfortunately, so this is another bug / issue. `select count(*) from airlineStats where arraytomv(RandomAirports) BETWEEN 'PSC' AND 'ATL'` from the default quickstart returns 0 on the single-stage query engine and 4478 on the multi-stage query engine due to the rewrite:\r\n\r\n```\r\nExecution Plan\r\nPinotLogicalAggregate(group=[{}], agg#0=[COUNT($0)])\r\n  PinotLogicalExchange(distribution=[hash])\r\n    PinotLogicalAggregate(group=[{}], agg#0=[COUNT()])\r\n      LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(>=(ARRAY_TO_MV($71), _UTF-8'PSC'), <=(ARRAY_TO_MV($71), _UTF-8'ATL'))])\r\n        LogicalTableScan(table=[[default, airlineStats]])\r\n```\r\n\r\nEdit: It's pretty straightforward to disable the conversion in the multistage query engine by adding an override to the [PinotConvertletTable](https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/ad1eda52ea3e9a040f87d0e0cabff1fba933f7bf/pinot-query-planner/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/calcite/sql2rel/PinotConvertletTable.java#L37) but that will lead to a regression since queries with filter predicates like `WHERE col1 BETWEEN col2 AND col3` that currently only work with the multistage query engine will no longer work without the rewrite. Since MV column support in general is pretty shaky in the multistage engine, I think it's probably better to live with that default Calcite rewrite behavior there for now.\r\n\r\nFor the v1 query engine, I've tried to move the rewrite from the query rewriter phase to the optimizer phase since we have access to the schema there and can skip the rewrite for MV columns; similar to this other filter predicate optimizer which should also ideally have been in the query rewriter phase - https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/ad1eda52ea3e9a040f87d0e0cabff1fba933f7bf/pinot-core/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/core/query/optimizer/statement/StringPredicateFilterOptimizer.java#L35-L46\r\n\r\nUnfortunately though, this does mean that we still won't be able to support queries with filter predicates like `WHERE col1 BETWEEN col2 AND col3` in the v1 query engine.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/14111","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2380395488/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2380603055","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/13982#issuecomment-2380603055","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/13982","id":2380603055,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c6N5R6v","user":{"login":"protyay","id":8929811,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5Mjk4MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8929811?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/protyay","html_url":"https://github.com/protyay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/protyay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/protyay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/protyay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/protyay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/protyay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/protyay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/protyay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/protyay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/protyay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-28T11:01:11Z","updated_at":"2024-09-28T11:01:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks.
