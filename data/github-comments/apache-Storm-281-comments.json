href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=srdo\">srdo</a>:</i>\n<p>I thought a bit more about this.</p>\n\n<p>Here are the situations I could think of where tuples are currently being expired without being lost:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>The tuple tree is still making progress, and tuples are getting acked, but the time to process the entire tree is larger than the tuple timeout. This is very likely to happen if there's congestion somewhere in the topology.</li>\n\t<li>The tuple tree is not making progress, because a bolt is currently processing a tuple in the tree, and processing is taking longer than expected.</li>\n\t<li>The tuple tree is not making progress, because the tuple(s) are stuck in queues behind other slow tuples. This is also very likely to happen if there's congestion in the topology.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>The situation where there's still progress being made can be solved by resetting the tuple timeout whenever an ack is received. In order to reduce load on the spout, we should try to \"bundle up\" these resets in the acker bolts before sending them to the spout. I think a decent way to do this bundling is to make the acker bolt keep track of which tuples they've received acks from since the last time timeouts were reset. When a configured interval expires, the bolt empties out the list of live tuples, and sends timeout resets for all of them to the spout. The interval should probably be specified as a percentage of the tuple timeout.</p>\n\n<p>If a bolt is taking longer to process a tuple than expected, it can be solved in the concrete bolt implementation by using OutputCollector.resetTimeout at an appropriate interval (e.g. the tuple timeout minus a few seconds).</p>\n\n<p>When tuples are stuck in queues behind other tuples, the topology can have a hard time recovering. This is because the expiration timer starts ticking for a tuple as soon as it's emitted, so if the bolt queues are congested, the bolts may be spending all their time processing tuples that belong to expired tuple trees. In order to solve this, we need to reset timeouts for queued tuples from time to time. It should be possible to add a thread that peeks at the available messages in the DisruptorQueue with some interval, and resets the timeout for any messages that were also queued last time the thread was run. Only sending the resets once a tuple has been queued for the entire interval should help decrease the number of unnecessary resets sent to the spout. We should be able to reuse the interval configuration also added to the acker bolt. </p>\n\n<p>I'd welcome any feedback on these ideas <img class=\"emoticon\" src=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/smile.png\" height=\"16\" width=\"16\" align=\"absmiddle\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"/></p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612985515/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/304538548","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2100#issuecomment-304538548","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2100","id":304538548,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNDUzODU0OA==","user":{"login":"jerrypeng","id":3613359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTMzNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3613359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng","html_url":"https://github.com/jerrypeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-28T20:35:49Z","updated_at":"2017-05-28T20:35:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@adityasharad is I agree with your change for the sortComponents on line 544.

That will help minimize upgrade pains since people can make the changes when upgrading to 1.1.x, and not have to make this particular change when upgrading to 2.x (for example).  i.e., having both the violating method name as well as the new adhering method name be available.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/305308135/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/305320221","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2117#issuecomment-305320221","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2117","id":305320221,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNTMyMDIyMQ==","user":{"login":"srdo","id":4324588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjQ1ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4324588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo","html_url":"https://github.com/srdo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-31T21:17:10Z","updated_at":"2017-05-31T21:17:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@erikdw Sorry, didn't get much response on the mailing list thread, so expected that people just didn't care.

Whereas coding style adherence is not a very convincing reason.\r\n\r\nMaybe someone with a view on the number & scale of breaking changes in Storm 2.0 as compared to 1.0 could speak up?  I'm fairly ignorant about the \"gestalt\" of what is happening in Storm 2.0 and so don't know the answer to that question.  i.e., if everyone is going to have to make a bunch of changes *anyways* then it's probably \"no big deal\" to slap in this method name casing change.

I can't speak for most of the Storm components, but I believe at least storm-kafka-client has a fair number of breaking API changes between 1.x and 2.x.

Looking at some topology code I have lying around, there's a decent number of compile errors after switching to 2.0.0-SNAPSHOT from 1.1.0\r\n\r\nI think if we're going to rename methods it would be good to get them all out of the way in a single release. That way it isn't going to become a regular nuisance. We could make sure to get them all fixed now for version 2.0.0, and then put deprecations for all of them in 1.x?\r\n\r\nI agree that this isn't that important of a change, but my impression is that people are probably going to need to change their code anyway when migrating to 2.x, so I don't know that it adds that much of an additional cost.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/306295792/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/306302992","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2117#issuecomment-306302992","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2117","id":306302992,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNjMwMjk5Mg==","user":{"login":"erikdw","id":1111441,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE0NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111441?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikdw","html_url":"https://github.com/erikdw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikdw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikdw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikdw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikdw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikdw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikdw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikdw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikdw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikdw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-05T20:48:07Z","updated_at":"2017-06-05T20:48:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@srdo : thanks for your perspective on this.

I missed some cases.</p>\n\n<p>Just to illustrate:<br/>\nSay maxUncommittedOffsets is 10, maxPollRecords is 5, and the committedOffset is 0.<br/>\nThe spout will initially emit up to offset 10, because it is allowed to poll until numNonRetriableTuples is >= maxUncommittedOffsets<br/>\nThe spout will be allowed to emit another 5 tuples if offset 10 fails, so if that happens, offsets 10-14 will get emitted. If offset 1 fails and 2-14 get acked, the spout gets stuck because it will count the \"extra tuples\" 11-14 in numNonRetriableTuples.</p>\n\n<p>An similar case is the one where maxPollRecords doesn't divide maxUncommittedOffsets evenly. If it were 3 in the example above, the spout might just immediately emit offsets 1-12. If 2-12 get acked, offset 1 cannot be reemitted.</p>\n\n<p>Your suggestion would solve this, but also means that we can't meaningfully cap numUncommittedOffsets. If we allow a poll whenever there's a failed tuple, the spout might emit an arbitrary number of tuples if tuples fail in an unlucky order.</p>\n\n<p>For example, take the case where maxUncommittedOffsets is 10, maxPollRecords is 5, and the committedOffset is 0, and 10 tuples have been emitted.<br/>\nIf offset 10 fails and is retried, 10-14 may be emitted. If 14 fails, 14-19 get emitted. This can be repeated as many times as needed. The issue is more likely to happen when multiple partitions are involved, because then you might have a failed tuple on partition 0 cause the spout to emit fresh tuples on partition 1, regardless of how far past the limit partition 1 already is.</p>\n\n<p>I'm torn on whether this kind of limit violation is really serious enough to matter. It's possible that we run a lot past maxUncommittedOffsets, but it doesn't seem likely that the bad tuple failure pattern keeps repeating. It's just a gut feeling though, which is why I made an attempt to put a real cap on maxUncommittedOffsets in the linked PRs.</p>\n\n<p>If it is serious enough that we want to fix it I think there are two decent approaches. </p>\n\n<p>One is to do what you mention and filter out the fresh tuples we happen to also receive when we poll for failed tuples. The downside is that in order to avoid losing tuples, we have to seek the consumer back to the first tuple we filtered out for each partition, or we have to be able to emit only the retriable tuples while keeping the rest in memory for later. </p>\n\n<p>The other option would be to always allow retries (per partition) only for those tuples that are within maxUncommittedOffsets tuples of committedOffsets. For example, if the maxUncommittedOffsets is 10, maxPollRecords is 5, and the committedOffset is 0, and 14 tuples have been emitted, we only allow retries for the partition if the earliest retriable tuple is one of the first 10. The point would be that we never fail to retry tuples within maxUncommittedOffsets of the committed offset, but we don't retry tuples that are beyond that boundary until the committed offset moves, so we can cap numUncommittedOffsets. The downsides to this are we have to do this evaluation per partition, and we might have to pause nonretriable partitions when we're beyond maxUncommittedOffsets to ensure that we actually emit the retriable tuples and not just some new ones on unrelated partitions.</p>\n\n<p>I don't really have a particular preference here. What do you think?</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612983650/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612983657","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/6125#issuecomment-2612983657","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/6125","id":2612983657,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI5ODM2NTc=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-07T20:24:17Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T16:56:49Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=ranganp\">ranganp</a>:</i>\n<p><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=Srdo\" class=\"user-hover\" rel=\"srdo\">Stig Rohde Døssing</a> I need some time to properly digest your input and reply.

This happens because we check for numUncommittedOffsets in poll() but once it succeeds and a kafka broker call is made, we go ahead and emit ALL the tuples received from the broker. This effectively means that there can be an undefined number of tuples over and beyond the maxUncommittedOffsets being processed by the topology.</p>\n\n<p>Now, if we capped the total number of tuples under process (including those ready or waiting for retry) then the logic we have for poll() would always ensure that failed tuples are fetched from the brokers. Does this make sense? Or am I missing any edge case here?</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612983657/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612983664","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/6125#issuecomment-2612983664","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/6125","id":2612983664,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI5ODM2NjQ=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-07T20:32:21Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T16:56:49Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=ranganp\">ranganp</a>:</i>\n<p><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=Srdo\" class=\"user-hover\" rel=\"srdo\">Stig Rohde Døssing</a> Need a basic clarification on the following: Offsets are TopicPartition specific but numUncommittedOffsets is global across all the partitions that belong to the spout instance / executor in question, right?</p>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612983664/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612983668","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/6125#issuecomment-2612983668","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/6125","id":2612983668,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI5ODM2Njg=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-07T20:40:24Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T16:56:49Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=srdo\">srdo</a>:</i>\n<p>That isn't quite true.

I don't think we're treating maxUncommittedOffsets as a strict cap (because it is hard to enforce if we want to emit all the tuples we receive in poll), but we'd like to at least be able to say we won't go farther than x tuples past it.</p>\n\n<p>I think you're missing the case where the poll returns messages from an unexpected partition. e.g. if you have retriable tuples on partition 1 and are at the cap of how many tuples you're willing to process, you would want to allow poll so you can retry the tuples. Unless you pause the partitions that don't have retriable tuples, the consumer might decide to poll from those instead.

The current implementation has a pending map in both the acker and the spout, which rotate every topology.message.timeout.secs. If the acker doesn't forward reset requests to the spout, the spout will just expire the tuple tree on its own when the message timeout has passed.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>That case would be more accurately classified as \"progress is being made\" ... but slower than expected.<br/>\nThe case of 'progress is not being made' is when a worker that is processing part of the tuple tree dies.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Yes, you are right. But it is currently possible that the topology may degrade to no progress being made even if each individual tuple could be processed under the message timeout, because tuples can expire while queued and get reemitted, where they can then be delayed by their own duplicates which are ahead in the queue. For IRichBolts, this can be mitigated by the bolt being written to accept and queue tuples internally, where the bolt can then reset their timeouts manually if necessary, but for IBasicBolt this is not possible.</p>\n\n<p>Just to give a concrete example, we had an IBasicBolt enrich tuples with some database data. Most tuples were processed very quickly, but a few were slow. Even the slow tuples never took longer than our message timeout individually. We then had an instance where a bunch of slow tuples happened to come in on the stream close to each other. The first few were processed before they expired, but the rest expired while queued. The spout then reemitted the expired tuples, and they got into the queue behind their own expired instances. Since the bolt won't skip expired tuples, the freshly emitted tuples also expired, which caused another reemit. This repeated until the topology was restarted so the queues could be cleared.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612985531/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
