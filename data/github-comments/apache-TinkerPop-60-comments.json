The current client tests are overriding an internal object and they did not play nice with having that block of code extracted out. I need more time to figure out why that is. We can either hold off on this PR and fixed that up or we can merge this PR in and I can create a JIRA ticket to figure out a better way to remove the duplicated block of

A general question I have is around how the serializers (particularily graphbinary) will recognize the new tokens added in this reviews.\r\n\r\n1. We decided to skip process suite tests in favor of just feature tests. Especially since these tests are only testable via Tinkergraph. That's why I put them directly in the Tinkergraph package.\r\n2. All the ServiceRegistry stuff is part of the Graph API, not part of Gremlin or the remoting API.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1065158622/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1067369660","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1584#issuecomment-1067369660","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1584","id":1067369660,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc4_nsS8","user":{"login":"olivertowers","id":24803650,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODAzNjUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24803650?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/olivertowers","html_url":"https://github.com/olivertowers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olivertowers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olivertowers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olivertowers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olivertowers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olivertowers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olivertowers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olivertowers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olivertowers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olivertowers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-14T22:36:07Z","updated_at":"2022-03-14T22:36:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@FlorianHockmann - are you able to approve running the workflows for this PR?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1067369660/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1069033565","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1585#issuecomment-1069033565","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1585","id":1069033565,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc4_uChd","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-16T11:39:23Z","updated_at":"2022-03-16T11:39:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This change also includes some adjustments to the grammar to allow for `Map` definition to be a bit more Groovy-like.

However, we can't confidently say that the client is production ready unless we have tested it on various scenarios involving client-server interaction.\r\n\r\n> The only driver that has any tests like this is Java and that is because the test setup is such that we can easily start/stop/reconfigure Gremlin Server. There is no such mechanism to do so for non-JVM language variants. \r\n\r\nI understand what we did not have integration tests for other non-java drivers in the past. But we don't have to keep following the same practices from the past if they were incorrect. Given the scope of usage TinkerPop clients has across the industry, I would argue that we need to release well tested and stable software if we are making something GA.\r\n\r\nWe can still merge this PR into mainline without integration tests and call it Beta (not recommended for production usage) until we have sufficient testing in place. But I don't agree with calling this ready for production use (GA / preview-GA).\r\n\r\nNow, as far as how to do the technical implementation goes, we can either do it against the TinkerPop server or a mock WebSocket server. The ultimate aim is to assert the client-server contract, e.g. does the client respect a close WebSocket frame from the server correctly.\r\n\r\n**Option A: With live server**\r\n\r\n1. Write an API in the server available in debug mode which will trigger the specific test behaviour we want, e.g. close the WS connection with a WS frame.\r\n\r\n2. Use a shell script to start the server and then run a go file containing the integration test. The integration test assumes that a server is running on port 8182\r\n\r\n3. Invoke the \"test\" API from point 1 to make the server do the desired behaviour. \r\n\r\n**Option B: With mock WS server** (All the scenarios that I wrote in the PR comment can be handled by a mock WS server)\r\n\r\nGorilla WebSocket library (the same one that client uses in this PR) already has example tests on how to mock a server. See: https://github.com/gorilla/websocket/blob/master/client_server_test.go#L62 \r\n\r\nwe can mock a server with WebSocket connection similarly and make it send a close websocket to see how the client reacts and assert the reaction. Similarly for other test scenarios I mentioned, we can mock the connection \"disconnect\" and can mock the \"WS handshake timeout\" using the mocks.
