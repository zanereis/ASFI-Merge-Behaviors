Sandeep for fixing the range-related bug in this PR. The fix itself looks good to me. For consistency, I would recommend keeping the logic of `RangeTest`  similar to  https://github.com/apache/incubator-systemml/blob/master/src/test/java/org/apache/sysml/test/integration/functions/data/SequenceTest.java and parameterizing Range1.pydml and Range2.pydml (similar to Sequence.dml and Sequence2inputs.dml), i.e.:\n\n``` bash\n# license ...\nA = range($1, $2, $3);\nsave(A, $4);\n```\n\nThe code of RangeTest would then be similar to SequenceTest except following changes to :\n1. Test-case naming: https://github.com/apache/incubator-systemml/blob/master/src/test/java/org/apache/sysml/test/integration/functions/data/SequenceTest.java#L47\n2. Invoking the .pydml https://github.com/apache/incubator-systemml/blob/master/src/test/java/org/apache/sysml/test/integration/functions/data/SequenceTest.java#L108\n\nThis way, you check with R for sanity testing rather than constant data. Also, other developers are free to try testing range with different parameters: https://github.com/apache/incubator-systemml/blob/master/src/test/java/org/apache/sysml/test/integration/functions/data/SequenceTest.java#L69 \n\nAlternatively, you can extend `SequenceTest` itself by adding an additional parameter isPyDML at https://github.com/apache/incubator-systemml/blob/master/src/test/java/org/apache/sysml/test/integration/functions/data/SequenceTest.java#L69 and to the constructor https://github.com/apache/incubator-systemml/blob/master/src/test/java/org/apache/sysml/test/integration/functions/data/SequenceTest.java#L57. Then depending of whether isPyDML is true or not, you can chose appropriate file to execute, i.e. https://github.com/apache/incubator-systemml/blob/master/src/test/java/org/apache/sysml/test/integration/functions/data/SequenceTest.java#L108.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/249317519/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/249329466","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/256#issuecomment-249329466","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/256","id":249329466,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0OTMyOTQ2Ng==","user":{"login":"niketanpansare","id":11686380,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjg2Mzgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11686380?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare","html_url":"https://github.com/niketanpansare","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-24T00:07:01Z","updated_at":"2016-09-24T00:07:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"For other committers, I have sanity tested this PR with following code and it works as expected:\n\n``` bash\nX = range(5, 2) # range(5, 2, -2), range(1, 5), ... works as expected\n# Also, range(5,1,1) throws LanguageException\nstr = toString(X)\nprint(str)\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/249329466/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/249337528","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/259#issuecomment-249337528","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/259","id":249337528,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0OTMzNzUyOA==","user":{"login":"mboehm7","id":13721609,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzIxNjA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13721609?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7","html_url":"https://github.com/mboehm7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-24T01:43:29Z","updated_at":"2016-09-24T01:43:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"that's a great catch.
