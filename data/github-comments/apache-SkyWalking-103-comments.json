(`com.caucho.hessian.server.HessianServlet#invoke`), and it seems that you have already instrumented `HessianSkeleton`, so perhaps you can instrument `HessianSkeleton` and use SkyWalking dynamic field (or something similar) to keep the url (if any) in one request through the instrumented classes.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, I think class `HessianSkeleton` is the core of hessian, which should be used by any other frameworks that integrate with hessian, such as Spring, and instrumenting it should work with/wihout third-party frameworks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/514050365/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/514071471","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/3148#issuecomment-514071471","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/3148","id":514071471,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNDA3MTQ3MQ==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-23T06:24:54Z","updated_at":"2019-07-23T06:24:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"You

Also, plugin interceptor point definitions have been as public, as `BootstrapInstrumentBoost` needs to access it.\r\n\r\nAlso, I add a demo `jre-HttpUrlConnection` plugin for demo, and instrumen the following application codes.\r\n```java\r\nimport java.io.BufferedReader;\r\nimport java.io.IOException;\r\nimport java.io.InputStreamReader;\r\nimport java.net.HttpURLConnection;\r\nimport java.net.URL;\r\n\r\npublic class Main {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\r\n        URL obj = new URL(\"http://www.baidu.com\");\r\n        HttpURLConnection con = (HttpURLConnection)obj.openConnection();\r\n\r\n        con.setRequestMethod(\"GET\");\r\n\r\n        int responseCode = con.getResponseCode();\r\n        System.out.println(\"Response Code : \" + responseCode);\r\n\r\n        BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(\r\n            new InputStreamReader(con.getInputStream()));\r\n        String inputLine;\r\n        StringBuffer response = new StringBuffer();\r\n\r\n        while ((inputLine = in.readLine()) != null) {\r\n            response.append(inputLine);\r\n        }\r\n        in.close();\r\n\r\n        //print result\r\n        System.out.println(response.toString());\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nLike the existing plugins, the bootstrap intrumentation only requires you to declare it in plugin define, such as following codes I included in this PR\r\n```java\r\n/**\r\n * @author wusheng\r\n */\r\npublic class HttpUrlConnectionInstrumentation extends ClassEnhancePluginDefine {\r\n    private static String CLASS_NAME = \"java.net.HttpURLConnection\";\r\n\r\n     // This is the only change for plugin developer\r\n    @Override public boolean isBootstrapInstrumentation() {\r\n        return true;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override protected ClassMatch enhanceClass() {\r\n        return byName(CLASS_NAME);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override public InstanceMethodsInterceptPoint[] getInstanceMethodsInterceptPoints() {\r\n        return new InstanceMethodsInterceptPoint[] {\r\n            new InstanceMethodsInterceptPoint() {\r\n                @Override public ElementMatcher<MethodDescription> getMethodsMatcher() {\r\n                    return named(\"setRequestMethod\");\r\n                }\r\n\r\n                @Override public String getMethodsInterceptor() {\r\n                    return \"org.apache.skywalking.apm.plugin.jre.httpurlconnection.Interceptor\";\r\n                }\r\n\r\n                @Override public boolean isOverrideArgs() {\r\n                    return false;\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        };\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, I haven't finished construct and static method plugin, but they are very similar, as we have this, they are simple. I will push those later.\r\n\r\nI hope you could test this new mechanism in other demo codes, Spring Boot and Tomcat especially, in case I miss anything.\r\n\r\n@ascrutae Please lead the tests.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/514252426/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/514257682","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/2932#issuecomment-514257682","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/2932","id":514257682,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNDI1NzY4Mg==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-23T15:21:01Z","updated_at":"2019-07-23T15:21:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@candyleer New codebase is there.

`HessianSkeleton` (`com.caucho.hessian.server.HessianServlet#invoke`), and it seems that you have already instrumented `HessianSkeleton`, so perhaps you can instrument `HessianSkeleton` and use SkyWalking dynamic field (or something similar) to keep the url (if any) in one request through the instrumented classes.\r\n> \r\n> To summarize, I think class `HessianSkeleton` is the core of hessian, which should be used by any other frameworks that integrate with hessian, such as Spring, and instrumenting it should work with/wihout third-party frameworks\r\n\r\nYes, you are right.
