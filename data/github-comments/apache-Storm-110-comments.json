Sorry about the confusion.  I have been playing around with batching and I was not referring to your code changes.  Disruptor offers two different ways of batching.  One is on the read side, which this patch is about.  That did not work in improving the efficiency/throughput of the queue.  Instead the batching has to happen on the enqueue side to reduce the load it is placing on the OS in signaling/waking up the worker thread.\n\nI have some micro benchmarks that show this, and how much of a performance improvement we can potentially expect to see.  I have been able to do over 2,000,000 word count sentences per second on my Mac Book Pro laptop, where as storm is much lower.  I have not finished collecting numbers, and I am working on some code to do this in storm itself so we can see the impact it can have.\n\nThe main reason why I like this approach over batching at the spout is that the code is isolated to just the queue itself, and should not have an impact of the rest of storm, except potentially to remove some of the other code changes that were put into storm initially to try and improve the throughput.\n\nBut I really want to have a working prototype with performance numbers before I try to compare the two approaches.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/142036022/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612581825","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4792#issuecomment-2612581825","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4792","id":2612581825,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI1ODE4MjU=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-21T17:41:06Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T13:52:30Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a

newer version of disruptor</p>\n\n<p>    This upgrades to version 3.3.2 of the Disruptor Queue.  There have been questions about stability in the past, and also out of order delivery.</p>\n\n<p>    I really wanted to be sure that everything would be about the same.  I ran the DisruptorQueue related unit tests over the weekend and got no failures at all, with well over 10,000 runs.</p>\n\n<p>    I did some performance tests too using the FastWordCountTopology I added as a part of this.  I ran 5 times with the original 0.11.0-SNAPSHOT this is based off of (e85921035fa9bb59d25f0347dc6d26002aac9fab) and with this branch.  By setting the topology.max.spout.pending to 200 I got essentially identical results.  The new Queue was slightly faster but it was small enough it could just be noise.</p>\n\n<p>    Similarly when I did not set topology.max.spout.pending and relied on the automatic throttling I got very similar numbers, although the variance between the runs was much higher so having a real comparison there is much more difficult.</p>\n\n<p>    @HeartSaVioR in the past you did some testing to see if out of order delivery was happening, I would love it if you could take a look at this patch and test it similarly.</p>\n\n<p>    Anecdotally I have seen this version behave better than the current one we are using.  I have seen no NPEs from tuples disappearing and I have seen that show up in some of my stress testing using the old queue.  Again I don't know how often this happens so I cannot guarantee that it was a disruptor bug.</p>\n\n<p>You can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:</p>\n\n<p>    $ git pull <a href=\"https://github.com/revans2/incubator-storm\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/revans2/incubator-storm</a> disruptor-upgrade</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/750.patch\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/750.patch</a></p>\n\n<p>To close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch<br/>\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:</p>\n\n<p>    This closes #750</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>commit 46df80cfc63f01c3a5587a879ce0d721fad3f07f<br/>\nAuthor: Robert (Bobby) Evans <evans@yahoo-inc.com><br/>\nDate:   2015-09-18T21:33:39Z</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-350\" title=\"Update disruptor to latest version (3.3.2)\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-350\"><del>STORM-350</del></a>: Upgrade to newer version of disruptor</p>\n\n<hr />","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612470434/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/142097964","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/750#issuecomment-142097964","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/750","id":142097964,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MjA5Nzk2NA==","user":{"login":"revans2","id":3441321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDEzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3441321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2","html_url":"https://github.com/revans2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-21T20:21:31Z","updated_at":"2015-09-21T20:21:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The travis failure looks unrelated.

This is the same null issue we were seeing previously.  Just with the newer disruptor it exacerbates the two issues.\n\nFirst MutableObject is not synchronized so it is possible for the data to not be flushed to memory and if the receiver thread is on a different core you can get a null out.\n\nAdditionally I noticed that the non-bocking receive seems to not be putting the correct barriers in place, and the polling can try to read a MutableObject that has not been updated yet, and is still set to null.  The only way I could find to fix it was to implement it in terms of the blocking call.
