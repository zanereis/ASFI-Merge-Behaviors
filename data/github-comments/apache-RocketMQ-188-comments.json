Another solustion is not to sleep 100ms after each iteration.\r\nAs for the behavior, the default ConsumeQueue only iters one file, the RocksDBConsumeQueue only iters at most 16 items. so I think the behavior is not defined about how many items the iteration returns. and will not impact upper layer

看以上2图,能看出点端倪来\r\n\r\n这个图有点疑问，就是client需要先获取所有topic路由，用了proxy和broker 同一个进程的话，获取到的路由地址会被proxy替换成proxy的端口，然后根据对应topic所在的proxy，客户端会选择对应的proxy地址去send message。但是现状看起来是客户端获取topic路由的时候，由于topic不在当前broker上，导致路由信息返回的message type 为 0，客户端获取不到topic路由。\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0f73832-eb86-40c9-8e03-cb17469e7426)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/2467074172/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/2467145811","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/8904#issuecomment-2467145811","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/8904","id":2467145811,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl86TDahT","user":{"login":"dyrnq","id":68039577,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MDM5NTc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68039577?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyrnq","html_url":"https://github.com/dyrnq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyrnq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyrnq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyrnq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyrnq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyrnq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyrnq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyrnq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyrnq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyrnq/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-11T03:10:37Z","updated_at":"2024-11-11T03:10:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"确实如此了，那得要求client自行判断了","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/2467145811/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/2467153290","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/8904#issuecomment-2467153290","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/8904","id":2467153290,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl86TDcWK","user":{"login":"VictoryAnn","id":39869799,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODY5Nzk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39869799?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictoryAnn","html_url":"https://github.com/VictoryAnn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictoryAnn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictoryAnn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictoryAnn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictoryAnn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictoryAnn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictoryAnn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictoryAnn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictoryAnn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictoryAnn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-11T03:19:54Z","updated_at":"2024-11-11T03:19:54Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"那现在的问题就是，客户端从proxy获取路由报错，Message
