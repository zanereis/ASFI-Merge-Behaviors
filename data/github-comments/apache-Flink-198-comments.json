It would add a test dependency to a consumer code (bug in consumer would/could brake producer tests making the error messages very confusing). Furthermore using second Flink job would be definitely more heavy and more time/resources consuming - this second job would need to execute exactly same code as those methods, but wrapped into additional layer (Flink application). Lastly this wrapping would add additional complexity that could make this tests more prone for intermittent failures and timeouts. \r\n\r\nIf you have the data written somewhere, why don't you want to read them directly? One more bonus reason for doing it as it is, it makes possible to test producers without spawning any Flink job altogether in some mini IT cases (which I'm doing in tests for `Kafka011`, I test `FlinkKafkaProducer` directly).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/316295876/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/316296694","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4310#issuecomment-316296694","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4310","id":316296694,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNjI5NjY5NA==","user":{"login":"tzulitai","id":5284370,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODQzNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5284370?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai","html_url":"https://github.com/tzulitai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-19T07:26:17Z","updated_at":"2017-07-19T07:26:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@pnowojski alright, that makes sense.\r\nYou don't actually need a separate Flink job because you can just add a completely non-attached graph that consumes from the topic within the same job.

Instead of testing for the effect, they tend to do the same thing as the actual code but in backwards.

My concern is this is a breaking change of the API and the new behavior will affect user's existing code. \r\nOn the other hand,  in RDBMS we can use the `SQL CREATE TABLE AS statement` to create a table from an existing table by copying the existing table's columns. When creating a table in this way, the new table will be populated with the records from the existing table (Based on the `SELECT` Statement). \r\nThis is a common operation, I think we need to support this functionality. \r\nBased on these considerations, I propose to retain the current `writeToSink` method, keep the current configure behavior to support the derived sink schema.  Add a new `insertInto` method to support the pre-defined schema, and will do type validation within it(for now only support dml insert in SQL, later we can add support for `create table as statement`, so that TableAPI and SQL's semantics are exactly same)\r\n\r\nI agree distinguishing the `insert` and `select` query method, but I'm concerned about the method name itself, `sql` covers all types of query, not limited to `select`.\r\nStandard sql dml includes the `select / insert / update / delete`, so if we need to distinguish the sub-type of query, I suggest the method named` select / insert` (or differs from the `select` method name in `table.scala`, named `dmlSelect / dmlInsert`), then do the corresponding check in each method. The insert method's return type can be declared as `Unit` rather than `null`.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\nThanks, Lincoln","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/316379636/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/316393424","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4350#issuecomment-316393424","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4350","id":316393424,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNjM5MzQyNA==","user":{"login":"greghogan","id":569655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2OTY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/569655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan","html_url":"https://github.com/greghogan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-19T13:49:05Z","updated_at":"2017-07-19T13:49:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Test updated.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/316393424/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/316393825","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4350#issuecomment-316393825","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4350","id":316393825,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNjM5MzgyNQ==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-19T13:50:36Z","updated_at":"2017-07-19T13:50:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 to merge","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/316393825/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/316401146","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4263#issuecomment-316401146","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4263","id":316401146,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNjQwMTE0Ng==","user":{"login":"wuchong","id":5378924,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNzg5MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5378924?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong","html_url":"https://github.com/wuchong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-19T14:14:35Z","updated_at":"2017-07-19T14:14:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@rtudoran I have exactly the same idea with you.

@rtudoran, thanks for updating the PR.\r\n\r\nI had a brief look at it and as I said before, I don't think we need additional ProcessFunctions for any of the `ORDER BY *time ASC OFFSET x FETCH y` cases. All cases (proctime and rowtime) can be implemented by extending the current functions for `ORDER BY`. \r\n\r\nAll we have to do is to\r\n- add a counter for `OFFSET` and not emit the first `x` rows (counter should be stored as state)\r\n- add a counter for `FETCH` and not emit more than `y` rows (counter should be stored as state).\r\n\r\nIf `OFFSET` or `FETCH` are not required, we can set `x` and/or `y` to `-1` and ignore the counters.\r\n\r\nOnce we have extended the current ProcessFunctions, we can also remove the additional methods in `DataStreamSort` and `SortUtil` because we always translate to the same `ProcessFunction` just with different values for `offset` and `fetch`. So we only have to extend the current methods in `DataStreamSort` and `SortUtil` to set the correct values for `offset` and `fetch` (either the values from the query or `-1` if not used) to the updated ProcessFunctions.\r\n\r\nThat should simplify the PR and require much less changes and code.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think,\r\nFabian","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/316757909/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/316760083","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4365#issuecomment-316760083","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4365","id":316760083,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNjc2MDA4Mw==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-20T16:35:01Z","updated_at":"2017-07-20T16:35:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks

We keep the current `TableSink` interface, but when registering a `TableSink` in a `TableEnvironment` we request field types (and optionally field names). Internally, the `TableEnvironment` calls `configure()` and stores the returned configured copy of the `TableSink` in the catalog. This would have the benefits that\r\n- we use the existing interface in a clean way and only need to update the documentation to explain both modes to use the interface.\r\n- the same `TableSink` implementation can be used with eager and lazy schema registration.\r\n\r\nI agree with your proposal for `writeToSink` and `insertInto`. So the method signature would be `Table.insertInto(tableSink: String, config: QueryConfig): Unit`, where `tableSink` would be the name of a registered `TableSink`.\r\n\r\nRegarding the names of the methods I'm not sure how well-known the distinction of `SQL`, `DML` and `DDL` is. You are of course right that `SELECT` and `INSERT` are part of `DML` (but also part of SQL which is the superset of `DML` and `DDL`). \r\n\r\nI think SQL is just better known than `DML` and many users might not be know what `DML` means.\r\nI'd propose the following two methods:\r\n- `sqlInsert(query: String, config: QueryConfig): Unit` and \r\n- `sqlSelect(query: String): Table` (we can add `sqlSelect` and deprecate `sql`).\r\n\r\nDoes that make sense to you?\r\nBest, Fabian","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/316959628/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/316980839","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4380#issuecomment-316980839","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4380","id":316980839,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNjk4MDgzOQ==","user":{"login":"rtudoran","id":16573790,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTczNzkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16573790?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtudoran","html_url":"https://github.com/rtudoran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtudoran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtudoran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtudoran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtudoran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtudoran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtudoran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtudoran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtudoran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtudoran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-21T11:48:44Z","updated_at":"2017-07-21T11:48:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@fhueske\r\nI did not understood initially that this is your suggestion. What you propose has the advantage that it is easy to maintain (as we consolidate the whole functionality) and a slight disadvantage that you have a couple of useless checks in some scenarios (e.g., you would still check the fetch condition even if you would have only offset or just the plain sorting). If this tiny performance price to pay is ok ...than clearly we can consolidate the implementation.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, even if this is the case i would still propose we keep the ProcTimeIdentitySortProcessFunction\r\nThis is for the scenario where you have the order by simply on the time (and no other field). In the case of simple sort we only had an identity map function to pass the events. For the case of offset/fetch we can either extend that or keep one different implementation that adds the state counters for offset/fetch. I propose we keep this later implementation.

- i do not understand why you would need to keep the counters for offset/fetch as states?\r\n\r\nAssuming we have in the buffer state with events for proctime T values (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\r\nYou want to emit them with offset 2 and fetch 2 (hence values 3 and 4)\r\n\r\nSo you will have the onTimer function when proctime moved and you can trigger computation for time T (i.e. at T+1)\r\n\r\nThe basic
