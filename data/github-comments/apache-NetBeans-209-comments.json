am baffled at how this Windows issue remains opened yet without a path to\r\nresolution. If the options fix continued to work it would be fine. It no\r\nlonger does. While it may duplicate a problem first discovered, in NB 13,\r\nthat the fix/hack no longer works makes this a new problem. I will have to\r\nabandon NetBeans as most of what I do is preparing presentations or write\r\nabout programming.\r\n\r\nI would be happy to look into this matter. I just need to know where in the\r\nEditor's code Select/Copy/Paste/Cut is handled. Or, is the default\r\nbehaviour of Java exclusively responsible for these operations and\r\ntherefore there is no dedicated code? Has an update defeated or disabled\r\nthe fix/hack? There must be an event where this disconnects from Windows\r\nand subsequently only works within the editor that could be identified.\r\n\r\nNow a short story. A few years ago I had some issues with Arquillian when\r\nteaching server side programming. I knew the developers at RedHat and they\r\nmade numerous suggestions. Eventually I resolved the issue. In a casual\r\ndiscussion with these developers they revealed that they did not have a\r\nsingle Windows machine in their office. They had never observed Arquillian\r\nrunning on Windows. So, may I ask, is anyone who is a committer to NetBeans\r\nworking on Windows rather than Linux or MacOS?\r\n\r\nI will now crawl back under my rock,\r\n\r\nKen Fogel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Thu, May 23, 2024, 2:20 AM Michael Bien ***@***.***> wrote:\r\n\r\n> Closed #7396 <https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/7396> as not\r\n> planned.\r\n>\r\n> —\r\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\r\n> <https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/7396#event-12904027002>, or\r\n> unsubscribe\r\n> <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AA7AMUKC5URVLSU5SV2Z7JDZDWDC5AVCNFSM6AAAAABIEQUAKGVHI2DSMVQWIX3LMV45UABCJFZXG5LFIV3GK3TUJZXXI2LGNFRWC5DJN5XDWMJSHEYDIMBSG4YDAMQ>\r\n> .\r\n> You are receiving this because you authored the thread.Message ID:\r\n> ***@***.***>\r\n>\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2127074135/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2127081995","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/7396#issuecomment-2127081995","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7396","id":2127081995,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5-yLIL","user":{"login":"geertjanw","id":5309985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMDk5ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5309985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw","html_url":"https://github.com/geertjanw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-23T13:14:40Z","updated_at":"2024-05-23T13:14:40Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"You've been pointed to the equivalent issue for IntelliJ IDEA in the past.

It was my first thought too but I got distracted by the exception in the log. `nbjavacapi` module isn't loaded so its the same symptom.\r\n\r\n@cho-mik this issue is fixed in NB 22 which should be available next week. If you want to use NB 21 till then, try resetting your config in `C:\\Users\\spamm\\AppData\\Roaming\\NetBeans\\21`. Once you start NetBeans again, create a new maven project right away without opening the plugin manager or the options and all modules should initialize properly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2129411898/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2129448505","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/7323#issuecomment-2129448505","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7323","id":2129448505,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5-7M45","user":{"login":"ralfuslongus","id":30657977,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjU3OTc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30657977?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralfuslongus","html_url":"https://github.com/ralfuslongus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralfuslongus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralfuslongus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralfuslongus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralfuslongus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralfuslongus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralfuslongus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralfuslongus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralfuslongus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralfuslongus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-24T12:44:35Z","updated_at":"2024-05-24T12:44:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I just stumbled upon this bug today with the same conditions: NB21, JDK21, sourcelevel21, Focused(instrumented) profiling.

The transformation that is applied there is an anonymous class in `com.sun.tools.javac.comp.AttrRecover.AttrRecover(Context)`. \r\n\r\nThis comment:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/617edf3f0dea2b73e4b444e085de2ad282826e31/src/jdk.compiler/share/classes/com/sun/tools/javac/comp/AttrRecover.java#L151-L154\r\n\r\nmakes no sense from my POV as the TreeTranslator expects the translated tree in `result`. If the translation result must not be null, the caller could be modified to check for null and only replace the tree if the translation is non-null (line 59 and following):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/617edf3f0dea2b73e4b444e085de2ad282826e31/src/jdk.compiler/share/classes/com/sun/tools/javac/tree/TreeTranslator.java#L54-L63\r\n\r\nOr the `AttrRecover` class needs to be adjusted to return set `result` to the input tree if it shall not be touched.\r\n\r\n@lahodaj would you mind having a look at this?
