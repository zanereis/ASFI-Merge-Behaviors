Here some points:\r\n\r\n- I'd need the full error output. If some template is expanded, would have to know for which\r\n  ops in mshadow_op.h. An obvious thing to try is to revert things back to before my changes\r\n  for these ops only\r\n- Why was the original issue closed? Something must have solved the problem, and now maybe\r\n   this is just a different problem? At least, we need error outputs for the new problem, and maybe\r\n   this should be a different issue?\r\n- What is your hunch what is happening here? What cc or cu code is actually built here?\r\n\r\nMy hunches of what to try:\r\n- The new math_functions-inl.h introduces a lot of functions exp, log, ... in the namespace\r\n   mxnet::op::math. Maybe this clashes with something else you are doing? One thing to try\r\n   would be to rename the namespace math => math_debug. This also needs mshadow_op.h\r\n   changes, but nowhere else (I think)\r\n- Figure out exactly which ops in mshadow_op.h are implicated, and then change their code\r\n   back to older versions\r\n\r\n- To explain what my changes did: The mshadow_op.h ops now consistently cast inputs to\r\n   float for all DType != double, but leave them double for DType = double. The computation\r\n   is then done in float or double, and if DType != double, we cast back to DType at the end.\r\n   The input is cast with static_cast<float>(a), the result is cast back with DType(result).\r\n- The code before my changes did things differently:\r\n   The forward ops were always computed in float, also if DType = double. Also, they would\r\n    do ::expf(a) instead of ::expf(static_cast<float>(a)), which should be the same.\r\n    More serious, the gradient (backward) ops were often doing computations in DType if\r\n    only arithmetic was involved (*, +, even /), but in float if math.h functions were involved.\r\n    This is plain wrong. In my changes, also all gradient ops cast to float, whether math.h\r\n    functions are involved or not\r\n\r\n@zhreshold How would this fail in CI in windows, etc., if it does not fail for all other PRs that passed CI since my changes?

The thing that looks most likely to be the problem in this line is the term \r\nexp.Eval(y, x)\r\nWhy? Simply because \"exp\" is the name of a parameter of the encompassing MapPlanProc() function and it is also the name of an arithmetic function (and you modified exactly this arith function by making it a template). So there are some hints, that this may cause a problem. \r\nWhat could go wrong here? Some  ideas: The compiler has to figure out at some point what it will do with exp.Eval(). According to this \"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/19cbwccf.aspx\" there may be the possibility, that \"exp\" is decided to be a pointer to an external function (i.e. a non-dependent variable) as the function parameter with the same name is a dependent variable (its type is dependent on template parameters). To quote this website:\r\n\"Nondependent names are looked up according to the usual rules and at the point of definition of the template. These names, being independent of the template arguments, are looked up once for all template specializations\". \r\nSo it could be that the compiler decided one time upfront that \"exp.Eval\" must be some kind of function pointer and no local variable and then later figures out that this is actually not the case (when it eventually expands the templates). This may be triggered by the fact that the compiler identifies the arithmetic function exp - when analyzing the template MapPlanProc first - as a non-dependent name and so assumes that in \"exp.Eval(X,Y)\"  the \"exp\" refers to the arithmetic function. At this point, it doesn't perform any analysis of template specializations. So it doesn't figure out that the arithmetic function \"exp\" has no method \"Eval\" at all (some compilers may be clever enough, but others may not and nvcc is somewhat \"special\" anyway). Then later, when it processes the first specialization (instantiation) of template \"MapPlanProc\", it also will try to instantiate \"exp.Eval()\". And then figures out that \"exp.Eval\" is no function or function pointer (in fact that exp.Eval is nowhere defined at all when exp is assumed to be the arithmetic exp) and then bails out (with a not very helpful error message). \r\n\r\nYour change made \"exp\" a template. Before it was a non-template function and the compiler could always figure out at the time of analyzing the template definition of MapPlanProc that the \"exp\" in exp.Eval() can't match that arithmetic function \"exp\". Now as \"exp\" is a template, it may not be able to figure that out as there could be some specialization of the \"exp\" template that actually has an \"Eval\" member (but specializations are handled after the decision that \"exp\" is bound to the  arithmetic function as this binding results in a preferred matching to a non-dependent name)\r\n\r\nWe certainly can make a philosophical discourse out of that. But I would recommend just to try it out and exchange the parameter \"const Plan exp\" in MapPlanProc to something like \"const Plan plan\"  and then do plan.Eval() inside and see whether it works. \r\n\r\nYou may ask  @zhreshold to try it out as PR8582 is currently failing on exactly this.
