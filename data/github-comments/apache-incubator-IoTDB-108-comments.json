Whether your team is comparing changes in a pull request or reviewing a single commit, Codecov will improve the code review workflow and quality.\r\n\r\n## Code coverage done right.®\r\n\r\n1. Upload coverage reports from your CI builds.\r\n2. Codecov merges all builds and languages into one beautiful coherent report.\r\n3. Get commit statuses, pull request comments and coverage overlay via our browser extension.\r\n\r\nWhen Codecov merges your uploads it keeps track of the CI provider (inc. build details) and user specified context, e.g. `#unittest` ~ `#smoketest` or `#oldcode` ~ `#newcode`. You can track the `#unittest` coverage independently of other groups. [Learn more here](\r\nhttp://docs.codecov.io/docs/flags)\r\n\r\nThrough **Codecov's Browser Extension** reports overlay directly in GitHub UI to assist in code review in [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/codecov/gedikamndpbemklijjkncpnolildpbgo) or Firefox (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/codecov/)\r\n\r\n*Highly detailed* **pull request comments** and *customizable* **commit statuses** will improve your team's workflow and code coverage incrementally.\r\n\r\n**File backed configuration** all through the `codecov.yml`. \r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n- Do you **merge multiple uploads** to the same commit? **Yes**\r\n- Do you **support multiple languages** in the same project? **Yes**\r\n- Can you **group coverage reports** by project and/or test type? **Yes**\r\n- How does **pricing** work?

Cloud (formerly SonarCloud) is a SaaS code analysis tool designed to detect coding issues in 30+ languages, frameworks, and IaC platforms.Your code is checked against an extensive set of rules that cover many attributes of code, such as maintainability, reliability, and security issues, on each merge/pull request.\r\n\r\nSonarQube Cloud integrates seamlessly into your GitHub workflow and provides clear guidance for resolving any code quality and security issues detected. The majority of popular languages can be analyzed automatically; no configuration is required!\r\n\r\nWith [SonarQube Cloud](https://sonarcloud.io/github), you get:\r\n\r\n-   Fast, precise static analysis and feedback on your code\r\n    \r\n-   Support for popular languages, frameworks, and IaC tools\r\n    \r\n-   Free analysis for open-source projects and private projects up to max 50k LoC\r\n    \r\n-   Automatic analysis of pull requests and branches with results reported inline\r\n    \r\n-   IDE Support with [SonarQube for IDE](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarlint/) integration\r\n    \r\n-   Quality Gate (added as a GitHub check) acting at two different levels - first, preventing you from merging pull requests that contain issues - and later, helping you to release only clean, safe code\r\n    \r\n-   Sign up for SonarQube free tier and begin scanning your private and public repositories\r\n    \r\n\r\nA [GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/sonarcloud-scan) is available in the marketplace to make it easy for you (for projects where automatic analysis isn't available). SonarQube Cloud also integrates smoothly with Jenkins, CircleCI, TravisCI, CirrusCI, and many other tools.\r\n\r\nA free tier is available that allows you to explore the benefits of SonarQube Cloud using your public and private repositories. We also provide a no-commitment, [14-day trial](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarcloud/signup/) of SonarQube Cloud Team for unlimited team members, up to 1.9M LoC, AI CodeFix recommendations, and more.

Although inconsistency will not affect usage, in order to unify the development and application environment, I think it is better to unify the two (or let requirements.txt include what setup specifies).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/2151595564/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/2151596096","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iotdb/pull/12601#issuecomment-2151596096","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/12601","id":2151596096,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCXnElM6APsBA","user":{"login":"HTHou","id":25913899,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTEzODk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25913899?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HTHou","html_url":"https://github.com/HTHou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HTHou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HTHou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HTHou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HTHou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HTHou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HTHou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HTHou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HTHou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HTHou/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-06T07:32:38Z","updated_at":"2024-06-06T07:32:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I find the version requirement in requirement.txt is `# Pandas Export pandas>=1.3.5` Should we unify these?\r\n\r\nYes, it makes sense.
