sorry. I failed to click the \"comment\" button after writing this:\n\nGood news! In #437 I switched `PAssert` so it no longer uses side inputs in most cases, but instead uses globally-windowed `GroupByKey`. Now almost all runners will be able to use `PAssert` from an early stage. You should be able to use `TestPipeline` and `PAssert` to test your runner using the test suite we provide.\n\nBut even before that, we can merge such a major development as this new runner into a feature branch as soon as it has some viability, so everyone has a place to collaborate. Since this runner does have tests that run some real pipelines, that is enough for a feature branch. After that, the criteria for merging into master are outlined in [this email from Frances](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-beam-dev/201605.mbox/%3CCAAzyFAxcmexUQnbF%3DYk0PLmM3f5e5BqwJz4%2BC5doRucLNxOh8w%40mail.gmail.com%3E).\n\nSo, first, we need to get the tests happy then we can merge into a feature branch. I will also give this another review right away.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/225645798/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/225646117","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/448#issuecomment-225646117","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/448","id":225646117,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNTY0NjExNw==","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-13T17:10:46Z","updated_at":"2016-06-13T17:10:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Since this is postcommit build breakage, I am going to merge to restore that signal.
