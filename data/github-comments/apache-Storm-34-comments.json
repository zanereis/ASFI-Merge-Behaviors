The only way I can think of to make it run an older version of your code it to explicitly point it to an older version of the code, but I could be wrong. Also when we run a  worker process the jar used is associated with the topology-id.  We cache it, but only for workers that are a part o the exact same topology instance.  Do you have a reproducible use case that we can use to debug this?</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612486145/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612465744","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4166#issuecomment-2612465744","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4166","id":2612465744,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI0NjU3NDQ=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-25T19:11:01Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T12:53:48Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=revans2\">revans2</a>:</i>\n<p>That would be great.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612465744/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/53313735","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/239#issuecomment-53313735","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/239","id":53313735,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMzEzNzM1","user":{"login":"revans2","id":3441321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDEzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3441321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2","html_url":"https://github.com/revans2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-25T19:17:15Z","updated_at":"2014-08-25T19:17:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@dgolombek The change looks fine to me.

However, if there is a possibility for mismatches due to merged classpaths, it would make sense to actively seek these out and issue a warning given the number of classes that storm will load on its own. I remember seeing an application sometime back that just populated a HashMap with the fully qualified class name as the key and the source directory of the jar as the value.

So we have added in URL encoded ids to the result of the REST APIs to allow us to not bother with doing the URL encoding in the browser.  That seems OK I guess.  But why are we not url decoding the url parameters in the REST API any more?  Is it because the ring framework already decodes them for us?  And I am really confused why in the visualization-data function we need to double url encode the ids in the link? From the look of it, it is because we take those parameters and place them in a new URL for the rest call.

So we have added in URL encoded ids to the result of the REST APIs to allow us to not bother with doing the URL encoding in the browser.  That seems OK I guess.  But why are we not url decoding the url parameters in the REST API any more?  Is it because the ring framework already decodes them for us?  And I am really confused why in the visualization-data function we need to double url encode the ids in the link? From the look of it, it is because we take those parameters and place them in a new URL for the rest call.
