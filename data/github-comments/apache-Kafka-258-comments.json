I started typing a really long response, but deleted it. I guess the key point is that if we never transitioned from `STARTING_TRANSACTION` to `IN_TRANSACTION`  at the time of commit or abort, it means that either there are no `send` or `sendOffset` calls attempted, or they have failed. In the former, the additional state will do what we want: if we are committing or aborting in this state, we know there is nothing to do. \r\n\r\nHOwever, if the `AddPartitions` or `AddOffsets` RPCs failed fatally, or have never been successfully acknowledged, we would --correctly-- be in an error state, and hence have no record of whether we ever got out of `STARTING_TRANSACTION` to `IN_TRANSACTION`. \r\n\r\nSo either we hack the transitions to the error state, or just maintain the separate variable. I think the separate variable is preferable.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/304188681/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/304189584","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/3148#issuecomment-304189584","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/3148","id":304189584,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNDE4OTU4NA==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-26T04:42:31Z","updated_at":"2017-05-26T04:42:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer
