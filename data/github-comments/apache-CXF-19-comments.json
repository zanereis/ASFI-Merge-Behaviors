you.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/1676393769/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/1676403160","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cxf/pull/1381#issuecomment-1676403160","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/1381","id":1676403160,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQMOR85j6-HY","user":{"login":"LeoWoerteler","id":545684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NTY4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/545684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoWoerteler","html_url":"https://github.com/LeoWoerteler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoWoerteler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoWoerteler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoWoerteler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoWoerteler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoWoerteler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoWoerteler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoWoerteler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoWoerteler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoWoerteler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-13T16:16:30Z","updated_at":"2023-08-13T16:16:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@reta @dkulp I guess that is the core of the question then. In CXF 3.5 it was possible to close only the `Response` but not the `WebClient` without severe consequences. After we had to upgrade to CXF 4.0.X because of the `javax.*` to `jakarta.*` move, now every `WebClient` that isn't being closed leaks a zombie thread, which eventually leads to OOM crashes. Was this always a misuse of the API (even though `WebClient` isn't even `AutoCloseable` and many examples/answers online say otherwise) and therefore the breakage is fine or is this a serious regression?\n\nIn my opinion the resource leak is easily fixable (for example via the `WeakReference`), so leaving it in would be very unfortunate. Missing a single unclosed `WebClient` or proxy anywhere in the code base during the CXF upgrade would introduce a memory leak. That makes the upgrade extremely risky.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/1676403160/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/1676421878","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cxf/pull/1381#issuecomment-1676421878","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/1381","id":1676421878,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQMOR85j7Cr2","user":{"login":"reta","id":509855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTg1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/509855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta","html_url":"https://github.com/reta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-13T17:42:16Z","updated_at":"2023-08-13T17:42:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> @reta @dkulp I guess that is the core of the question then.

Until CXF 3.5 it was evidently enough to close the `Response` to avoid leaking resources, and there are plenty of sources online that claim that. Now in 4.0 the same pattern is suddenly leaky.

SpringBusFactory does in code generation ?\r\nMoreover I've just tried in debug mode (with forcing 'fork' to false and having spring-context in dependencies, and I always fail in the `catch` clause

@ffang Why do we want the policy based interceptors added and what relation does it have to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CXF-8940 ?\r\n\r\nHi @coheigea ,\r\n\r\nCXF-8940 complains the issue that property \"ws-security.must-understand\" can't be honoured when Dom based ws-secuirty API is used, while it's working in Stax based ws-secuirty. \r\n\r\nAfter debugging, I realized that this issue only occurs when UsernameToken is used alone but no Security Binding(like HTTPS TransportBinding) in policy file. Actually in PolicyBasedWSS4JOutInterceptor.java we have code like\r\n```\r\n              boolean mustUnderstand =\r\n                MessageUtils.getContextualBoolean(\r\n                    message, SecurityConstants.MUST_UNDERSTAND, true\r\n                );\r\n            String actor = (String)message.getContextualProperty(SecurityConstants.ACTOR);\r\n\r\n            // extract Assertion information\r\n            AbstractBinding binding = PolicyUtils.getSecurityBinding(aim);\r\n\r\n            if (binding == null && isRequestor(message)) {\r\n                Policy policy = new Policy();\r\n                binding = new TransportBinding(org.apache.wss4j.policy.SPConstants.SPVersion.SP11,\r\n                                                 policy);\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            if (binding != null) {\r\n                WSSecHeader secHeader = new WSSecHeader(actor, mustUnderstand, saaj.getSOAPPart());\r\n                final Element el;\r\n                try {\r\n                    el = secHeader.insertSecurityHeader();\r\n                } catch (WSSecurityException e) {\r\n                    throw new SoapFault(\r\n                        new Message(\"SECURITY_FAILED\", LOG), e, message.getVersion().getSender()\r\n                    );\r\n                }\r\n```\r\nto honour property \"ws-security.must-understand\" when using dom based ws-security API, however, this interceptor isn't added OOTB if the policy file only contains UsernameToken but no Security Binding. \r\n\r\nTake a close look at UsernameTokenInterceptorProvider.java, the PolicyBasedWSS4JStaxOutInterceptor and PolicyBasedWSS4JStaxInInterceptor have been there already, that's why Stax based ws-secuirty can honour property \"ws-security.must-understand\" when the policy file only contains UsernameToken. And I believe PolicyBasedWSS4JOutInterceptor and PolicyBasedWSS4JInInterceptor should be added there to support DOM based ws-security.\r\n\r\nAlso, I believe we have a similar issue https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CXF-2890,\r\n and the fix for it is\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/cxf/commit/48b7dce3d977a1630cefb633fe88480ee0746b8f\r\n\r\nFreeman","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/1772784844/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/1772793116","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cxf/pull/1473#issuecomment-1772793116","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/1473","id":1772793116,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQMOR85pqq0c","user":{"login":"coheigea","id":472162,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MjE2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/472162?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coheigea","html_url":"https://github.com/coheigea","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coheigea/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coheigea/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coheigea/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coheigea/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coheigea/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coheigea/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coheigea/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coheigea/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coheigea/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-20T13:59:30Z","updated_at":"2023-10-20T13:59:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ffang The problem is that adding the DOM interceptors means that you are losing the whole benefit of the UsernameTokenInterceptor, which is a pure-streaming interceptor.

Plus, in UsernameTokenInterceptor, I see DOMUtils and hence dom api is used under the hood, so I don't think UsernameTokenInterceptor is stream based purely.\r\n\r\nPlease shed light here\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nFreeman","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/1772817281/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/1772902372","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cxf/pull/1472#issuecomment-1772902372","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/1472","id":1772902372,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQMOR85prFfk","user":{"login":"dkulp","id":91569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxNTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkulp","html_url":"https://github.com/dkulp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkulp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkulp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkulp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkulp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkulp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkulp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkulp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkulp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkulp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-20T14:58:09Z","updated_at":"2023-10-20T14:58:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Why would the out interceptor chain be called when there isn't a message?
