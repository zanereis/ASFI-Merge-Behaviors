am not supportive of this change as there is already a good and more flexible mechanism for users to setup their flows for this behavior.  And notable the version of this processor pre Apache had all this bundled into a single mechanism.  It was highly error prone and too limiting.  The current model allows the user substantial flexibility in how they choose to handle conflicts, renaming, archive locations.\r\n\r\nIn the current simpler form the user has a PutFile that if upon conflict they choose to fail.  On fail they can route to a different PutFile whereby the filename is changed first and so on.  You might suggest that 'fail' is not sufficient since there could be other types of failure like not enough disk space, etc.. and you want to know precisely that it failed due to a naming conflict.  If so the simpler change is to add a conflict resolution of 'namingconflict' and route to such a relationship.  But that distinction also in practice didn't turn out to be helpful.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1016690635/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1016743381","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5677#issuecomment-1016743381","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5677","id":1016743381,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM48mkXV","user":{"login":"pvillard31","id":11541012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTQxMDEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11541012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31","html_url":"https://github.com/pvillard31","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-19T18:21:36Z","updated_at":"2022-01-19T18:21:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @markap14 - merged into main","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1016743381/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1016759231","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5671#issuecomment-1016759231","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5671","id":1016759231,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM48moO_","user":{"login":"mcgilman","id":123395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzM5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman","html_url":"https://github.com/mcgilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-19T18:41:41Z","updated_at":"2022-01-19T18:41:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Reviewing...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1016759231/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1016815687","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5675#issuecomment-1016815687","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5675","id":1016815687,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM48m2BH","user":{"login":"joewitt","id":3057465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTc0NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3057465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt","html_url":"https://github.com/joewitt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-19T19:53:34Z","updated_at":"2022-01-19T19:53:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"All the goodness.

Thanks for contributing.  First we will need a JIRA to exist and the commit messsage should link to it.  The JIRA ideally will lay out the overall goal/intent (which appears to be to provide an openshift friendly image for NiFi).  Also, it looks like there are various versions/mechanisms for setting versions.  You'll want everything in maven version land set to 1.16.0-SNAPSHOT which is the current main and then where there need to be hardcoded version references in Dockerfiles and such presumably it would be 1.16.0.  I also see references to much older version of nifi in here.  Best to start fresh with what this would target which at present is 1.16.  So you can/should remove references to older versions of nifi and any associated special handling.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1016894070/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1017277446","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5686#issuecomment-1017277446","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5686","id":1017277446,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM48omwG","user":{"login":"pvillard31","id":11541012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTQxMDEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11541012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31","html_url":"https://github.com/pvillard31","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-20T09:28:42Z","updated_at":"2022-01-20T09:28:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1,

Specifically, writing the \"new\" file to a semi-permanent location prior to overwriting the existing file. So, the historical information is preserved, albeit prior to being \"in use\" by the controller service. Yet, this is perfectly adequate.\r\n\r\nThe idea of incorporating the functionality into the PutFile processor itself is that it seemed a logical extension of the processor's capability. It seemed convenient to add the option to the processor especially since doing so is fully backward compatible with existing behavior. Also, it has the advantage of not duplicating data and archiving a copy if there was ever only a single file by that name, i.e. if there was no need for an archived copy. \r\n\r\nI'm still not clear on the words of caution you've brought up based on past experience. However, you are correct that a NiFi flow can be configured to accomplish nearly the same functionality. Also, it just occurred to me that performing this in a flow can result in archiving a file only once per cluster, but putting it in the processor itself means each node in the cluster would redundantly archive the file.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1018666170/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1018779815","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5700#issuecomment-1018779815","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5700","id":1018779815,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM48uVin","user":{"login":"joewitt","id":3057465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTc0NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3057465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt","html_url":"https://github.com/joewitt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-21T19:01:39Z","updated_at":"2022-01-21T19:01:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"love it.  if build checks out +1 and please self merge","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1018779815/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1018783753","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5684#issuecomment-1018783753","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5684","id":1018783753,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM48uWgJ","user":{"login":"dmnewber","id":13324264,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzI0MjY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13324264?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmnewber","html_url":"https://github.com/dmnewber","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmnewber/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmnewber/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmnewber/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmnewber/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmnewber/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmnewber/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmnewber/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmnewber/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmnewber/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-21T19:07:58Z","updated_at":"2022-01-21T19:07:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @guimou, thanks for the PR!

In my idea, people would be able to build the images themselves, or we could have an external automated build process generating these specific/custom images without putting too much burden on the project. Having their definitions integrated into the NiFi code would make it easier to find them though, even if people had to build themselves.\r\nNow, if the project thinks it's a good idea and is keen to integrate those images, I could change the approach and extend the maven builds with openshift profiles that would source their files from the already existing docker/dockerhub folders, as well as from the openshift one, but that would then only contain its specific files. The thing I'm struggling with though is that the way the different images are built (nifi, registry, toolkit) is not really consistent (for registry for example it does not seem to be a maven build at all, whereas in nifi you find two different things, dockerhub and dockermaven...), so I'm not sure how I should do this...\r\nAnother less intrusive option would be to simply add instructions/script in the parent folder and build directly from there. Like this, the build context would authorize to pick files from diffent subfolders and minimize duplication. This would also allow to provide only \"recipes\" for OpenShift, but not integrate the full build and have to determine where to put and how to name those images.\r\nI'm open to any suggestion, whatever is the simple for the project and the users!\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1018849385/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1018860318","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5668#issuecomment-1018860318","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5668","id":1018860318,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM48upMe","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-21T21:07:45Z","updated_at":"2022-01-21T21:07:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the improvement @bbende!

for following up on this @tpalfy.\r\n\r\nHaving a NAR dependency can be problematic because it could pull in the META-INF directory with the Processor definition, which would result in the attempt to register the same processor more than once.  Excluding specific files from the destination NAR becomes problematic as well.\r\n\r\nIt seems like the best approach would require refactoring shared code to a new module, and then depending on that module in both `nifi-dbcp-service` and `nifi-snowflake-service`.  Perhaps named something like `nifi-dbcp-shared`?  That module would contain the shared code, but would not include the META-INF directory.  That type of approach should avoid potential issues that would result by attempting to depend on the existing DBCP JAR or NAR modules as currently defined.  That will require some refactoring, but it seems like the best approach when it comes to avoiding duplication.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1020179087/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1020451641","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5692#issuecomment-1020451641","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5692","id":1020451641,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM480ts5","user":{"login":"tpalfy","id":53442425,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNDQyNDI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53442425?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy","html_url":"https://github.com/tpalfy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-24T19:14:30Z","updated_at":"2022-01-24T19:14:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm not sure this approach is what we want.

One can remain ```nifi-dbcp-service``` and holds the code and we can have a ```nifi-dbcp-service-meta``` module that can have the META-INF.\r\n\r\nI understand that in this case the result would basically be the same but with this we can create a pattern that can be used generally for any future or existing module allow us to reuse any implementation code.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1020467938/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1020481969","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5692#issuecomment-1020481969","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5692","id":1020481969,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM4801Gx","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-24T19:50:11Z","updated_at":"2022-01-24T19:50:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"There is a good deal of code duplication in certain places right now, so this is not necessarily so different, but it is an opportunity to find a better approach.\r\n\r\nThe idea of a `nifi-dbcp-service-meta` sounds a good potential solution.

Thanks for the feedback!\r\n\r\nAbout the recovery test, please give me more information about your simulation. The PostgreSQL Replication Slot doesn't keep changes after the feedback (setAppliedLSN and setFlushedLSN functions), which is performed as soon as the change is received by the processor. Then, if you try to set the Start LSN property with an LSN already received, that will not work and the processor will start from the pending changes available in the slot. But you can test the opposite, I mean, you can request an LSN after many unreceived transactions, so the processor will skip them and start from the informed LSN (since the state is clean). Take a look at the integration test [testCDCStartLSN](https://github.com/davyam/nifi/blob/NIFI-4239/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-cdc/nifi-cdc-postgresql-bundle/nifi-cdc-postgresql-processors/src/test/java/org/apache/nifi/cdc/postgresql/processors/ITCaptureChangePostgreSQL.java#L902).\r\n\r\nTalking about the test with an existing slot, this is working. I tested it many times, including integration tests. I believe that, previously, you don't create the slot with **pgoutput** output plugin. For example:\r\n\r\n`SELECT pg_create_logical_replication_slot('slot_city', 'pgoutput');`\r\n\r\nProbably this is the reason. Anyway, now I see that this information needs to be included in the processor description. I will make this improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1020720083/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1020724700","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5710#issuecomment-1020724700","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5710","id":1020724700,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM481wXc","user":{"login":"davyam","id":32827630,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyODI3NjMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32827630?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davyam","html_url":"https://github.com/davyam","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davyam/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davyam/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davyam/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davyam/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davyam/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davyam/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davyam/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davyam/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davyam/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-25T01:45:42Z","updated_at":"2022-01-25T01:45:42Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> Fired off the workflow run for new contributor (thanks!) and closed the old referenced PR as requested.

I agree with you @guimou that there are real benefits to making NiFi images easier to deploy directly on OpenShift. I also agree with @dmnewber that it would be best not to duplicate the entire directory of files. While it may leave things more decoupled, it does increase the maintenance burden, as any any improvements to the default NiFi image would not also have to be done in more places (as we would probably want those same enhancements everywhere). We already have this problem today across docker hub and dockermaven variants, and plan to try to combine those so that they only differ one way, which is how the assembly artifacts are provided.\r\n\r\nI've started collecting ideas for how to improve our project structure for Docker images produced from the NiFi repository here, and I've added some of the goals of this PR to that list: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/NIFI/NiFi+Docker+Container+Improvements\r\n\r\nIf this is not urgent, I would suggest we tackle some of those goals, such as image build consolidation and then figure out how to incorporate base image variants as part of that, to take another look at this. I haven't looked at the PR closely yet, but aside from basing on ubi8/OpenJDK11, are there any other significant changes from the current NiFi Dockerfile?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1021406693/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1021418872","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5676#issuecomment-1021418872","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5676","id":1021418872,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM484Z14","user":{"login":"pvillard31","id":11541012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTQxMDEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11541012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31","html_url":"https://github.com/pvillard31","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-25T17:12:42Z","updated_at":"2022-01-25T17:12:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merged, thanks @turcsanyip - this is a nice improvement!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1021418872/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1021488524","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5687#issuecomment-1021488524","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5687","id":1021488524,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM484q2M","user":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-25T18:32:42Z","updated_at":"2022-01-25T18:32:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 LGTM, thanks for the improvement!

I think that is fine.\r\nI can remove the ```getSupportedDynamicPropertyDescriptor``` but I left the ```getDriver``` method intentionally because the ```Class.forName``` needs to be called there, otherwise it's not be able to find the driver.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1021512187/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1021522662","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5692#issuecomment-1021522662","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5692","id":1021522662,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM484zLm","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-25T19:15:50Z","updated_at":"2022-01-25T19:15:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Is there a reason this class is unable to use the `getDriver()` method from `DBCPConnectionPool`? The methods appear to be the same.  Although there may not be business logic duplication in `onConfigured()`, there is still a lot of setup code that should be shared.
