I think overall the right strategy here is to make Spark robust enough that it's hard or impossible to trigger OutOfMemory errors even if lots of data is being cached.

I unfortunately don't have access to one and am not an expert on mesos.\n\nIs there a race condition between when the scheduler backend increments totalExpectedExecutors and when we actually do the check to see if we have enough?  Meaning in this case we increment it as they come in as resource offers, we start the executors, it registers, then we do the check, so its possible once we get 1 in that totalExpectedExecutors =1 \\* minRegisteredRatio (say 100) == executorActor.size() (1) even though we really expect say 10 to come in?\n\nI think the same thing actually applies in standalone mode too but I missed it in previous

Right now, getPreferredLocations just returns a string, making this difficult to do.\n\nIt seems like we have a few choices:\n1. simply reorder the replicas as this change does (disadvantage is we lose some locality information)\n2. change the type of getPreferredLocations to return a type containing (hostname, Locality), rather than simply string\n3. getPreferredLocations could continue to return strings, but we could add \"cached:\" to the front of some.\n4. we could add a new function to RDD which would be used when available to return this information.\n\nThis patch is choice 1.\n\nChoice 2 might have some backwards compatibility issues.\n\nChoice 3 is a bit ugly, but is clearly the simplest.  Since colons are not valid characters in hostnames, it seems safe as well.\n\nChoice 4 is a bit trickier since if any code fails to implement the new function, we fall back to not knowing about cache locality, which isn't ideal.\n\nThoughts?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49472027/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49472246","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1452#issuecomment-49472246","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1452","id":49472246,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NDcyMjQ2","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-18T19:47:59Z","updated_at":"2014-07-18T19:47:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA tests have started for PR 1452.
