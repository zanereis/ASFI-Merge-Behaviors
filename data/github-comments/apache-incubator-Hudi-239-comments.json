The main outstanding debate is whether to materialize the `before` image of the records during write time (batch friendly) or derive it on the fly during query time (streaming friendly). Materializing costs more $$ in terms of storage cost + the additional compute cost for double writing. \r\n\r\nConceptually, deriving it on the fly (using just a `_hoodie_operation` field added to each record) needs more work on CDC query side. E.g:  let's take a CDC query for changes between commit times [t1, tN]. For each file group, we need to start with the latest file slice as of t1, extract rows that changed after or at t1, and extract its before image from the file slice before. Effectively, this will incur double reading. But even with materialization, we cannot really avoid this, can we? We will read the same amount of data.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1179324/171362012-649a9e6c-a102-47bc-956e-b7f174f68a17.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n@YannByron I get your point that in the materializing approach the CDC log block has both `before` and `after`, so its just a simple read to satisfy the CDC query. But even when deriving on-the-fly, the extra overhead is running a merge-sort (see danny's doc for the algorithm) like process between two base files with O(n +m ) comparisons. Depending on the schema, size of result set, this cost can be a small/large part of the overall CDC query cost. And let's not forget that Hudi already provides record level commit_time filters, that can be used to cut down reading the entire base file(s). (Pointing out since the RFC makes no attempt at contrasting how incremental query works). So, there can be a lot of cases, where this cost may not be as high as you think it could be","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1143238175/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1143251715","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/5436#issuecomment-1143251715","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/5436","id":1143251715,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5EJKMD","user":{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-01T08:02:22Z","updated_at":"2022-06-01T08:20:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"That said - I am wondering if we can avoid \r\n1.

Just that when we are deriving on-the-fly we don't write `before` and `after` into the CDC blocks\r\n\r\n@danny0405 We are waiting for your feedback here. Thoughts?

And other scenarios can re-use the existing files.\r\nbe afraid there will be a gap about this, so i just stress this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1145952554/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1145972813","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/5741#issuecomment-1145972813","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/5741","id":1145972813,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5ETihN","user":{"login":"bkosuru","id":7408351,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDgzNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7408351?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkosuru","html_url":"https://github.com/bkosuru","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkosuru/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkosuru/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkosuru/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkosuru/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkosuru/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkosuru/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkosuru/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkosuru/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkosuru/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-03T13:35:20Z","updated_at":"2022-06-06T13:55:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I am trying with option(\"hoodie.metadata.enable\", false) for the writer in 0.11.0. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1145972813/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1146071893","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/5728#issuecomment-1146071893","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/5728","id":1146071893,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5ET6tV","user":{"login":"danny0405","id":7644508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NDQ1MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7644508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405","html_url":"https://github.com/danny0405","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-03T15:22:28Z","updated_at":"2022-06-03T15:22:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> 邮件已收到！谢谢！                       薛超\r\n\r\nIt should be supported, see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-2767\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1146071893/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1146083416","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/5735#issuecomment-1146083416","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/5735","id":1146083416,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5ET9hY","user":{"login":"fzong76","id":62761064,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNzYxMDY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62761064?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fzong76","html_url":"https://github.com/fzong76","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fzong76/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fzong76/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fzong76/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fzong76/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fzong76/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fzong76/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fzong76/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fzong76/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fzong76/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-03T15:35:04Z","updated_at":"2022-06-03T15:35:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Yes.

supported in 0.11)\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nspark.sql(\"select * from default.mytable timestamp as of <time between initial and upsert
