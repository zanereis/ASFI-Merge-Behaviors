感谢回复，但这里我不明白的是scanNotActiveBroker时已经获取到了“不活跃”的broker地址和channel，并且从brokerLiveTable中删除了，为什么还需要在onChannelDestroy中再遍历一次brokerLiveTable来获取broker的地址，而不是直接用之前已经拿到的broker地址，所以想请教下这个是基于什么考虑的，或者说在什么场景下需要再做一次这个检查\r\n\r\n遍历的时候首先是根据channel是否相等来判断是否要删除的，这里应该是其他函数也会调用。当然这部分也确实可以进行优化。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/917535382/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/917535806","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/3296#issuecomment-917535806","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/3296","id":917535806,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl842sHw-","user":{"login":"RongtongJin","id":21963954,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTYzOTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21963954?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin","html_url":"https://github.com/RongtongJin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-12T02:17:59Z","updated_at":"2021-09-12T02:17:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merged","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/917535806/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/917586933","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/3342#issuecomment-917586933","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/3342","id":917586933,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl842sUP1","user":{"login":"RongtongJin","id":21963954,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTYzOTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21963954?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin","html_url":"https://github.com/RongtongJin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-12T08:18:23Z","updated_at":"2021-09-12T08:18:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"There
