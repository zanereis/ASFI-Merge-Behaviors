In the current implementation this is no longer true: when converting an array to a variant all elements are converted to VARIANT as well. Same for a MAP. Converting a ROW to a VARIANT generates a MAP indexed by the field names.\r\n\r\nFor the user there isn't much of a difference, and, as you may notice, the tests have changed very little. The runtime cost is different, though. Neither of the schemes dominates the other, whether one is preferable depends on the workload.\r\n\r\nI believe that this is similar to what Snowflake does, although I could not find a precise description of their exact implementation. But I believe that the TYPEOF function in Snowflake applied to an ARRAY will return just \"ARRAY\" and not \"INT ARRAY\" - so it resembles more the current implementation.\r\n\r\nVARIANT shines at handling JSON, so in future PRs we should add more JSON support. Unlike the existing Calcite JSON support, VARIANT represents the JSON natively, and does not need to convert back and forth to strings on every operation, saving many resources.\r\n\r\nI will give potential readers a few more days to review this.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/2524953060/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/2525402908","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/3562#issuecomment-2525402908","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/3562","id":2525402908,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAUNjNM6Whpcc","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-12-08T03:42:56Z","updated_at":"2024-12-08T03:42:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This pull request has been marked as stale due to 30 days of inactivity.
