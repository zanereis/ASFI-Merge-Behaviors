However, I am only able to reproduce this memory leak when I use Vert.x EventBus incorrectly. Based on how I'm reproducing it and the small snippet of source code you sent, it seems to me that you're sending messages to `handleExpiries` and expecting a reply. Based on the source code you sent, it seems by design that there will not be a response sent to `handleExpiries` messages. This appears to be what keeps these spans open.\r\n\r\nCan you tell me what EventBus method you're executing which sends a message to `handleExpiries`? Are you using one that supplies a non-null `replyHandler`? If so, I'm not sure this an issue that can be solved on Apache SkyWalking's end. I think the most that could be done is a warning message when a certain threshold is passed. I'm not exactly sure what threshold that would be though considering the amount of memory each un-replied message would require varies wildly (in your case 7k per).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/694797617/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/694819024","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/5479#issuecomment-694819024","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/5479","id":694819024,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5NDgxOTAyNA==","user":{"login":"pantovad","id":19255639,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjU1NjM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19255639?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pantovad","html_url":"https://github.com/pantovad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pantovad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pantovad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pantovad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pantovad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pantovad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pantovad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pantovad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pantovad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pantovad/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-18T11:40:27Z","updated_at":"2020-09-18T11:40:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@BFergerson thx vm for your findings.
