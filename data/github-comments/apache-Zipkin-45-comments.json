I particularly like the enclosed runner and think regardless of testcontainers we should switch to that. Really excited about this.\n\nAs you guessed I'm sure, I'm not keen on publishing a new test jar to avoid copy/pasting a 100 line text fixture. Copy/paste is fine during experimentation. Can you please reverse that part?\nDetails of why: -http and not already have setup due to the clients involved (ex sometimes I add a logging interceptor to the http one). Also, if this experiment proves itself, we'd put the testcontainers fixture in the existing zipkin test jar, not in the elasticsearch one. That would obviate a lot of the duplication. TL;DR; I really don't want to taint our public maven namespace for tactical reasons. Let's wait it out and see.\n\nAlso, I noticed the test duration went up by 2+ minutes, which is a significant bump. Wondering if this is mostly downloading the elasticsearch image or not. 2 minutes is a big enough issue to dig into as if we are to use testcontainers generically, we might be significantly increasing our build time as we port this to more things. Let me know what the source of the lag is (if you notice where it is). For example, a travis cache config might help (or might not)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/261755935/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/261765431","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/1410#issuecomment-261765431","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1410","id":261765431,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTc2NTQzMQ==","user":{"login":"bsideup","id":1050762,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTA3NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1050762?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsideup","html_url":"https://github.com/bsideup","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsideup/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsideup/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsideup/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsideup/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsideup/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsideup/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsideup/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsideup/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsideup/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-20T08:22:12Z","updated_at":"2016-11-20T08:22:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@adriancole ok, I will remove the dependency by duplicating the code\n\n> Wondering if this is mostly downloading the Elasticsearch image or not\n\nI spotted this as well, but... \nTestContainers does a good logging, so it's pretty easy to verify:\n\n```\n10:07:19.260 [main] INFO  o.t.d.DockerClientProviderStrategy - Found docker client settings from environment\n10:07:19.263 [main] INFO  o.t.d.DockerClientProviderStrategy - Docker host IP address is localhost\n10:07:19.287 [main] INFO  o.t.d.DockerClientProviderStrategy - Looking for Docker environment. <...>\n10:07:19.610 [main] INFO  o.testcontainers.DockerClientFactory - Connected to docker: <...>\n10:07:21.414 [main] INFO  o.testcontainers.DockerClientFactory - Disk utilization in Docker environment is 64% (10261 MB available )\n```\n\nDocker environment detection took 2 seconds in total.\n\nImages:\n\n```\n10:07:21.442 [main] INFO  üê≥ [elasticsearch:5.0.1] - Pulling docker image: elasticsearch:5.0.1.

Only thing we have right now is a note about timestamps (and an ad-hoc test I did once to see if maybe it worked or not).

I think it would be excellent. We have a Kibana dashboard at qvitoo and frequently need to correlate logs. Logary does all of the above collecting too. I'm working through the https://github.com/logary/logary/issues and have been for a while now; the next two parts is creating a complete C# facade like the existing Logary.Facade, improving how derived metrics are configured and then create examples including ones with Zipkin in them. This would enable e.g. sending a snapshot 1 minute rolling average together with the span, together with the annotations, that are sent to Zipkin.\r\n\r\nHowever, Logary's API is now well geared towards the logging structure needed for Zipkin; hierarchical passing-down of loggers, applying middleware on the fly (with TimeScope), or alternatively correlating span annotations in the Logary Zipkin target. So the extra work needed to fully support Zipkin now, is very small.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/262890870/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/262991427","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/1414#issuecomment-262991427","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1414","id":262991427,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2Mjk5MTQyNw==","user":{"login":"fedj","id":9842366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NDIzNjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9842366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedj","html_url":"https://github.com/fedj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-25T16:26:44Z","updated_at":"2016-11-25T16:26:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@adriancole Currently it's just a link so it depends on your browser settings (I guess).
