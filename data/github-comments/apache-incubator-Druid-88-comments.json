Especially if the lookup isn't a simple \"query some DB and get a value for some ID\".

There is a service that maintains a server view and returns a snapshot for the given query, which is similar to what #2282 does. And using the server view snapshot, Spark driver submits a Spark application that does something similar to what a Druid Broker does. If #2282 gets merged, I plan to eliminate the server view on my side and query Broker for the snapshot instead.\n\nWhat the Spark driver and application do is to chunk the query into multiple parts (segments) and spawn multiple intermediate-level brokers that process a specific number of segments. And then the intermediate results get merged by the final stage broker. There is only one level of intermediate merging for now, but I might make the number of intermediate levels configurable. The number of segments that are queried simultaneously is configurable so I can control how many segments are queried at once to the historical nodes, instead of querying everything at once. It takes more time to get the results back from the spark-druid project due to the initialization time of Spark application and each Druid broker. However, query failure rate is very low compared to querying Druid broker (no OOMEs and timeouts). \n\nCurrently, Spark drivers are run locally. Since Spark requires (or highly recommends) each SparkContext to be on separate JVM, my service spawns a new Java process for Spark Driver each time it receives a new query. This is fine for testing purpose, but not too good for production. My next step is to integrate it with Mesos so Spark driver for Druid queries can be run on Mesos and I wouldn't have to worry about managing resources.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/220707228/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/220707271","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/2476#issuecomment-220707271","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2476","id":220707271,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMDcwNzI3MQ==","user":{"login":"ottomata","id":1626054,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjYwNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1626054?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomata","html_url":"https://github.com/ottomata","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomata/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomata/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomata/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomata/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomata/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomata/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomata/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomata/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomata/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-20T20:12:58Z","updated_at":"2016-05-20T20:12:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"We have problems with this.

IMO getting the data into Spark is nice in and of itself, since it means a user can do further processing there in a distributed way, instead of streaming results out directly to/through a single machine.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/220725851/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/220727140","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/2998#issuecomment-220727140","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2998","id":220727140,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMDcyNzE0MA==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-20T21:51:45Z","updated_at":"2016-05-20T21:52:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Some more benchmarks, this time on a c4.8xlarge with a 31 thread processing pool, varying the number of segments to see how well the concurrent merging scales.

Charles' comment about totally removing the other two methods I think is legit.  I see two paths forward:\n1. We could expand this PR to remove those methods as well and update all of the individual call sites.  That would mean that the PR cannot actually be merged until we have a backwards incompatible release, 'cause it's possible that someone has implemented their own Query flow.\n2. We could accept this PR as is for now and essentially declare the `Segment` interface to be experimental and in-flux.  When we have it solidified, we do another PR to remove the other methods and declare things good.\n\nI'm generally in favor of Option 1, if we are ok with doing a backwards incompatible release in the very near future (i.e. this gets merged without sitting here in the PR queue for a really long time).  If we are not ok with that, then I think we need to take approach 2.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/221351319/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/221354780","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/2330#issuecomment-221354780","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2330","id":221354780,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMTM1NDc4MA==","user":{"login":"jisookim0513","id":3820496,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjA0OTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3820496?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jisookim0513","html_url":"https://github.com/jisookim0513","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jisookim0513/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jisookim0513/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jisookim0513/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jisookim0513/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jisookim0513/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jisookim0513/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jisookim0513/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jisookim0513/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jisookim0513/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-24T18:04:54Z","updated_at":"2016-05-24T18:04:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@gianm not yet :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/221354780/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/221366175","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/2990#issuecomment-221366175","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2990","id":221366175,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMTM2NjE3NQ==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-24T18:46:16Z","updated_at":"2016-05-24T18:46:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm in favor of 2 for the time being, it seems more straightforward to merge that in for 0.9.2.

The speedup on a single-longSum-agg timeseries query was about 20%, which is good but not as good as the 60% that @xvrl got by also doing block reads and avoiding offset materialization.\n\nSince @xvrl's implementation didn't support filters though, it remains to be seen where in between 20% and 60% we would end up with something that _does_ support filters but is also a bit smarter than just
