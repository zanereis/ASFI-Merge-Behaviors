It would be great if we can merge #2097 before the release.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1631705078/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1631709226","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2129#issuecomment-1631709226","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/2129","id":1631709226,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc5hQegq","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-12T01:15:58Z","updated_at":"2023-07-12T01:30:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## [Codecov](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2129?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=apache) Report\n> Merging [#2129](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2129?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=apache) (e0ce3e3) into [master](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/tinkerpop/commit/3e610e975a25299439853cba2a10a4ddf52f7679?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=apache) (3e610e9) will **increase** coverage by `0.01%`.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n```diff\n@@             Coverage Diff              @@\n##             master    #2129      +/-   ##\n============================================\n+ Coverage     74.80%   74.81%   +0.01%     \n- Complexity    12044    12049       +5     \n============================================\n  Files          1027     1027              \n  Lines         62181    62181              \n  Branches       6861     6861              \n============================================\n+ Hits          46512    46521       +9     \n+ Misses        13118    13114       -4     \n+ Partials       2551     2546       -5     \n```\n\n\n[see 7 files with indirect coverage changes](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2129/indirect-changes?src=pr&el=tree-more&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=apache)\n\n:mega: We’re building smart automated test selection to slash your CI/CD build times.

I will try to complete a full review today.\r\n\r\nIf possible, could you rebase your branch to [#3.5-dev](https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/tree/3.5-dev) and target the PR to that branch as well? That will ensure that these changes will make it into all of the upcoming releases (3.5.7, 3.6.5, 3.7.0). If this is too much of a hassle don't worry about it, we can fix it up during the merge.\r\n\r\nIn case you aren't aware, we just kicked off code freeze week for our upcoming releases. In my opinion this change is small enough that we can sneak it in during code freeze as long as there are no significant concerns from review.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1650179876/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1650376864","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2158#issuecomment-1650376864","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/2158","id":1650376864,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc5iXsCg","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-25T19:01:59Z","updated_at":"2023-07-25T19:13:42Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## [Codecov](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2158?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=apache) Report\n> Merging [#2158](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2158?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=apache) (e6783ff) into [3.6-dev](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/tinkerpop/commit/489e00b2a9c1f3c5272450b0639468a15941e158?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=apache) (489e00b) will **decrease** coverage by `0.07%`.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n```diff\n@@              Coverage Diff              @@\n##             3.6-dev    #2158      +/-   ##\n=============================================\n- Coverage      75.26%   75.19%   -0.07%     \n+ Complexity     12253    12244       -9     \n=============================================\n  Files           1050     1050              \n  Lines          62856    62856              \n  Branches        6887     6887              \n=============================================\n- Hits           47308    47266      -42     \n- Misses         13002    13053      +51     \n+ Partials        2546     2537       -9     \n```\n\n\n[see 10 files with indirect coverage changes](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2158/indirect-changes?src=pr&el=tree-more&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=apache)\n\n:mega: We’re building smart automated test selection to slash your CI/CD build times.

As Valentyn mentioned this will require support for additional types and more testing. I also think it would be nice if the tests were to use a `GraphTraversal` to construct the `Bytecode` similar to what is done in the python translator tests, I believe this would make the tests easier to read and write. Let me know if you need any help with this.\r\n\r\nThere is a bit of a time crunch if you want to get this in our upcoming release as we are currently in code freeze.

I will try to complete a full review today.\r\n> \r\n> If possible, could you rebase your branch to [#3.5-dev](https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/tree/3.5-dev) and target the PR to that branch as well? That will ensure that these changes will make it into all of the upcoming releases (3.5.7, 3.6.5, 3.7.0). If this is too much of a hassle don't worry about it, we can fix it up during the merge.\r\n> \r\n> In case you aren't aware, we just kicked off code freeze week for our upcoming releases.

As Valentyn mentioned this will require support for additional types and more testing. I also think it would be nice if the tests were to use a `GraphTraversal` to construct the `Bytecode` similar to what is done in the python translator tests, I believe this would make the tests easier to read and write. Let me know if you need any help with this.\r\n> \r\n> There is a bit of a time crunch if you want to get this in our upcoming release as we are currently in code freeze. I think all of the python translator tests will need to be translated over and need to pass before we can proceed here. Also it would ideally be completed tomorrow to avoid jeopardizing the release. Please let me know if you have any questions regarding this.

To build off of Valentyn’s comments once again, I think there are still additional types that will need to be supported in order for the translator to be considered complete. Support for the following will all be needed:\r\n\r\n- Translation of nested structures (within lists and maps)\r\n- Primitive types (Char, Byte/int8, Short/int16)\r\n- More common structure types (Date, Datetime, UUID, BigInteger, BigDecimal)\r\n- Strategies\r\n\r\nThe [python translator](https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/master/gremlin-python/src/main/python/gremlin_python/process/translator.py) is a good reference to follow for this.\r\nThere is still an opportunity for this to be merged tomorrow morning (Thursday in the Americas) if its complete although the release process is already well underway so this would be the final chance to make it into the upcoming release. If there is only minor tweaks needed tomorrow morning we may be able to assist with getting it finished up and into the release.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nCole","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1652818438/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1652847814","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2120#issuecomment-1652847814","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/2120","id":1652847814,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc5ihHTG","user":{"login":"dependabot[bot]","id":49699333,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDk2OTkzMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/29110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/dependabot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-27T03:12:23Z","updated_at":"2023-07-27T03:12:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks like prettier is up-to-date now, so this is no longer needed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1652847814/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1652852644","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1956#issuecomment-1652852644","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1956","id":1652852644,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc5ihIek","user":{"login":"Cole-Greer","id":112986082,"node_id":"U_kgDOBrwH4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112986082?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer","html_url":"https://github.com/Cole-Greer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-27T03:20:51Z","updated_at":"2023-07-27T03:20:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@dependabot rebase","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1652852644/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
