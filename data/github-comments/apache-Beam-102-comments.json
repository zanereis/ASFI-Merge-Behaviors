I can translate to more general terms, the issue is: There is a module inheriting configuration from the `beam-parent` root `pom.xml`, but the root configuration is incorrect for this module.\r\n\r\nThere are typically at least two fixes:\r\n1. Change the root `pom.xml` configuration.\r\n1. Override the root `pom.xml` configuration in the specific module.\r\n\r\n(with \"fix a bug somewhere else\" as an obvious third.)\r\n\r\nIn my view, the root `pom.xml` is probably correct as-is -- as Beam is \"java7 by default\", we want this restriction to apply to all modules by default. Instead, modules that want to use java8 are making an explicit choice and should override the java7 enforcement locally.\r\n\r\n(I am also generally leery of a change to Beam solely to support a break in a Google-internal Maven module.)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOf course there's even more info I can provide about the root cause here.\r\n\r\n* If the Dataflow worker module allows java8, it could/should be overriding this check at the module level.\r\n* The enforcement was actually added as a retroactive test for this exact issue -- upgrading `error_prone_annotations` broke the SDK core from building with JDK7. So I'm confident beam parent is correct.\r\n* And finally, since i know about this specific issue:\r\n    1. `error_prone_annotations` requiring java8 is actually a bug. It was introduced in 2.0.13 and fixed in 2.0.15. (And applied to Beam in https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/1875).\r\n    1. The Dataflow worker can either apply the same fix as in that PR, or more likely should simply inherit the version of `error_prone_annotations` from the root pom.xml `dependencyManagement` as part of the cleanup in bringing in the change in #1875 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/276907428/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/276909964","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/1904#issuecomment-276909964","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/1904","id":276909964,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NjkwOTk2NA==","user":{"login":"dhalperi","id":526415,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNjQxNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/526415?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi","html_url":"https://github.com/dhalperi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-02T09:37:55Z","updated_at":"2017-02-02T09:39:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'll note that I avoided an issue you implicitly raised: whether or not https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-1357 is a bug.
