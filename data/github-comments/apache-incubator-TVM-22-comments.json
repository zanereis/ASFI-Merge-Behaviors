This works as I expected the if statement to work.\r\n\r\nLooking through the python code, the only place that I find if statements is in the ir_builder.  That alone is a fairly confusing concept because that appears to avoid the use of constructs like compute_op and does in fact write directly to buffers, at least in tests.  So working at the ir_builder level appears to produce imperative code.  In fact, in a lot of cases, it appears to me that working at the ir_builder level allows more freedom.  \r\n\r\nHonestly I have a *lot* more questions to ask; is there an appropriate place to start asking them?  For instance, the rules for kernel combining; it appears throughout both tvm and nnvm that eltwise operations are combined into any other operation but outside of those there is limited kernel combining.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/375361905/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/375428766","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/1027#issuecomment-375428766","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1027","id":375428766,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NTQyODc2Ng==","user":{"login":"eqy","id":2239616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzk2MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2239616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy","html_url":"https://github.com/eqy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-22T19:26:24Z","updated_at":"2018-03-22T19:26:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This is confusing because the error is complaining about `llvm` not being enabled, though `llvm` should not be a requirement for CUDA codegen (https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/master/docs/how_to/install.md).\r\n\r\nCan you verify that the target is the CUDA GPU?

am also less familiar with clojure users than one might think.  I like it and am very productive with it so that is good enough for me.  TVM is a *great* counterpart to clojure regardless as the Venn diagrams of their respective strengths do not overlap. \r\n\r\n\r\nI sprinted to get the above to work; it is really more of a vision of what could be than a reality.  I only support injective kernels and I did the kernel combining manually as opposed to using the scheduling system to do it.  The TOPI library has a *lot* of very good complex pieces that I want to comb through and the other articles on the tvmlang.org page contain quite a lot of valuable information.\r\n  \r\n\r\nSo, thanks, I will start working on what will probably be a series of blogposts because I am targeting at least 2 non-overlapping audiences; the core talent behind clojure and the core talent behind tvm.
