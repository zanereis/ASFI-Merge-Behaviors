I think effectively that we cant expect to have any existing implementation of HIFIO to be included in the examples, however I would like to have a clear criteria to decide what implementations should be included as examples, for that reason I opened the discussion in the mailing list. IMO we should only have as examples the implementations of HIF that don't exist as native IOs, so once the native implementation is there they shouldn't be there (e.g. I would expect that both of the current examples get removed once we have their native implemationts (e.g. Elasticsearch 5 and Cassandra).\r\nThe problem with having this PR only as documentation (e.g. in the website) is that APIs can change, and the code in the website can become outdated, at least we will discover this by having the implementation in the repo. But well since you have the other PR for the native implementation, maybe it makes sense to close this one in favor of the beam-site one.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/304976460/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/304980088","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3259#issuecomment-304980088","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3259","id":304980088,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNDk4MDA4OA==","user":{"login":"dhalperi","id":526415,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNjQxNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/526415?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi","html_url":"https://github.com/dhalperi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-30T19:18:05Z","updated_at":"2017-05-30T19:18:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"R: @jbonofre \r\n\r\nIf LGTY can you test manually and merge?

There seems to be some mess-up, I find that these files are actually indented properly in my local git however when I committed these changes they did not reflect in my fork (which I did not realize until your comments). I would correct this and double check before I get this for review.\r\n\r\nAlso I have a few questions that would help me addressing the major comments :\r\n\r\n**1. Use of BoundedSource -**\r\n   I was looking into some more details on the aspect of splits and stumbled across this - https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HCatalog+Configuration+Properties. There seems to be a way to indicate HCatalog a 'desired' number of splits using the config parameter - 'hcat.desired.partition.num.splits'. However this is used as an 'hint' by HCatalog and does not guarantee that the exact number of desired splits will be achieved. Though this is a best-effort approach, does it make sense to implement this split logic and consider keeping it as a BoundedSource as this is the best attempt to get the desired number of splits. Else I can break this up as DoFns as you suggested.\r\nPlease let me know your thoughts on this.\r\n\r\n**2. Lot of config for embedded Hive source**\r\n  I completely agree with your comments and in fact felt the same way myself too. This is the only suitable  embedded Hive source that was available for the specific use-case. There are two config files in total viz. hive-site.xml and hive-log4j2.properties. I guess the log4j props can be removed however hive-site.xml contains the config params required to bring up the embedded Hive server, I will try to see if there is an alternate for this. In case if I do not find an alternate, it might have to stay on. @iemejia , please let me know if you have any pointers to avoid the usage of hive-site.xml\r\n\r\n**3. Rest of the comments**\r\nI agree with rest of your comments, I will address them as specified.\r\n\r\nAppreciate all your efforts in reviewing this, being my first contribution here I am learning a lot from you folks and thankful for all your guidance and support in making this work

not sure if I follow but this seems terribly complex for what it brings to the table, no?\r\n\r\nI agree that the stable contract is super important and we need to respect it but this is a 'leaky/special case' as is the case also for other publicly exposed inner classes of still Experimental parent classes (I suppose we should have a good chunk like this).\r\n\r\nFor example think about KafkaIO that is Experimental, imagine that we need to change the Read class to rename a method, for me this is not a breaking change considering the parent class is Experimental, however Read is publicly exposed and not marked as Experimental, so applying the current logic that would mean that we can't evolve it, invalidating the whole goal of marking things Experimental.\r\n\r\nI think what we need is to define Experimental as an 'inheritable' property to inner classes even at least from a conceptual point of view because the SDK does not enforce this.
