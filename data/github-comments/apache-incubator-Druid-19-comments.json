@T0aD,\n\nI don't believe this is a software problem as much as it is a setup problem. Druid's realtime ingestion is designed to block ingestion is there are too many pending persists. This is to prevent nodes from running out of memory and crashing entirely. The times seen for creating some of your dimensions are absolutely insane and completely not normal, and points to improper configuration or improper setup.\n\nI'm going to repeat what I've mentioned a few times already. Given the tidbits of information I have seen about your cluster, I strongly believe that your cluster is misconfigured. We'd be very happy to help straighten things out, but we need more information about how you guys are setting things up.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/97664446/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/97664532","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/1315#issuecomment-97664532","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1315","id":97664532,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk3NjY0NTMy","user":{"login":"fjy","id":428325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODMyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy","html_url":"https://github.com/fjy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-30T05:13:22Z","updated_at":"2015-04-30T05:13:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@fqtyfz I am not sure exactly what your specific question is, but at first glance, this is your error:\n\n1) Not enough direct memory.

: I migrated the data off of persistent ZK nodes and into metadata\n\nNow here is how namespace populating works:\n1. The namespace serving nodes announce (through `Announcer`) that it exists\n2. The Coordinator listens for this announcement and fires off a list of namespaces to the node\n3. The Coordinator regularly polls the metadata and POSTs the most recent list to the namespace servicing nodes on each update round.\n4. The namespace servicing nodes determine what to add or drop each time the new list is sent to them.\n\nSince everything is loaded everywhere this approach is an \"at least once announcement\" kind of approach and things eventually settle onto a state as the leading coordinator keeps polling the metadata and spitting out the \"correct\" state to each
