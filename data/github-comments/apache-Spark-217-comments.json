addressed comments. Among them: \n1. Rename HashShuffleBlockManager to FileShuffleBlockManager since it mainly handle block in File way. Though say sort based shuffle manager's own ShuffleBlockManager might also use File, but it might use another more specific name.\n2. I still keep the shuffleManager inside blockManager, the main reason is that the netty staff need to access shuffleManager upon blockManager init, while in this time SparkEnv not fully created yet, you can not access shuffleManager though env.get approaching. Then you had to pass in shuffleManager to blockManager as a parameter which further complicate blockManager's interface. so to keep it simple, I think we might keep it this way until one day we did get rid of netty staff. And more, since the current BlockManager's logic depends on shuffleManager a lot, and there are no e.g. standalone \"shuffleManagerMaster\" things, so all shuffle data fetch works go through blockManager's interface firstly anyway, so it seems to me not totally unreasonable  to put shuffleManager inside BlockManager?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/48559404/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/48560066","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1346#issuecomment-48560066","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1346","id":48560066,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NTYwMDY2","user":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-10T02:54:28Z","updated_at":"2014-07-10T02:54:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi, I'm wondering if `MapType` will have something like `containsNull` for `ArrayType`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/48560066/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/48560796","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1327#issuecomment-48560796","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1327","id":48560796,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NTYwNzk2","user":{"login":"aarondav","id":1400247,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDAyNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1400247?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav","html_url":"https://github.com/aarondav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-10T03:08:44Z","updated_at":"2014-07-10T03:08:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Honestly, I like this change, because it's generally good practice to minimize the amount of work done inside constructors.
