Does it really resolve the problem your describe in issue #2220\r\n\r\nThe improve in this PR has two points:\r\n1. Reduce the interval of publish version daemon and don't wait 2 rounds before handling publish result. (which is very meaning for very fast stream load, such as tens of milliseconds or hundreds of milliseconds)\r\n\r\n2. Change the write lock to read lock when ` getReadyToPublishTransactions` \r\n\r\n\r\nUnder high concurrent, If the single stream load need tens of seconds,  the bottleneck is BE,\r\nnot FE, I will continue tracking it.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/557963522/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/558028743","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/issues/2290#issuecomment-558028743","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/2290","id":558028743,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1ODAyODc0Mw==","user":{"login":"Seaven","id":5609319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MDkzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5609319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seaven","html_url":"https://github.com/Seaven","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seaven/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seaven/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seaven/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seaven/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seaven/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seaven/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seaven/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seaven/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seaven/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-25T07:33:57Z","updated_at":"2019-11-25T07:33:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"OK.

nullable_table where k1=(select k2 from nullable_table);\r\n```\r\n\r\n查询规划：assert row count node 是 1，也就是下层最多有一行结果，否则查询失败。\r\n\r\n```\r\n+---------------------------------------------------+\r\n|

The TableProperty class needs to be more general.\r\n\r\n\tFor example, there may be only one variable in class: `Map<String, String> properties`\r\n\t\r\n\tFor dynamic partition related properties, uniformly use the following key-value format:\r\n\t\r\n\t```\r\n\t\"dynamic_partition.prop1\" = \"val1\",\r\n\t\"dynamic_partition.prop2\" = \"val2\"\r\n\t```\r\n\t\r\n\tJust put a map, and then different categories of properties are distinguished with different prefixes. \r\n\tThe map is mainly to facilitate the subsequent addition of other categories of properties, \r\n\tand o need to modify the FeMetaVersion.\r\n\t\r\n\tAfter that, you can write a class named, for example, DynamicPartitionProperty, separately. \r\n\tThis class is built from `properties` map, and no need to be persisted to meta data.\r\n\t\r\n\tFor example, in the `readFields()` method of TableProperty, you can write:\r\n\t\r\n\t```\r\n\tpublic void readFields () {\r\n\t\t... read the property map first ...\r\n\t\tthis.dynamicPartitionProperty = buildDynamicPropertyFromPropertyMap(properties);\r\n\t\tthis.someOtherProperty = buildSomeOtherPropertyFromPropertyMap(properties);\r\n\t\t...\r\n\t}\r\n\t```\r\n\t\r\n\tIn subsequent use, you can directly use the parsed content in dynamicPartitionProperty\r\n\twithout having to get it from the `properties` map and then parse it.\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n2. In my opinion, the TableProperty class, is a kind of static class, and only need to be modified. \r\nwhen the user changes the relevant property's meta-information (such as modifying the information about how to create dynamic partition).\r\n\t\r\n\tIn other words, you should only modify the contents of the TableProperty in the operations of \r\n\t`create a table`, `stop dynamic partitioning`, `modify dynamic partition metadata`, or `start dynamic partition`.\r\n\t\r\n\tThe `DynamicPartitionScheduler` does not need to modify the TableProperty class when it automatically creates partitions.\r\n\tFirst, after the partition is automatically created, the new partition information has been saved and persisted in the table's partition information.\r\n\tSecondly, infos which `ShowDynamicPartitionStmt` needs to be displayed, such as `LastSchedulerTime`, does not actually need to be persisted.\r\n\tThe user usually only cares about the success of the last time and the current state, so this information will be available after the FE restarts and the \tDynamicPartitionScheduler is executed again.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/560970173/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/560994176","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/issues/2341#issuecomment-560994176","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/2341","id":560994176,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MDk5NDE3Ng==","user":{"login":"kangkaisen","id":9894906,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4OTQ5MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9894906?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangkaisen","html_url":"https://github.com/kangkaisen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangkaisen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangkaisen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangkaisen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangkaisen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangkaisen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangkaisen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangkaisen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangkaisen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangkaisen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-03T04:34:24Z","updated_at":"2019-12-03T04:34:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Nice

timeline for this question is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. For some reason, the master have lost contact with the other two followers . Judging from the logs of the master, for almost 40 seconds, the master did not print any logs. It is suspected that it is stuck due to full gc or other reasons, causing the other two followers to think that the master has been disconnected.\r\n\r\n2. After the other two followers re-elected, they continued to provide services.\r\n\r\n3. The master node is manually restarted afterwards. When restarting it for the first time, it needs to rollback some committed logs, so it needs to be closed and restarted again. After restarting again, it returns to normal.\r\n\r\nThe main reason is that the master got stuck for 40 seconds for some reason. This issue requires further observation.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, in order to alleviate this problem, we decided to set bdbje's heartbeat timeout as a configurable value. The default is 30 seconds. Can be configured to 1 minute, try to avoid this problem first.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/561145491/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/561495344","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/issues/2142#issuecomment-561495344","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/2142","id":561495344,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MTQ5NTM0NA==","user":{"login":"yangzhg","id":9098473,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwOTg0NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9098473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg","html_url":"https://github.com/yangzhg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-04T06:18:35Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T06:18:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"这个问题的原因是在 be 和fe 的代码中我们对于数字和字符串的算数运算处理逻辑导致的，在字符串和数字做算数运算时 字符串会默认cast 成 double 类型。不同的数据库对于这个问题的处理也不同，比如postgres 不支持这种操作，mysql 支持，mysql 的逻辑是匹配字符串前缀 转换成数字，前缀没有数字则是0 比如 `1 + '1' = 2`, `1 + '1a' = 2` , `1 + 'a' = 1` , `1 + 'a1' = 2` , 我们目前的代码部分兼容了mysql 的操作，但是字符串转数字只支持完整的字符串格式和类似NAN/INF这种形式，其他情况会报错， 使整个表达式值变为 null，例如  `1 + '1' = 2`， `1 + '1a' = null`  `1 + 'nan' = nan` 具体细节见代码  `be/src/util/string_parser.hpp`, 但是我们的代码似乎错用了string_parser.hpp， string_parser 的实际行为是和mysql 保持一致的， 只是在parse的状态上有 对于 完全是字符串的情况 会返回一个错误状态码，但是有默认值0返回，相反的对于NAN 和 INF 我们代码却没有对应的处理逻辑，应该返回NULL， 所以这个问题可以看成是doris 对于这种情况的一种错误处理\r\n但是现在 由于doris 有一定的用户量，所以无论是改成 mysql 兼容还是 postgres 兼容 都会引起对现在的已有用户的不兼容现象，因此 这个问题可以暂时保持现状，等待以后在处理， 也可以修复这个错误的处理逻辑，因为对于使用了group by 的用户可能出现错误的结果\r\n\r\nThe reason for this problem is that in the code of be and fe, our arithmetic operation logic for numbers and strings is caused. When performing arithmetic operations on strings and numbers, strings are cast to double by default. Different databases deal with this problem differently. For example, postgres does not support this operation. MySQL supports it. The logic of mysql is to match the string prefix to a number. If the prefix is ​​not a number, it is 0. For example, `1 + '1' = 2` , `1 + '1a' = 2`,` 1 + 'a' = 1`, `1 + 'a1' = 2`, our current code is partially compatible with mysql operations, but string to number support only complete String format and forms like NAN / INF, other cases will report errors, making the entire expression value null, such as `1 + '1' = 2`,` 1 + '1a' = null` `1 + 'nan' = nan` For details, see the code `be / src / util / string_parser.hpp`, but our code seems to use string_parser.hpp incorrectly. The actual behavior of string_parser is consistent with mysql, only in the parse state There is an error status code for a completely string case, but a default value of 0 is returned. In contrast, for NAN and INF, our code has no corresponding processing logic and should return NULL, so this problem can be seen as doris An error handling for this situation\r\nBut now that doris has a certain number of users, whether it is mysql-compatible or postgres-compatible will cause incompatibility to existing users. Therefore, this problem can be temporarily maintained, waiting to be processed later, or you can fix this. Wrong processing logic, because users who use group by may have wrong results","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/561495344/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/561495497","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/issues/2145#issuecomment-561495497","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/2145","id":561495497,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MTQ5NTQ5Nw==","user":{"login":"yangzhg","id":9098473,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwOTg0NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9098473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg","html_url":"https://github.com/yangzhg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-04T06:19:12Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T06:19:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"the same with issue #2142 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/561495497/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/561539438","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/issues/2101#issuecomment-561539438","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/2101","id":561539438,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MTUzOTQzOA==","user":{"login":"EmmyMiao87","id":25147274,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTQ3Mjc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25147274?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EmmyMiao87","html_url":"https://github.com/EmmyMiao87","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EmmyMiao87/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EmmyMiao87/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EmmyMiao87/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EmmyMiao87/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EmmyMiao87/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EmmyMiao87/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EmmyMiao87/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EmmyMiao87/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EmmyMiao87/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-04T08:51:19Z","updated_at":"2019-12-24T09:50:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"# 详细设计\r\n\r\n## 名词解释\r\n1.
