I assume the Scala, JDOM, and W3CDOM don't have these security issues since the XML was parsed into these data structures and so are safe to use. But the XMLTextInfosetInputter and JSON use the woodstox and jackson libraries, respectively. Neither of these use an XMLReader of parse. The XML one is StAX which uses a different API. And the JSON one is custom, but similar to StAX.\r\n\r\nIt looks like the Woodstox StAX properties are defined in three blog posts:\r\nhttps://cowtowncoder.medium.com/configuring-woodstox-xml-parser-basic-stax-properties-39bdf88c18ec\r\nhttps://cowtowncoder.medium.com/configuring-woodstox-xml-parser-stax2-properties-c80ef5a32ef1\r\nhttps://cowtowncoder.medium.com/configuring-woodstox-xml-parser-woodstox-specific-properties-1ce5030a5173\r\n\r\nI think these are the javadocs for what an XMLInputFactory supports:\r\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/xml/stream/XMLInputFactory.html\r\nhttps://fasterxml.github.io/woodstox/javadoc/6.2/com/ctc/wstx/api/WstxInputProperties.html\r\n\r\nDo we need to set something similar for these?

First and third commits indeed address all my comments and the changes look great.  Second commit has a slight problem with test coverage.  Your @Test def testXMLTextInfosetInputterDisallowsDocType() tried several ways to load XML securely with the Woodstox XML library and found the best way was to both turn off features and add a doctype check / throw exception in XMLTextInfosetInputter.scala.  I believe you then got inspired to add a doctype check / throw exception to a similar place in JDOMInfosetInputter.scala but that line doesn't get called by any test either because we either need a new test to check JDOM secure loading or JDOM doesn't let programs see the doctype at all when you enable secure XML loading.  If the latter is the case, It's probably a good idea to keep the check in case of malicious input and just add a comment saying so along with comments to disable codecov.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/848790387/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/853322506","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/583#issuecomment-853322506","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/583","id":853322506,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg1MzMyMjUwNg==","user":{"login":"mbeckerle","id":1524099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1524099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle","html_url":"https://github.com/mbeckerle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-02T19:22:25Z","updated_at":"2021-06-02T19:22:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This stripping of line numbers/file attributes .. moving that over into the processor for IBM DFDL makes sense, because it is its inability to tolerate non-native attributes that is at issue.

For example, we have these lines in the parser section of Main.scala:\r\n```scala\r\n          case Some(proc) if (!proc.isError) => {\r\n            ...\r\n            if (error) 1 else 0\r\n          }\r\n          case Some(processor) => 1\r\n          case None => 1\r\n```\r\nThere are three different places where we return a 1, which potentially means three different error codes. I think the other two cases represent different failures to compile a schema, though I'm not sure specifically what differentiates them.  I\"m also not even sure if they both can be hit. I think if there is a compilation issue, then the CLI outputs diagnostics and then returns None. So I think this wants to be something like:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n          case Some(proc) => {\r\n            Assert.invariant(!proc.isError)\r\n            ...\r\n            if (error) 1 else 0\r\n          }\r\n          case None => 1\r\n```\r\nBut the point is, these 1's probably want to have separate error codes as well. Something like COMPILE_SCHEMA_ERROR_CODE, and one like PARSE_ERROR_CODE.\r\n\r\nAnytime there is a ``1`` in the run function, that's probably an error code that needs to be changed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/864980490/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/865013564","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/592#issuecomment-865013564","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/592","id":865013564,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2NTAxMzU2NA==","user":{"login":"stevedlawrence","id":3180601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODA2MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3180601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence","html_url":"https://github.com/stevedlawrence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-21T13:01:50Z","updated_at":"2021-06-21T13:01:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"In regards to Mike's comment about checking the return code, since integration tests are just run in a shell with expect, you need to echo the return code and then expect the right code.

We should rename \"daffodil\" to \"Apache Daffodil\" so that it will move up the list (a lot of projects start with \"Apache ....\").  We also should move the sonar step to main.yml and run it after all the coverage has been measured so that our metrics will include coverage too.  Finally, we should remove all occurrences of \"incubator\" from our SonarCloud configuration profile since we're no longer an incubating project.  I plan to push another commit which will move the Sonar step into main.yml.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/868019546/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/868432519","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/598#issuecomment-868432519","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/598","id":868432519,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2ODQzMjUxOQ==","user":{"login":"stevedlawrence","id":3180601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODA2MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3180601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence","html_url":"https://github.com/stevedlawrence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-25T11:28:53Z","updated_at":"2021-06-25T11:28:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I thought there was a reason we only enabled sonar scans for pushes and not pull requests?

So I'm not sure it makes a difference.\r\n\r\nI also tested back to back (e.g. `sbt test test`). My thinking was that before this change, compiled schemas would still be cached for the second test, so the second test wouldn't need to compile anything and should be faster than the first. But there really was no difference there either. I'm not sure if maybe there just weren't enough things being cached (I think we only cached file-based schemas before?), or if sbt is doing some magic to clean up and recreate objects inbetween tests, or if schema compilation just isn't the slow part of our test suite. Either way, the global cache didn't seem to help a ton.\r\n\r\nI did run things through a profiler before and after this change and looked at the memory usage. Before this change, sbt had 0.26 GB of used memory before running tests and 0.43 GB after. So ~200MB of cached \"stuff\". After this change, it went from 0.26 GB to .33 GB so about ~100MB of cached \"stuff\". I think there's a lot of stuff other than our schemas, much of with is just Scala stuff. It's pretty surprising to see how many objects scala creates for things like lambdas that can just never be freed. So all in-all, it did save some space, but not a significant amount, and not enough to really make a big difference.\r\n\r\n> Can you run the whole dfdl-schemas 'sbt test' without running out of memory now?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately no. I pretty quickly saw my swap getting used, so I think maybe I just don't have enough free memory on my system for what I've given to SBT. I might need to play around with things a bit.\r\n\r\nThat said, I'm not entirely convinced these leaks are the main culprit (thought it's good to fix).\r\n\r\nOne issue is I think a few schemas still use the DFDLTestSuite are they are never set to null, so those caches will still never be freed. I don't think there's enough that use that to matter.\r\n\r\nI suspect the main issue is that our dfdl-schemas regression is just too parallel happy and tries to do too much at once. Even if we are freeing caches, when we load large tdml files, compiling them all, comparing results, etc. many at the same time, it just requires a lot of memory--we just can't do that much work at once.\r\n\r\nWe might also need to look at what other things the TDML Runner is \"caching\". One example, the document bits is stored as a lazy val in the Document. Even though it's lazy so we won't created until it's needed, once it's created, it's not going to be freed until the entire DFDLTestSuite goes away. We possibly do the same thing for the expected. So I think there's still some thought that needs to be put into what the TDML runner stores as a val, and what it just recreates every time a test is run. This way we only use memory for the life of a test rather than the life of the test suite.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/870608311/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/870668309","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/599#issuecomment-870668309","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/599","id":870668309,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3MDY2ODMwOQ==","user":{"login":"tuxji","id":5915561,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MTU1NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5915561?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuxji","html_url":"https://github.com/tuxji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuxji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuxji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuxji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuxji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuxji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuxji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuxji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuxji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuxji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-29T14:49:50Z","updated_at":"2021-06-29T14:49:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Does it make sense to move Sonarcloud back to it's own file? Our workflow pretty much always uses forks (except for the dependabot things which we can't change) so pull requests are rarely going to run for pull requests.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't really make sense to move Sonar back to sonarcloud.yml.  The Sonar scanner needs to see the fully built source tree and we need to run tests for coverage information anyway, so we do that only once in main.yml and then call the Sonar scanner as an afterthought if appropriate.  We just have to avoid running the Sonar scanner when we don't have secrets.SONAR_TOKEN available.

+1\r\n> \r\n> I didn't have time to review thoroughly, but looks good. What was the reason for changing so many def's to lazy val's, how did that help achieve your goal?\r\n\r\nSo the short answer is that the LVs are always lazy. Implenting these in the \"def\" style creates a ton of smaller data objects stored in a hash table, and that made analyzing the heap dump too hard. Implementing as \"lazy val\" makes each DSOM object bigger, because there are lots of lazy val members that never get evaluated. But the hash table is not there, nor the objects in it. The heap dump is therefore far simpler, as the relationship of one object to another is often just one is a member of the other, vs one is in a hash table entry where that hash table is on the other object Anyway, I was able to dig through and spot the problem, which was actually in the validator holding on to the objects. \r\n\r\nUsing regular lazy vals also helps with regular breakpoint debugging because you can see the values in a standard debugger inspection of the DSOM object, albeit you have to scroll through lots of members of the object most of which are unused. \r\n\r\nA long time back the whole OOLAG LV system used to be all done with lazy val. We switched to def with a hash table to store the LV objects as one attempt to address compilation time and space. \r\n\r\nHowever, that wasn't the primary problem with compilation time. It was copying (vs. sharing) of shared structures that was the biggest issue. Now that this is rectified (since 2.6.0), I prefer to use lazy val for these things because of the improved debug, and the simplification of the heap-dump analysis pushed me over the threshold where I decided to change them all back to just using lazy val.

62ac1047a18979bea1f5d6c668eefeaaae39d64b changed the parameters to the `DaffodilXMLLoader.load` method, which is where the problem is on the line\r\n```scala\r\nval node = loader.load(URISchemaSource(configOpt.get))\r\n```\r\nThat line should look like this now:\r\n```scala\r\nval node = loader.load(URISchemaSource(configOpt.get), Some(XMLUtils.dafextURI))\r\n```\r\nWhich means that your `TunableGenerator.scala` file is old and isn't updated for some reason, but your `DaffodilXMLLoader.scala` file is the new correct one. Maybe you need to refresh files in your IDE or something? If you're still not sure, feel free to commit your changes and push to this PR and I can take a look and see whats going on.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/875581937/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/875613507","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/603#issuecomment-875613507","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/603","id":875613507,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3NTYxMzUwNw==","user":{"login":"Samarth08","id":17105953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MTA1OTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17105953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samarth08","html_url":"https://github.com/Samarth08","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samarth08/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samarth08/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samarth08/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samarth08/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samarth08/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samarth08/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samarth08/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samarth08/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samarth08/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-07T13:40:15Z","updated_at":"2021-07-07T13:40:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I have fetched the latest master but I am not able to run the tests.I am not able to test bitNot.Rest all are tested.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/875613507/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/875811125","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/603#issuecomment-875811125","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/603","id":875811125,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3NTgxMTEyNQ==","user":{"login":"stevedlawrence","id":3180601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODA2MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3180601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence","html_url":"https://github.com/stevedlawrence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-07T17:58:30Z","updated_at":"2021-07-07T17:58:30Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Based on what you've pushed, I'm not sure why you would get the error about ``loader.load``.

In the future, avoid running `git merge` or `git pull` (which does a merge behind the scenes), since they lead to these merge commits that cause issues. Lots of places online say to use git pull or git merge, but for Daffodil those commands should be avoided.\r\n\r\nHere's the commands to fix your branch up and squash into a single commit:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# make sure we are on your branch\r\ngit checkout DAFFODIL-2473_Remaining\r\n\r\n# create a backup branch just in case we mess things up\r\ngit branch DAFFODIL-2473-backup\r\n\r\n# create a diff between your branch and master\r\ngit diff asf/master > daffodil-2473.patch\r\n\r\n# move your branch to asf/master\r\ngit reset --hard asf/master\r\n\r\n# apply the patch and stage the changes\r\ngit apply --index daffodil-2473.patch\r\n\r\n# delete the patch file\r\nrm daffodil-2473.patch\r\n\r\n# commit your changes, add a new commit message\r\ngit commit\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf that all works, you should now have a single commit containing your squashed changes on top of asf/master.

And the failures are all with the error:\r\n```scala\r\njava.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: \"%errorlevel%\"\r\n```\r\nSo it seems our new expectExitCode capture our echo line, and not the results. Looking at the output for the integration tests, we see things like this:\r\n```\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\r\n<never-fails>2f6481e6-542c-11eb-ae93-0242ac130002</never-fails>\r\necho EXITCODE:%errorlevel%\r\n\r\nD:\\a\\daffodil\\daffodil>echo EXITCODE:%errorlevel%\r\nEXITCODE:0\r\n```\r\nSo we can see some output happened (the never-fails stuff), and before we got a prompt we call sendLine with `echo EXITCODE:%errorlevel%`, which we can see (that's output to the console). Then we will call `expect(\"EXITCODE\")`. But even though echo command has already been output, windows will output it again, and we are going to match that. I guess Linux doesn't output that stuff twice. \r\n\r\nSo as to a solution? I wonder if rather than expecting `EXITCODE:`, we can instead look for `\\nEXITCODE', with a prepended newline? That way we won't match the keyword in the echo because there's a space before that keyword? Which would mean the expect line becomes this:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nshell.expect(contains(\"\\n\" + keyWord))\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/887477300/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/887500297","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/601#issuecomment-887500297","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/601","id":887500297,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhBG1s405i4J","user":{"login":"tuxji","id":5915561,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MTU1NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5915561?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuxji","html_url":"https://github.com/tuxji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuxji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuxji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuxji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuxji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuxji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuxji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuxji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuxji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuxji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-27T13:12:06Z","updated_at":"2021-07-27T13:12:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> If we can get the CI to run, I am ok with the changes here.\r\n> \r\n> I don't know why it doesn't run any more on each push of a new commit.\r\n\r\nGitHub changed its CI policy two or three months ago because miners were spamming repos with one-off pull requests.

If we look at the output of a failing test, we see something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n echo '<tns:e1 xmlns:tns=\"http://example.com\">Hello</tns:e1>' | .\\daffodil-cli\\target\\universal\\stage\\bin\\daffodil.bat unparse -s .\\daffodil-test\\src\\test\\resources\\org\\apache\\daffodil\\section00\\general\\generalSchema.dfdl.xsd --root e1 -\r\nD:\\a\\daffodil\\daffodil>echo '<tns:e1 xmlns:tns=\"http://example.com\">Hello</tns:e1>' | .\\daffodil-cli\\target\\universal\\stage\\bin\\daffodil.bat unparse -s .\\daffodil-test\\src\\test\\resources\\org\\apache\\daffodil\\section00\\general\\generalSchema.dfdl.xsd --root e1 -\r\necho EXITCODE:^|%errorlevel%\r\nThe system cannot find the file specified.\r\nError:  Unparse Error: Illegal content where start or end event expected: Error: Unexpected EOF in prolog\r\n at [row,col {unknown-source}]: [1,0] on line 1\r\nSchema context: element reference tns:e1 Location line 19 in file:/D:/a/daffodil/daffodil/./daffodil-test/src/test/resources/org/apache/daffodil/section00/general/generalSchema.dfdl.xsd\r\n\r\nD:\\a\\daffodil\\daffodil>echo EXITCODE:^|%errorlevel%\r\nEXITCODE:|21\r\n```\r\n\r\nI *think* this is the output for test_3529_CLI_Unparsing_SimpleUnparse_stdin3. This test runs the unparse command and then expects the output \"Hello\". I think this test passed previously for a similar reason that we just had to fix the expect exit code stuff: We are running a command, windows is outputting that command, and then we are matching the output. So when we `expect` \"Hello\", it's actually finding the `Hello` in the command, and not in the unparsed data. So these tests are just plain broken and we didn't know it.\r\n\r\nSo there are two issues:\r\n1. Why are these tests failing on windows\r\n2. Is there a way to ensure we aren't matching the command, and are instead matching the actual unparsed data.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing that the answer to 1 is because these tests are using single quotes to escape the XML infoset. But single quotes don't do anything on windows--only double quotes escape things. So since the infoset isn't being escaped properly, windows see's the angle brackets as file redirection (hence \"The system cannot find the file specified.\" error). We use single quotes in these tests because the infoset already includes double quotes in the XML. But I think an easy solution here is to just swap single quotes and double quotes for these tests that fail, so the command would look like this:\r\n```scala\r\nval cmd = String.format(\"\"\"echo \"<tns:e1 xmlns:tns='http://example.com'>Hello</tns:e1>\" | %s ... \"\"\")\r\n```\r\nSo the double quotes escape things correctly, and we use single quotes inside the XML, which is still valid XML.\r\n\r\nFor issue 2, I think we probably need to make it so what we unparse is different from the content in the infoset. So if we try to unaprse an infoset containing the string \"Hello\" the result can't also be \"Hello\" or expect won't know the difference. One way to make sure there is a diffrence is to add an initiator to the schea element. So for example, if our schema looks like this:\r\n```xml\r\n<element name=\"e1\" dfdl:lengthKind=\"explicit\" dfdl:length=\"5\" type=\"xs:string\" />\r\n```\r\nWe can change it to this instead:\r\n```xml\r\n<element name=\"e1\" dfdl:initiator=\"init:\" dfdl:lengthKind=\"explicit\" dfdl:length=\"5\" type=\"xs:string\" />\r\n```\r\nThis way if our infoset looks like this:\r\n```xml\r\n<tns:e1 xmlns:tns=\"http://example.com\">Hello</tns:e1>\r\n```\r\nIt will unparse to `init:Hello` rather than just \"Hello\". And then we can `expect` the full `init:Hello` and be confident that we're expecting the unparsed data rather than the infoset data. This does mean that test inputs and outputs need to change. Parsed data needs to look like \"init:foo\" and unparsed data needs to expect \"init:foo\"--the XML infoset stays the same though. \r\n\r\nAn alternative might just to find a way to prevent windows from printing the command to stdout, but I'm not familiar enough with windows to know if that's possible.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/887884786/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/895406726","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/603#issuecomment-895406726","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/603","id":895406726,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhBG1s41XtKG","user":{"login":"stevedlawrence","id":3180601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODA2MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3180601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence","html_url":"https://github.com/stevedlawrence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-09T17:31:35Z","updated_at":"2021-08-09T17:31:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Looks good!

A comment I came across implies that the expected behavior is that if a global element is not referenced anywhere, then we should treat it as if it could be a root, and thus if it has any expressions that reach past that potential root then it is an error. If an element is referenced, then we don't place the same restrictions, and we allow things like expressions that go past the local root.\r\n\r\nMy guess (though not confirmed) is that the json schema where this bug was discovered has a unused global group defintion that contain elements with expression that went outside of that group def. And since the group wasn't used anywhere, we treated it like a potential root element (even though it's inside a group) and didn't allow those expressions. \r\n\r\nThougg, one could argue that this isn't correct, and we shouldn't assume an element could be a root until it's actually used as a root. This change seems to have that behavior.

That variety of root elements is usually about testing. E.g., for a messaging data format, it is very common to have a top-level element that is for a single messsage, as well as a top-level element for an unbounded vector of such elements, so that one can test the schema easily against individual messages (e.g., in a TDML file) or against files containing multiple messages. Top level elements for testing the major components of a message in isolation are also common.\r\n\r\nIt saves schema compilation time if parsers/unparsers are created for ALL such top level elements, particularly, if they share sub-parser/unparsers. This can be substantial time savings for a large DFDL schema during the dev/test/debug cycle. \r\n\r\nThis need to have many available root elements for testing purposes is why I do NOT like the solution of putting a property on the DFDL schema declaring the specific unique root element. But I would not be opposed to such a property labeling each of all possible root elements, thereby allowing global element decls that are NOT intended to be root elements to be distinguished from those intended to be root elements. (Another way to do this would be to have a single top-level DFDL annotation that declares the QNames of all allowed root elements. We'd still need to gather these from all schema files however.)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/903835862/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/904558654","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/626#issuecomment-904558654","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/626","id":904558654,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhBG1s416ng-","user":{"login":"stevedlawrence","id":3180601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODA2MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3180601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence","html_url":"https://github.com/stevedlawrence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-24T11:32:10Z","updated_at":"2021-08-24T11:32:10Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":" +1\r\n   \r\n - [X] **Do all automated continuous integration checks pass?**\r\n Yes\r\n- [X] **Is the update a patch, minor, or major update?**\r\n Minor update, just adds caching support for maven and gradle, which don't apply to our sbt-base build\r\n - [X] **Is the license still compatible with ASF License Policy?**\r\n Yes, still MIT.\r\n - [X] **Have any changes been made to LICENSE/NOTICE files that need to be incorporated?**\r\n No changes\r\n - [X] **Have any transitive dependencies been added or changed?**\r\n Not applicable","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/904558654/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/904569744","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/625#issuecomment-904569744","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/625","id":904569744,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhBG1s416qOQ","user":{"login":"stevedlawrence","id":3180601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODA2MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3180601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence","html_url":"https://github.com/stevedlawrence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-24T11:51:08Z","updated_at":"2021-08-24T11:51:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Is it even possible to take advantage of that right now though? For example, if you wanted to get the parser for two root elements in the same schema wouldn't you need to do something like this:\r\n```scala\r\nval pf1 = Compiler.compile(\"schema.dfdl.xsd\", \"root1\")\r\nval dp1 = pf1.onPath(\"/\")\r\nval pf2 = Compiler.compile(\"schema.dfdl.xsd\", \"root2\")\r\nval dp2 = pf1.onPath(\"/\")\r\n```\r\nIsn't this going to compile the schema (and all possible root elements) twice, essentially doubling the work? I do get the point about validating everything, so I think this is reasonable behavior, but I'm not sure it saves schema compilation time. If anything wouldn't it make things worse? At least until we support onPath parameters other than root? I guess ideally we would have this, which probably would be pretty efficient:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval pf1 = Compiler.compile(\"schema.dfdl.xsd\")\r\nval dp1 = pf1.onPath(\"/root1\")\r\nval dp2 = pf1.onPath(\"/root2\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, the more I think about this change, I think it's the right change to have (the OVC expression really doesn't belong on and ERD). But I think maybe we have a bug somewhere else if the expected behavior is for these expressions on \"possible\" roots should cause an error. For example, inputValueCalc expressions on possible roots don't cause an error, and I didn't change anything related to those. I think previously we just got lucky in that we were forcing ERDs to be created, which forced the OVC to be compiled. So really, we only validated OVC expression on possible roots, and no other expressions.\r\n\r\nSo if we do want these expressions to cause an error, we likely need some other fix. I think it's still maybe worth merging this change, as it allows these schemas to compile?
