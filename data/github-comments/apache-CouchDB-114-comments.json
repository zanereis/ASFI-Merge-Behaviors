the reason is likely because of how the default channels were disabled by removing them from the config. As of 3.3 those channel are always present (to allow adding new default system channel to the list). If you don't want the them to be active, you may set their `concurrency` to 0 as a better way to disable them. But removing from the config list doesn't work a disabling mechanism any longer.\r\n\r\nSo you could try doing:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[smoosh.$channel]\r\nconcurrency = 0\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere `$channel` could be one of `upgrade_dbs, ratio_dbs,slack_dbs, upgrade_views, ratio_views, slack_views, index_cleanup` + other custom channels you may have.\r\n\r\nAnother reason, I which may affect you is the change in the size calculation. Previously the document bodies which would have been deleted during compaction would have counted for the active size calculation. That is no longer the case. See the commit https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/4264 for more details. You may have to adjust your ratio value if it was previously set too low accounting for how the active size was erroneously inflated.

If replication IDs change, that means previous checkpoints won't be found, and replication will rewind from 0. Now, if your source, target and other replication parameters stay the same it's most like the the server uuid `[couchdb] uuid = ...` value that's not consistent. The setting is described [here](https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/config/couchdb.html#couchdb/uuid)\r\n\r\nHere is the description on the replication ID generation algorithm: https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/replication/protocol.html#generate-replication-id\r\n\r\nIf that is not specified, a random value will be generated, and that would cause your replications IDs to be random every time if you spin up docker containers unless you persist your config or explicitly set `[couchdb] uuid ...`.\r\n\r\nThat value doesn't have to be a proper UUID. You could use a hostname or some other identifier that uniquely identifies the same \"cluster\". In addition, make sure it's set to the same value on all the nodes in the cluster. If you have 3 nodes (couch1, couch2, couch3 ensure uuid is the same).\r\n\r\nCheckpoints are persisted on both source and target endpoints (database) in `_local/$base_replication_id` docs. Replications will only resume from a checkpoint if it can find the checkpoint  on *both* source and target. So in your logs you could monitor for those 404s and hopefully finally it should find the last one is found (a 200 response). There are usually a few 404s expected as we try to load older versions of replication ID since the algorithm to generate has evolved at least 4 times. Then monitor if replication ID values stay the same or change.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/1397565505/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/1398211068","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/4385#issuecomment-1398211068","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/4385","id":1398211068,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmUc5TVwH8","user":{"login":"tophe","id":55964,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1OTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55964?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tophe","html_url":"https://github.com/tophe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tophe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tophe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tophe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tophe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tophe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tophe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tophe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tophe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tophe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-20T10:47:28Z","updated_at":"2023-01-20T10:47:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"hi, \r\n\r\nsorry for the local.ini, if you have get it, you should see that I haven't set the uuid, as you guessed.\r\nI set it on each cluster, and restart.

We've even discussed it 7 years or so ago :-)\r\n\r\nhttps://lists.apache.org/thread/kvvjodld2ly0t9rrllfd4d27pwf43hy5\r\n\r\nMy comment from 2016 was:\r\n\r\n> There has been a surprising resurgence of compression research lately with things like Brotli from Google and zstd from Facebook (http://facebook.github.io/zstd/). zstd has an interesting \"training\" mode where it can do a pass over small documents and learn a common dictionary, and CouchDB already passed over data during compaction, would that be a good time to train a compression dictionary?\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the time it wasn't sure how zstd would do, but it seems to have survived pretty well and even made its way into the Linux kernel.\r\n\r\nThat being said, if we just do the naive compression of doc bodies like we do now, it might not be worth it as there is a real future backward compatibility cost having to support another compression scheme essentially forever. It's kind of like that with snappy already. Now, one motivating factor about zstd would be if we could apply per-btree or per db compression using a dictionary. CouchDB's compaction provides a nice place to learn the dictionary and update during each compaction cycle.\r\n\r\n> CouchDB already supports multiple compression codecs (by the way, which exactly?\r\n\r\nThe current compression methods include snappy and the built-in Erlang term compression. See the [docs](https://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/config/couchdb.html#couchdb/file_compression) for more details. The built-in Erlang compression is essentially deflate with 10 configurable levels.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/1399405229/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/1401511199","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/4401#issuecomment-1401511199","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/4401","id":1401511199,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmUc5TiV0f","user":{"login":"big-r81","id":9985963,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5ODU5NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9985963?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-r81","html_url":"https://github.com/big-r81","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-r81/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-r81/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-r81/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-r81/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-r81/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-r81/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-r81/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-r81/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-r81/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-24T07:53:43Z","updated_at":"2023-01-24T07:53:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi,\r\n\r\nseeing

Elixir worked great for integration tests moving from Javascript to Elixir, and we got a lot of help from contributors there, but there just wasn't much interest in translating Erlang eunit tests to Elixir.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime EUnit tests have improved quite a bit: we have maps, so asserts matching on response shapes is more ergonomic, the TDEF/TDEF_FE macros make test suite nice to look at, we get better coverage reports, which helps immensely identifying areas we completely missed.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/1411441047/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/1413453777","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/4409#issuecomment-1413453777","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/4409","id":1413453777,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmUc5UP5fR","user":{"login":"pgj","id":277835,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NzgzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/277835?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj","html_url":"https://github.com/pgj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-02T09:57:03Z","updated_at":"2023-02-02T09:57:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing
