This mostly happens when there is an issue with selenium logging into the UX.

I ran into this often while testing. Moving to postgres / mysql helped me.\r\n\r\nAny trace from the webserver will help me debug the problem.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/422608332/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/422608599","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/5294#issuecomment-422608599","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/5294","id":422608599,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMjYwODU5OQ==","user":{"login":"mahendra","id":115988,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTk4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/115988?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahendra","html_url":"https://github.com/mahendra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahendra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahendra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahendra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahendra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahendra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahendra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahendra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahendra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahendra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-19T00:53:24Z","updated_at":"2018-09-19T00:53:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@villebro just noticed that we have added `cypress` based testing (and it is failing on my branch).

Superset frontend is ajax-heavy. For the long term, when we develop some new features (like improve logging or batch-fetch etc, maybe?), I need to consider should i add this additional function in Superset or in the toolkit code base? <br/>When we need a little change on FAB, I need to fix it in another codebase, tested it in another codebase with many context i am not familiar, wait it build and generate a new version, then i can use it in Superset. This toolkit will be much more friendly than FAB, but the repo is different :)\r\n\r\n- Is it possible that make the new toolkit inside Superset, but generate standalone modules, to share with embeddable chart? \r\n\r\nI guess all above are somewhat discussed in the meeting. If all of our major contributors (especially frontend contributors) accept inconvenience, i can accept it too :)\r\n\r\n@mistercrunch @betodealmeida @hughhhh @xtinec @JamshedRahman @jeffreythewang @fabianmenges @michellethomas @williaster @kristw @conglei ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/422928030/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/422933278","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/5875#issuecomment-422933278","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/5875","id":422933278,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMjkzMzI3OA==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-19T19:42:37Z","updated_at":"2018-10-15T23:20:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/5875?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#5875](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/5875?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/commit/9029701f2426f3be62da071c499874b7e68f0b84?src=pr&el=desc) will **not change** coverage.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/5875/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=KsB0fHcx6l&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/5875?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@           Coverage Diff           @@\n##           master    #5875   +/-   ##\n=======================================\n  Coverage   77.28%   77.28%           \n=======================================\n  Files          47       47           \n  Lines        9332     9332           \n=======================================\n  Hits         7212     7212           \n  Misses       2120     2120\n```\n\n\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/5875?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/5875?src=pr&el=footer).

This may be solvable without editing the NVD3. \r\n- Generate the x-series based on time duration and grain. If range is Jan 1 - Jan 3 with daily granularity, then generate `[Jan 1, Jan 2, Jan 3]`.\r\n- Left join generated series into data set. This would generate `{Jan 1: 10, Jan 2: None, Jan 3: 7}`. Each metric would need to be left-joined into the source series.\r\n- When drawn, lines should then skip over missing points.\r\n\r\nThis logic should work for time series graphs. Jan 2 occurs between Jan 1 and Jan 3, regardless of if any data is in the returned set. The approach would not work for arbitrary dimensions as Superset does not have knowledge of the set of values. Furthermore, this would mean that the first x-axis bounds would be determined by the date range and not the returned set.\r\n\r\nIn response to approaches:\r\n- null to be replaced by 0: This does feel like a hack that alters the underlying data.\r\n\r\n- lines in line chat to be broken off, show a line on the left, and a line on the right: I agree with @davidhassan that this is probably the best solution. It accurately visualizes the returned data.\r\n\r\n- lines to skip over missing points, connecting the dots on either side: This seems like the worst option as the visual is out of sync with the underlying data (more so than replacing with 0s, in my opinion, as 0 is \"closer\" to null than other values).\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/422967997/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/422973552","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/5888#issuecomment-422973552","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/5888","id":422973552,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMjk3MzU1Mg==","user":{"login":"aaronbannin","id":6948336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDgzMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6948336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronbannin","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronbannin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronbannin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronbannin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronbannin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronbannin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronbannin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronbannin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronbannin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronbannin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronbannin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-19T22:01:49Z","updated_at":"2018-09-19T22:01:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Some examples:\r\n\r\nLine chart with disconnected lines for null values.

Your comments and review were very good I am very glad to have your help and commitment in maintaining this code. Since my organization (still) uses superset, I am ready to commit to maintaining it too. I also plan to build out a BI team in the next 18 months within my data infrastructure team, which will have a mandate of maintaining / improving superset. As of now, I just lost one big set of users to Looker, but I still have our entire engineering org using superset.\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, I am open to any comments, but it would be great to have some assurance for an end to this PR (accept or reject). Also, I am in the blind as to who the maintainers are and what the process is for getting my PR merged. I had to go through git history to ping the first reviewer. After that, it has been guess work. Not knowing the maintainers did not allow me to prioritize feature requests and code changes. This does dampen a contributor's enthusiasm. To give an example, I stopped working on other significant features in superset, because of delays in this PR. (dashboard / slice organization and hierarchical menus, better metadata etc.). They are sitting as local branches, but I am kinda scared of sending PRs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/423434530/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/423462645","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/3972#issuecomment-423462645","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/3972","id":423462645,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMzQ2MjY0NQ==","user":{"login":"tomsej","id":6624716,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MjQ3MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6624716?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomsej","html_url":"https://github.com/tomsej","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomsej/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomsej/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomsej/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomsej/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomsej/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomsej/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomsej/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomsej/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomsej/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-21T08:51:33Z","updated_at":"2018-09-21T08:51:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Any progress on this issue @alanmcruickshank?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/423462645/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/423503123","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/5941#issuecomment-423503123","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/5941","id":423503123,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMzUwMzEyMw==","user":{"login":"algorri94","id":14870931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODcwOTMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14870931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/algorri94","html_url":"https://github.com/algorri94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/algorri94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/algorri94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/algorri94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/algorri94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/algorri94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/algorri94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/algorri94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/algorri94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/algorri94/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-21T11:40:25Z","updated_at":"2018-09-21T11:40:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Yes!

This is one step toward completely removing `jQuery` altogether, which is used in other places for DOM manipulation and possibly `react-bootstrap`. This is a large enough task that doing it in chunks is probably the best way forward.\r\n\r\n> When we need a little change on FAB, I need to fix it in another codebase, tested it in another codebase with many context i am not familiar, wait it build and generate a new version, then i can use it in Superset. Is it possible that make the new toolkit inside Superset, but generate standalone modules, to share with embeddable chart?\r\n\r\nCouple thoughts\r\n- [Above](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/5667#issue-351761915) I enumerated some pros/cons of whether `@superset-ui` packages should live within this repo, or a separate one. The Pros of moving it to a separate repo seemed to outweigh the cons, so we are moving forward with the [separate `superset-ui` repo](https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui).\r\n\r\n- While you're right that it may add some additional overhead to address an issue or develop a feature for `superset` in the separate `superset-ui` repo, this can be largely addressed using `npm link` which simply sym-links package `@superset-ui/xxx` in `node_modules` to your local `@superset-ui/xxx` dev repo. \r\n\r\n> For the long term, when we develop some new features (like improve logging or batch-fetch etc, maybe?), I need to consider should i add this additional function in Superset or in the toolkit code base? \r\n\r\nWe discussed this in person a bit. To start we'll play it by ear, if something would be useful in another repository, we could make it into a package.

I was talking more about how the query is generated in Superet, not what is valid SQL syntax. I believe that in this instance putting quotes around `{col}` for Postgres is probably the simplest solution, but I would not apply the same to all other engine types.\r\n\r\nLong answer: I was referring to how Superset generates SQL queries. Currently most other parts of the query are generated using SQL Alchemy constructs that automatically detect the need for quotes. For example, selecting a column `ColumnName` with an alias `col_alias` is in fact roughly defined as \r\n`column('ColumnName').label('col_alias')`, which is then compiled into `SELECT \"ColumnName\" AS col_alias`. If either require quoting, `ColumnName` in this example, SQL Alchemy automatically puts quotes around it.\r\n\r\nThe problem here is that time grain expressions don't contain a reference to a SQL Alchemy column object, but are static strings inside a `literal_column` object, which makes it impossible for SQL Alchemy to apply conditional quoting.
