Here are the dependencies introduced now:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n[INFO] +- io.grpc:grpc-netty-shaded:jar:1.17.1:runtime\r\n[INFO] |  \\- io.grpc:grpc-core:jar:1.17.1:compile (version selected from constraint [1.17.1,1.17.1])\r\n[INFO] |     +- io.grpc:grpc-context:jar:1.17.1:compile\r\n[INFO] |     +- com.google.code.gson:gson:jar:2.7:compile\r\n[INFO] |     +- com.google.errorprone:error_prone_annotations:jar:2.2.0:compile\r\n[INFO] |     +- com.google.code.findbugs:jsr305:jar:3.0.2:compile\r\n[INFO] |     +- org.codehaus.mojo:animal-sniffer-annotations:jar:1.17:compile\r\n[INFO] |     +- com.google.guava:guava:jar:26.0-android:compile\r\n[INFO] |     |  +- org.checkerframework:checker-compat-qual:jar:2.5.2:compile\r\n[INFO] |     |  \\- com.google.j2objc:j2objc-annotations:jar:1.1:compile\r\n[INFO] |     +- io.opencensus:opencensus-api:jar:0.17.0:compile\r\n[INFO] |     \\- io.opencensus:opencensus-contrib-grpc-metrics:jar:0.17.0:compile\r\n[INFO] +- io.grpc:grpc-stub:jar:1.17.1:compile\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo this ends up being much less of a dependency burden than `armeria` - no netty, protobufs - with the downside of having the collector run on a different port. We can keep this version of gRPC in sync with the version that is being used by `zipkin-gcp` to avoid any issues.\r\n\r\nHowever, `armeria` does have the advantage of everything being on the same port and it would support gRPC-Web out of the box without a proxy. Would switching to `armeria` mean that it would eliminate `undertow` and just use it for everything? If so, we shoud probably find a path to finalizing the gRPC API in this PR and moving forward with this experimental version on a different port. A separate issue could be opened for moving to `armeria` - given the size of that change, I would want to make sure there was plenty of support for it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/447682189/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/447688076","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/2328#issuecomment-447688076","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2328","id":447688076,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NzY4ODA3Ng==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-16T23:51:32Z","updated_at":"2018-12-16T23:51:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"yes armeria would imply geting rid of undertow and its deps. undertow was\nonly added for better perf.\n\nplan sounds fine, but I'm really not keen merging another port to expose.\nmeaning if helpful for development can separate, but please don't release\nus needing to support a second http port perpetually unless the change to\nundo that immediately follows.\n\nOn Mon, Dec 17, 2018 at 6:28 AM Eric Hauser <notifications@github.com>\nwrote:\n\n> So, @anuraaga <https://github.com/anuraaga>'s trick doesn't work - at\n> least with gRPC Java.

We do have a lot of\ncontrol over the server and extensions of it as we explicitly give\nzero warranty on custom builds.

This was done for reasons including that some spans are so small that sending in a single message is wasteful. Also, often people mistakenly assume that sending one span onto a transport is protecting the app from overhead when usually even kafka clients can (and have) crashed an app enqueueing.\r\n\r\nI wonder if we can decouple this completely as having two supported ways to do grpc seems tech debt creating not just here but the inevitable \"it is streaming on server, so why not also in X (where X is every client library)\". I really hesitate strongly about adding more complexity especially in the initial impl as there's already quite a lot of work to do just for unary.\r\n\r\nAssuming unary is in, it would seem possible for someone who felt strongly about streaming to add a module to their setup that is a streaming alternate as well.. meaning we can completely defer this whole thing as well the impact discussions which now only stall the work entirely. What I mean is bundling the option for streaming means supporting it and has almost the same impact as supporting it enabled by default. I don't quite feel we should add that burden today considering we still have a lot of other things to do to get this in.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/450602427/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/450607052","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/2325#issuecomment-450607052","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2325","id":450607052,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MDYwNzA1Mg==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-31T04:26:48Z","updated_at":"2018-12-31T04:26:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"actually no problem I will help","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/450607052/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/450608996","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/2328#issuecomment-450608996","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2328","id":450608996,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MDYwODk5Ng==","user":{"login":"anuraaga","id":198344,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5ODM0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/198344?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga","html_url":"https://github.com/anuraaga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-31T05:10:26Z","updated_at":"2018-12-31T05:10:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yeah just going unary seems fine.
