A few major questions, after doing another pass of review:\n1. Right now Beam interpreter uses **Beam version 0.1.0-incubating**, but didn't Beam project release 0.2.0-incubating on 2016-08-09? Do you think it would be useful to update it right here, before the merge or do you plan to do that in a separate PR later on?\n2. AFAIK there are multiple \"runners\" for Beam, and right only be reading the doc you can see how to switch them. Do you think it would fit Zeppelin use case better if there are 3 different interpreters `%beam.flink`, `%beam.spark`, etc each with it's own appropriate configuration options and a user could just skip creating a class and defining `main() {}` in every paragraph?\n3. Here is the list of dependencies from `mvn dependency:tree`. All of them will become part of the convenience binary for the next Zeppelin release. What is needed to be done, as with any other sub-module or interpreter, in order for us to merge it is: \n   - make sure that ALL these dependencies \n   - and ALL their transitive dependencies \n   - have an appropriate licence, and are logged under the `./zeppelin-distribution/src/bin_license/LICENSE`\n   - and for non-Apache license, full text of the license need to be added to ./zeppelin-distribution/src/license/<dependency-name>`\n   \n   For your convenience I have listed all current dependencies of `beam` module below, please feel free to verify and mark those that satisfy the above criterias.\n- [ ] org.apache.zeppelin:zeppelin-beam:jar:0.7.0-SNAPSHOT\n- [ ] +- org.apache.spark:spark-core_2.10:jar:1.4.1:compile\n- [ ] |  +- com.twitter:chill_2.10:jar:0.5.0:compile\n- [ ] |  |  -

But that is pretty hard. There are several types of interpreters (Sql, Spark, AngularJS, Shell etc..) in the back end and create a unified interface for all of them needs a ton of work. \nA simple example is: if user submits a SQL query and in that query the user applies DATE function to a string field to make that column as type date then basically I do not think we can correctly get the type of the column.\n\nTo me, (again) the data type in front end table is just a utility for the user sorts/formats the data on-the-fly. Does this make more sense?\n\nIn the latest commit I added the date cell detection. Also, I make the detection at the time when data was loaded to the table and this would save some time (each cell will be processed and loaded anyway, see function $scope.loadTableData). I tried to follow the code convention to make the change as API but the current code seems do not like doing like that so I keep my changes with other parts of code that deals with table display. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/243609882/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/243617058","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1371#issuecomment-243617058","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1371","id":243617058,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MzYxNzA1OA==","user":{"login":"Peilin-Yang","id":3334391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzQzOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3334391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peilin-Yang","html_url":"https://github.com/Peilin-Yang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peilin-Yang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peilin-Yang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peilin-Yang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peilin-Yang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peilin-Yang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peilin-Yang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peilin-Yang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peilin-Yang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peilin-Yang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-30T23:48:50Z","updated_at":"2016-08-30T23:48:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"BTW, for the dates detection I made a pre-defined list of supported formats and used the strict mode for moment.js parsing.
