During debugging I find something confusing that is when zipkin server started and connected es failed, then i restart one pod of es cluster node, zipkin server would work again, LoggingClient logs ES_HOSTS not UNKNOWN, but if i restart zipkin server this issue will come again.\r\n> \r\n> I find that might be alpine base image network issues on kubernetes. I have repackage zipkin image with eclipse-temurin ubuntu base image, and it works. I find that more and more libraries running on jvm alpine base image that will have network issues since kubernetes 1.24-1.25 (1.24 in last comment), some components like spring config server, spring config client, some libraries like spring resttemplate, jgit. In my team, since kubernetes being upgraded, almost all projects need to be repackaged from alpine base to non-alpine. So, does the openzipkin team consider providing non-alpine base image as an option?\r\n\r\nCloud you share your build image with non-alpine?  tks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/1309833400/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/1310037767","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2798#issuecomment-1310037767","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2798","id":1310037767,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAEXUMc5OFZcH","user":{"login":"sebastianhaberey","id":4152849,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNTI4NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4152849?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianhaberey","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianhaberey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianhaberey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianhaberey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianhaberey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianhaberey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianhaberey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianhaberey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianhaberey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianhaberey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianhaberey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-10T09:59:10Z","updated_at":"2022-11-10T09:59:10Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Just reporting in to say that I fell for this today.

Please let me\n> know if a more detailed documentation exists, for example, is there any\n> screenshot somewhere showing what is the expected display when setting the\n> property \"zipkin.ui.environment\"?\n>\n> I'm asking this because I've been trying properties that seem to have no\n> effect but I'm not 100% sure since it might just be a poor understanding on\n> my side of how it's supposed to work.\n>\n> Here's my docker-compose configuration for Zipkin:\n>\n>   zipkin:\n>\n>     image: openzipkin/zipkin:2.24.0\n>\n>     ports:\n>\n>       - \"9411:9411\"\n>\n>     environment:\n>\n>       ZIPKIN_UI_ENVIRONMENT: \"test\"\n>\n>       ZIPKIN_UI_SEARCH-ENABLED: \"false\"\n>\n>       ZIPKIN_UI_DEPENDENCY_ENABLED: \"false\"\n>\n>       ZIPKIN_UI_SUPPORT-URL: \"http://yahoo.com\"\n>\n>\n>\n>    - ZIPKIN_UI_ENVIRONMENT --> no visible effect on the UI. \"test\" does\n>    not appear anywhere.\n>    - ZIPKIN_UI_SEARCH-ENABLED --> switching between \"false\" and \"true\"\n>    values does not seem to have any effect on the UI.\n>    - ZIPKIN_UI_DEPENDENCY_ENABLED --> seems to work (it shows/hides the\n>    dependencies menu if you clear the cache).\n>    - ZIPKIN_UI_SUPPORT-URL --> seems to work (adds a question mark button\n>    à top right corner pointing to the configured link)\n>\n> So it seems at least the 2 first properties have no effect. Or maybe I\n> just don't understand how they work.

There weren't any tests for the rest of the Trace details view so was reluctant to be the first. :) \r\n\r\n@basvanbeek Thanks for comments.  \r\n\r\n> * A missing root span (or even an entire upper segment of a trace) should be made visible in the UI. This solution simply reroots without showing there is missing data\r\n\r\nI'm trying to replicate what happened in 2.23 when a parent span is missing. Here's a screenshot of the same trace data in 2.23.\r\n<img width=\"866\" alt=\"correct-2 23\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/192652/215644604-38519edb-f7e8-4a31-924b-6bb1fb669c7a.png\">\r\n\r\nThe 2.23 handling of a missing parent is consistent with other tracing visualizations I've seen. There are many reasons for the root to be missing. In this case the client application framework (ASP.NET) creates a trace context which is being picked up an SDK (Dapr SDK) and forwarded as part of the request to the service. The client application does not emit any spans to ZipKin and there is no expectation from the developer that trace spans would show up. \r\n\r\n> * this rerooting only works if the span to reroot to is the only child of this parent and this span is the only one missing its parent. In case of siblings this would not work or even worse, give a wrong presentation, same with multiple spans missing their parents.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to figure out how the parentId lookup would have different results for two siblings. If the parent span exists, neither sibling would be considered a root, they'd both be childs of the parent span. If the parent span is missing, then both siblings would end up in the roots list. \r\n\r\nTo add \"missing\" spans and mark them in the UI feels like a feature enhancement vs a bug fix. I don't think there is a UI element for representing a missing span today. What should the behavior be when one clicks the missing span for more details. \r\n\r\nI'd propose to have a quick fix for the current issue, which is a blank screen with no error message. And then put a feature enhancement in the backlog for identifying and investigating missing spans.

There are two cases. \r\n\r\n1. The first case is if some provides extra data to the json in elastic and the name is null because it is not one of the names that are expected. That is the reason why it is null. \r\n2. The second case is when an array is provided as a value for tags. It tries to map the key to null and each of the values in the array to a null key.\r\nHere is the output of the second scenario:\r\n```\r\nParser current name nums\r\nParser value null\r\nParser current name null\r\nParser value 1\r\nParser current name null\r\nParser value 2\r\nParser current name null\r\nParser value 3\r\nParser current name nums\r\nParser value null\r\n```\r\nAs you can see both key and value in this case are null but not at the same time.

Just checking again to see if there is any progress on this. Haven't seen any changes in a while. Also noticed the master branch is way ahed of this branch but there is no conflict between the two branches so there shouldn't be any issues merging. However, when I merged the master to branch to my branch I did notice the mysql tests failing and then there was restriction on the Java version has to be between 1.8 >= and < 16. I couldn't build using the latest java version that was provided by openzipkin which is Java 17.
