Thanks.\r\n\r\nFor example we have below case:\r\nExpression: \r\ny = nn.conv(x)\r\ny = transpose(y, axes=0, 3, 1, 2)\r\ny = transpose(y)\r\ny = transpose(y)\r\n\r\nExpected transformation:\r\ny = nn.conv(x)\r\ny = transpose(y, axes=0, 3, 1, 2)\r\n\r\nAbove such cases can be multiple in a sequence as well. So we need to have a solution which can handle multiple simplification in one chain. Please let me know, in case i have not clearly expressed. Thanks!\r\n\r\nI understand we can have these points covered in follow up PRs as well. If we are not planning to do it in this PR. Suggest to add TODOs for these points in the source code, which will help in future.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/798144818/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/798493373","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7630#issuecomment-798493373","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7630","id":798493373,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5ODQ5MzM3Mw==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-13T15:14:48Z","updated_at":"2021-03-13T15:21:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@tkonolige please take another look. \r\n\r\nLet us make sure all actionable items are being addressed.

One possible extension would be to try to combine this with the simplify reshape above and target patterns like reshape->transpose->reshape or transpose->reshape->transpose\r\n\r\nThat's an interesting point and I just thought about it. However, reshape and transpose cannot be equivalent in any cases, because reshape just changes the definition of accessing the tensor; while transpose reorganizes the element order in memory. Even we combine them to the same patterm, we still need to deal with each case separately and result in no code reuse. Please let me know if I missed something.

updated to cast to float32 only in the problematic case, which is VK + dynamic input on TIR scan. I think this is an acceptable solution for now. Of course, the best solution is to implement TIR level CSE, since the host is doing the same compute anyway and there is no point computing log2 etc in device.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, TIR mergepath kernel used in sort, which is also littered with glsl log2 and ceil, doesn't cast to float64 before log2 in the GPU IR. If you see the IR dump https://gist.github.com/masahi/c0979c61907af15f9924b3b3d72fe6a7, there is no `float64` anywhere. But for TIR scan downsweep kernel, there is a cast to `float64`. So I removed cast to float32 in TIR sort.\r\n\r\nIt could also be the case that our SPIRV codegen for int64 to float64 cast is busted, but I haven't checked. Another weird thing is that glsl log2 on fp64 works correctly if the input size is static.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/800543774/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/800547191","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7672#issuecomment-800547191","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7672","id":800547191,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwMDU0NzE5MQ==","user":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-16T19:33:38Z","updated_at":"2021-03-16T19:33:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Since this is not a opencl specific problem, ideally we should think about how to handle this case in all backends.

We would love to move fast and get this series of PRs quickly merged with proper unittests (and possible some of the integration test) - opening possibilities for developers to write demos and do codegen with TensorIR is the most urgent actionable item. After those PRs are merged, we should then move fast and write really good specs on how it works to attract interested users.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't mean we should lower the bar of documents. Within the scope of this PR, I think it will be good enough to document each user-facing method clearly, like what we have been continuously pushing for. In the next PR, which includes a set of key data structures, I will provide a list of glossaries in the documents so that readers could better understand. The stub file and the spec can be done after M1s and M2s are fully upstreamed, when we started to have alphas for interested users :-)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/800821686/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/800825890","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7496#issuecomment-800825890","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7496","id":800825890,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwMDgyNTg5MA==","user":{"login":"monklof","id":2393551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzOTM1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2393551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/monklof","html_url":"https://github.com/monklof","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monklof/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monklof/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monklof/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monklof/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monklof/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monklof/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monklof/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monklof/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monklof/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-17T06:15:28Z","updated_at":"2021-03-17T06:15:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Also please add test cases to cover your changes.\r\n\r\n@comaniac Thanks a lot!\r\n\r\nTest case has been added for the frontend's changes, and the existing test cases can hit the code changes in TOPI(dense and batch_matmul)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/800825890/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/800850534","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7680#issuecomment-800850534","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7680","id":800850534,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwMDg1MDUzNA==","user":{"login":"new-TonyWang","id":46778179,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Nzc4MTc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46778179?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/new-TonyWang","html_url":"https://github.com/new-TonyWang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/new-TonyWang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/new-TonyWang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/new-TonyWang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/new-TonyWang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/new-TonyWang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/new-TonyWang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/new-TonyWang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/new-TonyWang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/new-TonyWang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-17T07:07:03Z","updated_at":"2021-03-17T07:07:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"There still remains some maven errors in jvm due to the incompatible java version and lack of jni head file paths in 'jvm/native/linux-x86_64', maybe the windows have the same error but I have no windows pc to test it.
