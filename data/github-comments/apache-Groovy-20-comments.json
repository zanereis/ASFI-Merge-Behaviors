Maybe making this change is more trouble than it is worth. The visit/accept names are after all just a convention. Some languages use dispatch instead of visit by convention for instance. I agree that using visit/visit as our convention is probably unique if not a little strange but most of us have become familiar with it. An alternative might be to just rename the parameter from visitor -> acceptedVisitor.
