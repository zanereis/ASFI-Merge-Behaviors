Multiple variables files can be specified, as demonstrated in the meta pipeline scripts.  Raw, command-line variables can also be specified.  These are parsed by the `yaml.load` parser, and as such accepts any valid YML or JSON string.\r\n\r\nThe script is also hardened against interpolating variables that are not specified, as the Jinja default is to interpolate unspecified variables to an empty string.  This initially caused a few errors, as things were interpolating to empty, perhaps without our collective knowledge.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, there are two `TODO`s in this PR.  Notably:\r\n\r\n* What should the default value of  `benchmarks.baseline_branch` be?  How is it handled when this had been blank?  @balesh2 @pivotal-jbarrett, do either of you have context on that?\r\n\r\n* What should the default value of `test.PARALLEL_GRADLE` be?  Should we permit a default value, or require that a valid test spec has this value?  I see that there is a safeguard check in the `execute_*` scripts that sets it to true.  It seems to me that we should set that here rather than interpret downstream that blank means \"yes do parallel.\"  Thoughts, @smgoller @rhoughton-pivot?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/469412064/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/469436673","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/3265#issuecomment-469436673","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/3265","id":469436673,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2OTQzNjY3Mw==","user":{"login":"jinmeiliao","id":15638418,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjM4NDE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15638418?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao","html_url":"https://github.com/jinmeiliao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-04T21:53:22Z","updated_at":"2019-03-04T21:53:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@Petahhh ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/469436673/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/469478123","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/3266#issuecomment-469478123","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/3266","id":469478123,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2OTQ3ODEyMw==","user":{"login":"kirklund","id":1444301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDQzMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1444301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund","html_url":"https://github.com/kirklund","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-05T00:03:21Z","updated_at":"2019-03-05T00:03:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"In VSD, I can see every statistics instance showing the PID now in the PID column with one exception: StatSamplerStats.

If you look at the current [benchmark results in the CI](https://concourse.apachegeode-ci.info/teams/main/pipelines/apache-develop-main?groups=complete) you will notice the get based benchmarks. Those are currently pegged at this throughput rate regardless of the number of threads thrown at the client above about 32 threads. By removing the lock contention in the connection pool the throughput with ~600 threads is nearly 3 times as fast and can continue to scale up with threads and processors.\r\n\r\nYou can run these benchmarks yourself.

But, at least the initial prefill does not happen because it thinks we are already at the min of one because at the same time the prefill thread checked to see if count was at min, another test thread tried to connect. It failed but while it is trying to connect it sets count to 1. Still debugging to see why prefill did not get rescheduled later.\r\nWe accidently changed borrowConnection to no longer call startBackgroundPrefill() if it fail to create a connection and decs the count back down.
