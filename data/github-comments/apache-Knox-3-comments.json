Please attach it to the JIRA itself.\r\nOne thing that I am concerned about is the inclusion of sensitive credentials in the JWT based cookie.\r\nThe cookie from KnoxSSO is intended for browsers and generally represents the authenticated user but doesn't include credentials. It is essentially in clear text since the JWT is merely base64 encoded. This is not sufficient protection for credentials that can be used outside of the scope of Knox itself.\r\nIn terms of usecases, I'd like to understand the full flow including how/where the credentials are actually used and what consumer will be provided in Knox for the credentials.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/issues/comments/535080439/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/issues/comments/535102737","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/knox/pull/153#issuecomment-535102737","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/issues/153","id":535102737,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNTEwMjczNw==","user":{"login":"sharad-oss","id":55712943,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NzEyOTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55712943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharad-oss","html_url":"https://github.com/sharad-oss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharad-oss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharad-oss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharad-oss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharad-oss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharad-oss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharad-oss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharad-oss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharad-oss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharad-oss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-25T16:26:57Z","updated_at":"2019-09-25T16:26:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@lmccay sure will work on the one pager doc soon, and update the JIRA.

I'm not completely sure how the test works, but with the change in this PR, all connection attempts that experience a socket timeout are automatically given a 403, whereas without the change, there would at least be an attempt to contact the failover nodes.\r\n\r\n...then again, I suppose this wouldn't explain the successes in JDK8. It's a bit difficult to tell without looking at the reports unfortunately.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/issues/comments/551308335/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/issues/comments/551362526","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/knox/pull/177#issuecomment-551362526","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/issues/177","id":551362526,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MTM2MjUyNg==","user":{"login":"risdenk","id":3384157,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzODQxNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3384157?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk","html_url":"https://github.com/risdenk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-08T02:55:19Z","updated_at":"2019-11-08T02:55:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jameschen1519 I don't think the test failures are related to your change. \r\n\r\n> (On that note, is there any good way to check the Surefire reports/view build artifacts?)\r\n\r\nThe Travis build details are linked in the pr and then you go to the specific build and build log.
