Just so you know, blueorangutan is running full smoke test suite. Similar failures are seen in other PR as well. So some of the tests may have been failing for some time and need to be fixed.\n\nFrom the above list of failures test_router_dhcphosts are due to test errors that is being addressed by https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1683\n\nI have addressed below two test failures. support for internal LB was not added in the logic creating ips.json databag, I made a fix for that as well.\n\ntest_02_internallb_roundrobin_1RVPC_3VM_HTTP_port80\ntest_01_internallb_roundrobin_1VPC_3VM_HTTP_port80\n\nrest of the failures i am investigating if they are regressions, and test failures.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/249529068/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/249538987","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1688#issuecomment-249538987","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1688","id":249538987,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0OTUzODk4Nw==","user":{"login":"jburwell","id":285646,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTY0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/285646?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell","html_url":"https://github.com/jburwell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-26T10:52:41Z","updated_at":"2016-09-26T10:52:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@PaulAngus
