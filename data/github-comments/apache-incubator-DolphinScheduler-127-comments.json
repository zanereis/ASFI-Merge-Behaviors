the disadvantages mentioned about the current task node:\r\n\r\n\r\n> DS has two type of nodes. The one will sent to woker to execute, like SQL, Shell, MR etc. Another will control the workflow, like sub_process, condition etc. If I make all kinds of nodes supporting blocking, the nodes which will be sent to worker have the right to control workflow in a way. From this perspective, coupling appeared.\r\n\r\nI think the blocking is not a fully workflow controlling as it can only pause and continue the flow, not branching the flow, and the node itself should has rights and domain knowledges to determine if everything as expected.\r\n\r\n> In DAG, it is hard to recognize which node marked to be blocking node without double click to see the node detail information.\r\n\r\nMaybe just a different icon marking will do that?
