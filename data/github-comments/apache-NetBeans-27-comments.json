For your questions:\r\n\r\n1. The license for the generated files follows the licenses used for the input sources. As a basic rule: If you don't have a license, you can't distribute it. In this case to be faithful to the input, I would declare that the combined files contain CDDL-1.0 and CDDL-1.1 licenses files -- this is true for the API, for the Parser I think I saw only CDDL-1.1.\r\n2. I think your observation is correct the target `create-jars-from-glassfish` is not executed automaticly. I would wager that this is an artifact of the times when maven central was not that popular/when the artifacts were not distributed on maven central. For the approach to regenerate the file every time the build is run: please don't. In `enterprise/web.core.syntax` you can see two thinks: the file is only generated when necessary (`-check-prepared-doc`) and only build when the release target is invoked (`<target name=\"-process.release.files\" depends=\"prepare-doc\"/>`). This can be adapted for these two modules. For `web.jspparser`, `ext-compile` looks like a good place to hook into and for the api the approach from `web.core.syntax` should be usable. I would remove the whole `create-jars-from-glassfish`  when you are done as I gets replaced by your work.\r\n3. Yes tests are pretty much broken. I assume when the donation was prepared `project3` and other files were not deemed donateable and thus removed from the codebase. You can recover at least parts of the unittest by commenting out line 108 in `org.netbeans.modules.web.jspparser.TestUtil#setup`. Then you would at least have a smoke test if something broke.\r\n\r\nFurther comments:\r\n1. You'll need to revisit the construction of the `servlet3.1-jsp2.3-api.jar` file. You are packaging all schema files, while the original build only choose a subset (see `web.jspparser/build.xml` from line 138 onwards.\r\n2. Please follow the naming established in `web.core.syntax` for the generated artifacts: 1. prefix the filename with `generated-` and add a header to the license file `Type: generated`. Background: the `verify-all-libs-and-licenses` target of the netbeans build will flag the missing files for the licenses - but with the changes suggested in the answer 2. above the file will only be created when needed, so it would be a false positive.

For example, o.n.swing.plaf.aqua.AquaSeparatorUI is registered and initialized in a similar manner.\r\n\r\nJust to be sure, I added a stacktrace dump from SmoothScrollPaneUI.createUI. On Java 10, it definitively gets called:\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.netbeans.swing.plaf.util.SmoothScrollPaneUI.createUI(SmoothScrollPaneUI.java:103)\r\nat java.base/jdk.internal.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)\r\nat java.base/jdk.internal.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:62)\r\nat java.base/jdk.internal.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43)\r\nat java.base/java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:564)\r\nat sun.reflect.misc.Trampoline.invoke(MethodUtil.java:71)\r\nat jdk.internal.reflect.GeneratedMethodAccessor17.invoke(Unknown Source)\r\nat java.base/jdk.internal.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43)\r\nat java.base/java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:564)\r\nat java.base/sun.reflect.misc.MethodUtil.invoke(MethodUtil.java:260)\r\nat java.desktop/javax.swing.UIDefaults.getUI(UIDefaults.java:804)\r\nat java.desktop/javax.swing.UIManager.getUI(UIManager.java:1065)\r\nat java.desktop/javax.swing.JScrollPane.updateUI(JScrollPane.java:391)\r\nat java.desktop/javax.swing.JScrollPane.<init>(JScrollPane.java:306)\r\nat java.desktop/javax.swing.JScrollPane.<init>(JScrollPane.java:324)\r\nat org.netbeans.modules.editor.NbEditorUI.createExtComponent(NbEditorUI.java:234)\r\nat org.netbeans.editor.EditorUI.getExtComponent(EditorUI.java:929)\r\nat org.netbeans.modules.editor.NbEditorDocument.createEditor(NbEditorDocument.java:176)\r\nat org.openide.text.CloneableEditorInitializer.initCustomEditor(CloneableEditorInitializer.java:511)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also confirmed, via print statements, that SmoothScrollPaneUI ends up receiving and processing mouse wheel events in the editor and other IDE scroll panes (e.g. the Projects sidebar panel).\r\n\r\nAs for BasicScrollPaneUI, that one does seem to be public (but you were probably talking about SmoothScrollPane). See https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/javax/swing/plaf/basic/package-summary.html .\r\n\r\n> Neither Metal, Nimbus nor GTK LAF enter the conditional in Startup#installSmoothScrollPane (line 266) they all come with their custom implementation for ScrollPaneUI.\r\n\r\nThat's correct; I intended this patch to be a little more conservative than the original IntelliJ patch. The original IntelliJ patch applied to all subclasses of BasicScrollPaneUI (via reflection), not just plain BasicScrollPaneUI.\r\n\r\nTesting NetBeans on the Metal LAF on Windows reveals that Metal _does_ have the same scrolling problem as the default Windows LAF did prior to this patch. So in theory it would benefit from the same fix. But since Metal and other LAFs have their own ScrollPaneUI implementations, applying the fix would require either (1) creating a new subclass for each LAF, or (2) using reflection to replace the private mouseScrollListener field as was done in the original IntelliJ code. The latter seems fragile, and when I did it, I got stern console warnings from Java warning that the particular reflective access in question might not be permitted in the future. So for now, this patch only affects the Windows LAF.\r\n\r\nWhich LAF is the default on Linux? (Is it the same for all distros?) Is there a similar scrolling problem there that might benefit from a more generalized version of this patch?\r\n\r\nNote that the MacOS (Aqua) LAF does not require this patch; it already has nice smooth scrolling.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/426116915/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/426143392","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/881#issuecomment-426143392","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/881","id":426143392,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNjE0MzM5Mg==","user":{"login":"eirikbakke","id":886243,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NjI0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/886243?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke","html_url":"https://github.com/eirikbakke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-02T04:11:48Z","updated_at":"2018-10-02T04:11:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I pushed another commit with the suggested changes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/426143392/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/426493151","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/917#issuecomment-426493151","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/917","id":426493151,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNjQ5MzE1MQ==","user":{"login":"dukescript","id":10329598,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzI5NTk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10329598?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dukescript","html_url":"https://github.com/dukescript","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dukescript/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dukescript/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dukescript/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dukescript/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dukescript/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dukescript/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dukescript/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dukescript/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dukescript/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-03T02:35:55Z","updated_at":"2018-10-03T02:39:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> So, I think this is a great idea - but the patch is adding the libraries to the\r\n> standard (platform) build, no? \r\n> While I would appreciate that, this does not seem to be allowed per \r\n> Apache rules due to the license?\r\n\r\nRight. The modules cannot be part of regular distribution. They need to be downloaded on demand.
