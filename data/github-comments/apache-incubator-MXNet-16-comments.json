too brief because I was one a phone. I looked at the python lstm example again. You are right, it seems the states are copied over during the whole epoch. The forward states are transferred even if the backward is cut by resetting the gradient. If you want to achieve this with high-level API, it is still possible by having the last states in the LSTM output, and copying that over in the data iteration. See [the Julia sampler](https://github.com/dmlc/MXNet.jl/blob/master/examples/char-lstm/sampler.jl#L58) for example.\n\nBut I think this is pretty much what you could achieve without extending a lot the current feedforward API.

I can think of two options:\n- some stand-alone `C` programs like `C5.0` drop the model parameters (splits and variables in that case) into a text file that is then parsed at prediction time by separate code. You could have a defined format to export the weights and biases and some `R` or  `C++` code could parse it for making predictions. This is basically what @thirdwing is proposing (I think)\n- it wouldn't be difficult, even for large networks, to have your code write an actual `R` function for the prediction equation (including the weight and bias values to full precision). It is kludgy but is the most portable way of accomplishing the goal.\n\nThanks,\n\nMax\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/157783945/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/157797425","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/619#issuecomment-157797425","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/619","id":157797425,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1Nzc5NzQyNQ==","user":{"login":"zachmayer","id":581590,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MTU5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/581590?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachmayer","html_url":"https://github.com/zachmayer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachmayer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachmayer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachmayer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachmayer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachmayer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachmayer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachmayer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachmayer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachmayer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-18T17:47:36Z","updated_at":"2015-11-18T17:47:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"If you could provide some docs on writing new optimizers, I'll try my hand at porting adagrad from keras:\nhttps://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/a19c9ecfbd99a0fc60c476fb8a0fbd3284a9d620/keras/optimizers.py#L116\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/157797425/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/157804273","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/540#issuecomment-157804273","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/540","id":157804273,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NzgwNDI3Mw==","user":{"login":"jermainewang","id":4057701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNTc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4057701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jermainewang","html_url":"https://github.com/jermainewang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jermainewang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jermainewang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jermainewang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jermainewang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jermainewang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jermainewang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jermainewang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jermainewang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jermainewang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-18T18:04:51Z","updated_at":"2015-11-18T18:04:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi,\n\nHere is a simple example on how to do it in callback way.
