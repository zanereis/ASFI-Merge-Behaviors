Pulsar provides truly async client, while Kafka is coming from the blocking world\r\n2. Pulsar consumer API is simpler than Kafka's (where if you don't poll you might end up de-assigned from the partition (sic!))\r\n3. Running Kafka behind NAT is problematic, while Pulsar can be used with a proxy\r\n4. Pulsar SQL is a driver for Presto, not a brand new tech from scratch by a commercial owner of the tech\r\n5.
