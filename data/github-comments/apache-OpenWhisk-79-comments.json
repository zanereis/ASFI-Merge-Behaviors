So the resolution is to gc even if a container doesn't get reused... because the common case is reuse? Did you consider running the gc on startup when the container is warm instead of on exit instead? This doesn't penalize the transient containers and allows for some slack between the docker unapause and /run to cover some of the latency.\r\n\r\nWe do make it known it's a feature that a warm container can be detected with user code by leaving  \"state\" around; I'd consider the gc an advanced feature and let users know they should run it if needed rather than always forcing.

We don't want much swapping but occasional use of it for an infrequent major GC is not terrible.

Thanks.\r\nI also hope many people can develop ow with docker for mac.\r\n\r\nThe main Issues being handled in this pr are as follow.\r\n\r\n1. Docker0 network does not exist on OSX. (No direct connection to container is possible)\r\n2. Squid proxy returns `503 service unavailable` in case of connection failure(`connection refused`)\r\n3. Because of 2, few tests are failing.\r\n\r\nIf you use docker-compose with docker for mac, surely you will face similar issues.\r\nAnd same workaround will work for you.\r\n\r\nLast time, I tried to solve 2 by changing the semantic of core modules.\r\nBut many people had concerns on it.\r\nNow I am trying to change the behavior of proxy.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd regarding question on squid, I am using squid as a forward proxy.\r\nIn OW world, nginx is being used as a reverse proxy.\r\n\r\nWhile proceeding this issue, I focused on minimizing manual user work and changes on existing module as much as possible.\r\n\r\nNginx also can be used as a forward proxy.\r\nBut we need many configuration changes on nginx.\r\n(Even I am not sure nginx can work as forward and reverse proxy at the same time)\r\n\r\nWith squid, user can just `docker pull`/`docker run` it from public docker hub.\r\nI have no preference on squid. I just used it because it is a mature solution.\r\n\r\nI have tested few other forward proxies such as polipo, but did not work.\r\nEven I was thinking of implementing simple new proxy by myself and publicize it on docker hub.\r\nSince it requires too much efforts, I am looking for the other way.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/302842335/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/302845563","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/2269#issuecomment-302845563","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2269","id":302845563,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMjg0NTU2Mw==","user":{"login":"csantanapr","id":1094878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTQ4Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1094878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr","html_url":"https://github.com/csantanapr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-20T02:38:10Z","updated_at":"2017-05-20T02:39:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I

Any feedback will be highly appreciated.\r\n\r\n# Using the init action\r\n\r\nThe `/whisk.system/init` action offers a convenient way to deploy an action with its dependencies to OpenWhisk.\r\n\r\nThe action accepts following parameters:\r\n\r\nParameters \r\n\r\nParameters    | Description\r\n------------- | -------------\r\nname | Name of the action to be created\r\nlocation  | Directory containing action files\r\nkind  | Action runtime for example: nodejs:default, swift:default\r\n\r\n## Creating action with nodejs runtime\r\n\r\nTo create an action in nodejs runtime, you must have `index.js` and `package.js` for any dependencies. `/whisk.system/init` installs dependencies locally using `npm install` followed by zipping up the action and its dependencies and creates an action using that zip file.\r\n\r\n```\r\nls -1 helloworld/src/\r\nindex.js\r\npackage.json\r\ncd helloworld/src/\r\nnpm install\r\nzip -rq action.zip *\r\nwsk action create helloworld --kind nodejs:6 action.zip\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll you have to run is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nwsk action invoke /whisk.system/init --param name helloworld --param location helloworld/src --param kind nodejs --blocking\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Question: \r\n\r\nShould `/whisk.system/init` be responsible for cleaning up after creating helloworld action?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/303198754/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/303202297","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/2243#issuecomment-303202297","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2243","id":303202297,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMzIwMjI5Nw==","user":{"login":"mrutkows","id":7816715,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MTY3MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7816715?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrutkows","html_url":"https://github.com/mrutkows","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrutkows/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrutkows/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrutkows/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrutkows/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrutkows/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrutkows/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrutkows/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrutkows/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrutkows/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-22T19:52:23Z","updated_at":"2017-05-22T19:52:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Perhaps we should not call the action \"init\" as this has meaning in the context of the CLI.

regarding Docker volumes from Kafka container:\r\n\r\n- The `Dockerfile` for Kafka creates two unnamed volumes: https://hub.docker.com/r/ches/kafka/~/dockerfile/\r\n- `docker rm` won't remove volumes unless option `-v` is specified: https://docs.docker.com/v1.12/engine/reference/commandline/rm/\r\n- The `clean`script of Ansible `kafka` role only asserts that the `kafka` Docker container is absent: https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/blob/master/ansible/roles/kafka/tasks/clean.yml\r\n- The Ansible `docker_container` module support volume management via parameter `keep_volumes` which is set to `true` by default: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/docker_container_module.html. \r\n\r\nIn other words: at least for the `kafka` container, we don't clean up volumes when removing containers but retain them such that disk space fills up if volumes are not removed otherwise.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes said problem. Looks good to me.\r\n\r\n@jeremiaswerner - please review and merge this

Currently Tracing results will be consumed by Sys Admins and developers interested in System performance.  Here are my thoughts on extending it to action developers. \r\n1) Either the same Tracing server(used by OpenWhisk) is shared with users. \r\n    - Which would then raise question about how to control access to it.\r\n    - Will viewing overall system trace along with action, is it relevant for the action developers?\r\n\r\n2) Different Trace server which action developers setup\r\n    - Propagating TraceId will only make sense if its same server, if users set their own Trace collector then trace span propagation would not work. \r\n    - In this case action can have code to send trace to their respective server.
