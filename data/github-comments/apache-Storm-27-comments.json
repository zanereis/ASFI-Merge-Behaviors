Authentication</p>\n\n<p>    Hi Bobby,<br/>\n      I have made the changes for the SASL Netty Authentication.  Currently the credentials used is with the topology name, but I thought I would be using Kerberos token instead as we agreed I will use randomly generated credentials that are kept in zookeeper.  I will try to find it out which method to call or if you can help me out it would be great.  In the meantime you can review the changes.</p>\n\n<p>     I have tested the changes but didn't create the unit tests.  I will create a separate JIRA for unit test and get it done.  I am learning Clojure and will get it done soon.</p>\n\n<p>    Thanks,<br/>\n    Raghavendra Nandagopal</p>\n\n<p>You can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:</p>\n\n<p>    $ git
