SSL would not protect against a XSS attack, it would only protect from the fact that you are sending your credentials and sessionkey unencrypted from your machine to the server. If you are doing so over a secure network that you trust, using SSL might even be irrelevant, depending on the situation. So, SSL will only protect your credentials/session on the transport layer, other nasty XSS scripts might still gain access to whatever is stored in your browser. Setting the cookie as HttpOnly prevents your own browser from reading it, and thus makes that information safe from XSS.\n\nIf you're having issues with a reverse proxy in front of it, the issue is probably with the reverse proxy or browser config... here's where i see it might be going wrong on your setup:\n- Proxy is destroying the cookie;\n- Proxy is not allowing the cookie in the first place;\n- Proxy if forcing a new session to be generated;\n- Browser isn't allowing cookies on the https url (perhaps configured manually to always reject cookies and an exception for the http:// cloudstack url ?)\n- Proxy might be delivering a cached version of cloudStack.js without the fix;\n\nCould you share some more info on your reverse proxy setup? I'll can try to reproduce your issue and give you a hand :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/109981697/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/110004148","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/308#issuecomment-110004148","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/308","id":110004148,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExMDAwNDE0OA==","user":{"login":"vadimkim","id":352430,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MjQzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/352430?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadimkim","html_url":"https://github.com/vadimkim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadimkim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadimkim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadimkim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadimkim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadimkim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadimkim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadimkim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadimkim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadimkim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-08T13:55:47Z","updated_at":"2015-06-08T14:27:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rsafonseca \nThank you for explanation.

While I have found, that most of the logic works just perfect behind the proxy there are 2 issues that need to be fixed \n- login procedure somewhere uses direct path (not relative) and tried to call /client/api?command directly. I have fixed it by 1 rewrite rule (see below). Otherwise login is not possible -- 404 response.\n- F5 brakes session if I work over HTTPS proxy. Hope we will fix it together.\n\nI am using very simple nginx conf.

I'll have some time later this week to help you test packaging related stuff.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/110141856/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/110144112","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/372#issuecomment-110144112","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/372","id":110144112,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExMDE0NDExMg==","user":{"login":"eriweb","id":6181934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxODE5MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6181934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eriweb","html_url":"https://github.com/eriweb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eriweb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eriweb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eriweb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eriweb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eriweb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eriweb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eriweb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eriweb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eriweb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-08T21:21:14Z","updated_at":"2015-06-08T21:21:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I'm by no means an expert on this, but isn't the reason we didn't ship the mysql connector previously due to licensing? @ke4qqq or @runseb wanna chime in?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/110144112/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/110145052","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/372#issuecomment-110145052","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/372","id":110145052,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExMDE0NTA1Mg==","user":{"login":"eriweb","id":6181934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxODE5MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6181934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eriweb","html_url":"https://github.com/eriweb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eriweb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eriweb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eriweb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eriweb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eriweb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eriweb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eriweb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eriweb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eriweb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-08T21:23:15Z","updated_at":"2015-06-08T21:23:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"By the way, what kind of testing has this undergone?

You listed 11 changes and said that you might have forgotten another few. That's a bit dangerous and also make testing the PR way to expansive for the reviewers.\n\nWe should have 1 PR per feature/fix, or perhaps a couple of fixes, depending on their size (fixing findbugs is a good example).\n\nAnother good practice is to add the environment where the things were tested, and also the steps you took to test it, in the PR. Adding those afterwards, as comments, it's also not very good to follow.\n\nReading your list I would say that you have at least 4 PRs.\n1. Tomcat/Jetty changes\n2. Packaging\n3. Configs and Distros\n4. JDK version\n\nIn addition, the a PR should be independent of any other. Thus, we could for example test 4 and merge it without waiting for 2 or 3.\n\nIf PR follows that structure I think we can get them merge way faster than now.\n\nI hope you appreciate the feedback. We are working to achieve the same goal.\n\nCheers,\nWilder\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/110239298/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/110242990","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/372#issuecomment-110242990","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/372","id":110242990,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExMDI0Mjk5MA==","user":{"login":"serverchief","id":3730876,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MzA4NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3730876?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/serverchief","html_url":"https://github.com/serverchief","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serverchief/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serverchief/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serverchief/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serverchief/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serverchief/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serverchief/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serverchief/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serverchief/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serverchief/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-09T06:24:17Z","updated_at":"2015-06-09T06:24:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm with Wilder on this.

But where do I get server cookie then? \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/110282737/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/110293689","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/308#issuecomment-110293689","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/308","id":110293689,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExMDI5MzY4OQ==","user":{"login":"rsafonseca","id":12141667,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQxNjY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12141667?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca","html_url":"https://github.com/rsafonseca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-09T09:33:27Z","updated_at":"2015-06-09T09:33:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vadimkim are you building the latest version of this PR?

@rsafonseca, your efforts are well appreciated, don't think otherwise.\n\nSmall changes equals, atleast usually, a smaller set of testing. \nThe CloudStack community consists of a lot of different people (and their companies), who all have different needs, agendas, and time available. \n\nSo, while some might have the time and willingness to test packaging, they might not have time, the experience or willingness to test the other changes.\nFor instance, I have no idea how to test the embedded jetty/tomcat changes.\n\nThe bigger a change is, the harder it is to track why it was done, and it's implications, especially when it's not related to a Jira issue/FS or similar.\n\nThis is not to say that your PR cannot be merged, but waiting for someone to either have tested all the changes, or for enough people to have tested each subset could take time.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/110320351/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/110322117","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/375#issuecomment-110322117","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/375","id":110322117,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExMDMyMjExNw==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-09T11:24:17Z","updated_at":"2015-06-09T11:24:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[cloudstack-pull-requests

\n\nThe KVM tests are running. I had problems with my environment (as you might have seen on Slcak) and had to restart them. However, when I try to run the tests on XenServer62 I get the following error:\n\nCSLog: CRITICAL: EXCEPTION: None: ['Traceback (most recent call last):\\n', '  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/nose-1.3.6-py2.7.egg/nose/suite.py\", line 209, in run\\n    self.setUp()\\n', '  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/nose-1.3.6-py2.7.egg/nose/suite.py\", line 292, in setUp\\n    self.setupContext(ancestor)\\n', '  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/nose-1.3.6-py2.7.egg/nose/suite.py\", line 315, in setupContext\\n    try_run(context, names)\\n', '  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/nose-1.3.6-py2.7.egg/nose/util.py\", line 471, in try_run\\n    return func()\\n', '  File \"/data/git/cs2/cloudstack/test/integration/component/test_vpc_network_pfrules.py\", line 195, in setUpClass\\n    cls.zone.id,\\n', \"AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'id'\\n\"]\n\nOn line 195 we have the following:\n\n```\n    cls.template = get_template(\n                                cls.api_client,\n  195 here ===>                              cls.zone.id,\n                                cls.services[\"ostype\"]\n                                )\n```\n\nIt seems that the test can't retrieve the zone when using XenServer, which is very weird.\n\nAs I mentioned above, KVM runs just fine!
