@codelipenghui In terms of implementation, it would actually be simpler to allow multiple producers with the same name, if they have different producer groups.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, if we have producerGroups and unique producerNames across all groups, we need to have two hash maps (producers, and producerGroups), and we would need to coordinate access to both (e.g. via locking), two prevent concurrent calls to e.g. Topic.add(producer) from getting them out of sync.\r\n\r\nSo unless there are objections, I'd like to change the uniqueness of producers from \"producerName only\" to

Yes I was using a custom SerDe class because of a problem with python 2.7 (here https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/b8679078dc6632795c4d81cff9caedd316444f17/pulsar-client-cpp/python/pulsar/functions/serde.py#L77, that `.encode('utf-8')` is not compatible with python 2.7 since in 2.7 strings are already byte strings). Now I am using Python 3.x so I just removed that cusotm SerDe class and tried again. Unfortunately I have the same error. A thing that I forgot to say is that when I create the function I set also this param `--schema-type SensorSchema`\r\n\r\n```\r\npulsar-admin functions create \\\r\n  --py copyFunction.py \\\r\n  --classname copyFunction.copyFunction  \\\r\n  --schema-type SensorSchema \\\r\n  --tenant public \\\r\n  --namespace default \\\r\n  --name copyFunction1 \\\r\n  --inputs persistent://public/default/topic1 \\\r\n  --output persistent://public/default/topic2\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Yes I forgot to say that I did some modifcation in the `python-instance` you can find it here in my fork https://github.com/nicolo-paganin/pulsar/commit/ca45931ae47bf9f9eec5ad2cd64e043854ca3024. I am not sure if the modification is considering all cases and if it is good, anyway it was a try. The modification permits to write the AvroSchema using `context.publish()`\r\n\r\nI was sure that the schema was present in the topic because I can read data with a consumer and calling this `pulsar-admin schemas get topic2` is returning me the right schema: \r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"version\": 0,\r\n  \"schemaInfo\": {\r\n    \"name\": \"topic2\",\r\n    \"schema\": {\r\n      \"type\": \"record\",\r\n      \"name\": \"SensorSchema\",\r\n      \"namespace\": \"it.oncode.argo.api.actors\",\r\n      \"fields\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"name\": \"value\",\r\n          \"type\": \"double\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"name\": \"timestamp\",\r\n          \"type\": \"long\"\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    },\r\n    \"type\": \"AVRO\",\r\n    \"properties\": {}\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n@sijie do you mean the JAVA producer code?
