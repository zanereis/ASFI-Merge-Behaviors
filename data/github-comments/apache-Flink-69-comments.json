After debugging a bit, I noticed that in your modification of `partitionBox`, the variable `center` is different before and after the call of `partitionBox` in `makeChildren`.  For example, in `makeChildren` I added some lines to print to the console, namely\n\n``` scala\n     println(\"center before partitioning =  \" + center)\n      val cPart = partitionBox(center, width)\n      println(\"cPart =  \" + cPart)\n      val mappedWidth = 0.5*width.asBreeze\n      children = cPart.map(p => new Node(p, mappedWidth.fromBreeze, null))\n      println(\"center after partitioning =  \" + center)\n```\n\nThis is in lines 123-130 in the current commit of QuadTree.scala.  The output to console is\n\n```\ncenter before partitioning =  DenseVector(0.0, 0.0)\ncPart =  List(DenseVector(-0.5, -0.25), DenseVector(-0.5, 0.25), DenseVector(0.5, -0.25), DenseVector(0.5, 0.25))\ncenter after partitioning =  DenseVector(0.5, 0.25)\n```\n\nSo the output `cPart` looks good, but the value of `center` after partitioning should still be `(0.0,0.0)`.  I'm confused as to how it is even changed to `(0.5, 0.25)` the final entry of `cPart`, and hence not clear how to fix that.  I imagine it should be an easy fix; of course I can use a hack to update `center` to be the average of `cPart`, but that seems wasteful since `center`for a given node should not be changed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/151942911/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
