there is a flaw of C client's design, the callback needs to manual free the `pulsar_message_id_t`:\r\n\r\n```c\r\nstatic void asnyc_send_call_back(pulsar_result result, pulsar_message_id_t *msgId, void *ctx)\r\n{\r\n        msg_ctx *pctx = (msg_ctx *)ctx;\r\n\r\n        (void)msgId;  /* msgId points to a block of dynamic allocated memory, so the memory leaks here */\r\n        /* ... */\r\n\r\n        pulsar_message_free(pctx->msg);\r\n        free(pctx);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor the backward compatibility, it cannot be changed. You need to call `pulsar_message_id_free` in the callback function, see

If there is a cookie mismatch, it will fail to come up. Hence for this reason, it would be helpful to see the bookie start up logs for that failed bookie.\r\nNone of the Zookeeper logs will help in this case.\r\n\r\nSpinning up a new bookie would help when autorecovery notices underreplicated ledgers and starts copying them to the new bookie to satisfy write quorum ratios.
