Multiple producer deduplication looks a little complicated.  I think the highest sequence ID maintained in the broker is insufficient to meet such a demand. Maybe we can use the same mechanism of acknowledging the state of the message. The broker maintains a bitset in memory for the not continuous sequence and a mark sequence ID for the continuous sequence that producers sent to the topic. The producers may cause discontinuities(0, 2, 3, 1, 5) and no longer send 5. So that we can add a time window and if the time window passed, sequence ID 4 will no longer be stored. And this also needs this PR.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/604392425/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/604398150","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/6594#issuecomment-604398150","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/6594","id":604398150,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwNDM5ODE1MA==","user":{"login":"pierre94","id":12579749,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTc5NzQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12579749?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierre94","html_url":"https://github.com/pierre94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierre94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierre94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierre94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierre94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierre94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierre94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierre94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierre94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierre94/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-26T12:19:24Z","updated_at":"2020-03-26T12:19:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> @pierre94 shall I close this issue? since 2.4.2 and 2.5.0 have fixed this issue.\r\n\r\nok","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/604398150/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/604428936","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/6433#issuecomment-604428936","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/6433","id":604428936,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwNDQyODkzNg==","user":{"login":"zhanghaou","id":5668441,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2Njg0NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5668441?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghaou","html_url":"https://github.com/zhanghaou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghaou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghaou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghaou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghaou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghaou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghaou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghaou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghaou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghaou/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-26T13:24:20Z","updated_at":"2020-03-26T13:24:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm interesting in fix this issue.

Hi @fracasula. According to your description, did you subscribe only once, right? I noticed you logs\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> [/10.1.1.76:33118] Cleared consumer created after timeout on client side Consumer{subscription=PersistentSubscription{topic=persistent://public/default/UserJoinedSpace, name=cloud-spaceroom-service}, consumerId=18, consumerName=a0869e4030, address=/10.1.1.76:33118}\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> Looks the issue is related to the consumer creation timeout. Can you find any log about `Closed connection from`?\r\n> \r\n> @wolfstudy Hi xiaolong. I want to invite you to join the discussion. Maybe the problem is we don't close the consumer at the broker-side after creating consumer timeout at the client-side.\r\n\r\nHi @codelipenghui, yes that's correct. Our code has been audited by 3 different engineers and we confirm that we're subscribing only once.\r\n\r\nBy looking at our [client logs](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/files/4398450/client_logs.txt) it looks like the client was having issues connecting to the broker so it rescheduled a few reconnections. By looking at the broker side instead we in fact see that the broker received multiple requests for creating that consumer and, although it did detect that a consumer with ID 18 was already present on the connection, my guess is that it didn't close one of the two after all.\r\n\r\nThese are the logs you requested reporting all \"Connection closed from\" on the broker side: [closed_connections_logs.txt](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/files/4398459/closed_connections_logs.txt).\r\n\r\nWe should expect one from `10.1.1.76:33118`, right?\r\n\r\nAnother question, I hope you don't mind. I was looking at this [bit of code](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/service/ServerCnx.java#L795) which clearly gets called in this case. I'm not very familiar with Java and futures so pardon me if the question doesn't make sense but in the comment right above that line you explain that you need to wait until the previous consumer creation request either completes or fails. What happens if that future hangs forever? Is that even possible or is there a timeout that would prevent that from happening so that eventually `isDone` returns?\r\n\r\n**EDIT:** I forgot to mention, the IP you see (i.e. `10.1.1.76`) is not the direct client but the Pulsar Proxy. I'll add it above as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/605603958/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/605615235","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/6517#issuecomment-605615235","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/6517","id":605615235,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwNTYxNTIzNQ==","user":{"login":"jiazhai","id":6348208,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNDgyMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6348208?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai","html_url":"https://github.com/jiazhai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-29T10:27:53Z","updated_at":"2020-03-29T10:27:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@kemburi #6588 merged for fix this issue.
