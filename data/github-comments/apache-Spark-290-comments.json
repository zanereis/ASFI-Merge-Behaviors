I'd suggest starting it off with some simple examples that use SequenceFiles, then adding the Avro stuff later. It's also kind of unfortunate that understanding the Avro example requires understanding Avro and its various intricacies (i.e. the generic/specific/reflect stuff, the various data types in your match statement, etc). If you wanted a simpler example you could use HBase or Cassandra there, but Avro is fine too.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/52083836/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/52083943","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1875#issuecomment-52083943","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1875","id":52083943,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMDgzOTQz","user":{"login":"mateiz","id":228859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODg1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz","html_url":"https://github.com/mateiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-13T17:46:30Z","updated_at":"2014-08-13T17:46:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yup, please fix those too.

Windows spark-shell is currently broken and this will fix it. However, this works as a temporary solution and in the medium-long run we will need something like #1825 for Windows as well.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/52087993/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/52088004","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1918#issuecomment-52088004","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1918","id":52088004,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMDg4MDA0","user":{"login":"andrewor14","id":2133137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzMxMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2133137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewor14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-13T18:15:50Z","updated_at":"2014-08-13T18:15:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"test

This is super important and I have been meaning to get to it for awhile. Here are my thoughts:\n- We probably shouldn't throw an exception when trying to store arrays or maps just because `containsNull/valueContainsNull=true`.  This is because those values mean \"could contain null\" not \"do contain null\", and due to hive semantics we are often very conservative is stating `nullable=false`.\n- It would be great if you could explain how the format is going to change to handle null values.  Is there consensus in the parquet community about how to encode this?  Will the change be backwards incompatible?\n- If its going to be backwards incompatible then it would be really good to make the change before 1.1.  Please open a blocker JIRA targeted at 1.1 if that is the case.  If we don't need to make backwards incompatible changes then this is more a \"very nice to have\" for 1.1.  I'm okay throwing exceptions saying \"not supported\" when people try to store null values into arrays or maps (though this is less than ideal obviously).\n\nThanks again!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/52090218/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/52090432","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1927#issuecomment-52090432","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1927","id":52090432,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMDkwNDMy","user":{"login":"AmplabJenkins","id":4031291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzEyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4031291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/AmplabJenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-13T18:33:16Z","updated_at":"2014-08-13T18:33:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Can one of the admins verify this patch?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/52090432/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/52090709","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1927#issuecomment-52090709","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1927","id":52090709,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMDkwNzA5","user":{"login":"marmbrus","id":527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus","html_url":"https://github.com/marmbrus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-13T18:35:06Z","updated_at":"2014-08-13T18:35:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks Alex!

Also, it would be really good if we could do some (at least micro) benchmarks before an after for on-heap and then a comparison with the external version.  Let me know if you need some help coming up with that.\n\nAlso, one note.  Since this is a pretty major change, I'll want to wait until after the 1.1 release to merge it in.  That said, really excited about it for 1.2.
