to comments by @zellerh \n1. The code adds NULL to the constructor of many collection objects. On one hand, this is good, as it makes people think, on the other hand I'm not sure it really adds much.\nYes, passing in NULL is the same using the default constructor before. Objects are allocated in the global heap. Currently code calls NACollection constructors with NULL for class variables only if no suitable NAHeap object is available. I would claim this is about a dozen or so instances. In these cases the change does no harm but makes no improvement. It will be a longer term project to create a NAHeap object that could be used in these instances. Mostly these classes are shared across many processes or are required early in the life of a process when NAHeap objects have not been created. For stack variables there are many more instances of using NULL. These are harmless as they would get deallocated when the local variable goes out of scope. I view them as equivalent to numerous NAString stack variables that are created without a heap and are therefore allocated in the global heap. Those are not leaks as I understand that memory is reclaimed when the destructor is called on those objects\n1. This is the case discussed in item 1. I don't think they cause problems any worse than now.\n\nI don't quite follow the line of argument in the conclusion, where we state that this makes the situation worse. In these these comments there are already diametrically opposite views on what to do with the default constructors (remove the commented out lines vs. put those lines back and use them). I think this change makes some improvement without causing any regression.\n\nPlease using your voting options to indicate if this should not go in. I will explicitly state which suggested changes suggested I am unable to make. At this point I won't have time to revisit most of these files and make a systematic change. If that is better, we could defer this for later. After all, these leaks have not hurt us explicitly and we could (a) decide on  consensus approach and then start making changes or (b) fix issues in a smaller scale with a real problem at hand.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/252743910/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/252759418","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/752#issuecomment-252759418","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/752","id":252759418,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1Mjc1OTQxOA==","user":{"login":"Traf-Jenkins","id":12548626,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQ4NjI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12548626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/Traf-Jenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-10T22:09:42Z","updated_at":"2016-10-10T22:09:42Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Check
