Hello, we need more information for us to investigate why it was deleted. Usually commitLog will only be deleted automatically by the compaction/retention mechanism. It might be possible that someone deleted the second file by mistake, and you can verify this by Linux auditing tools (like find out the commands executed, other logging info). If it is not human error then we might need you to reproduce this bug before we can dig further into it.\r\n\r\nWe don't delete it artificially. Is it when the system load is high?

\r\n感谢您的回答，我知道您的意思。但是`public synchronized void registerBrokerAll()` 这段代码只是让下面这段代码\r\n\r\n```java\r\n // 启动了一个定时调度的任务，让他去给 NameServer 进行注册\r\n        // 默认 30s 发送一次\r\n        this.scheduledExecutorService.scheduleAtFixedRate(new Runnable() {\r\n\r\n            @Override\r\n            public void run() {\r\n                try {\r\n                    //

Math.min(brokerConfig.getRegisterNameServerPeriod(), 60000)), TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);\r\n\r\n```\r\n线程池里面的线程安全。也就是说 ，他只是保证了定时任务不同批次任务的线程安全。但是仍然无法保证定时任务同一个批次内的线程安全。比如说：某次发送心跳。Broker需要向 10个NameServer 发送心跳。`public List<RegisterBrokerResult> registerBrokerAll`方法是开启10个线程去发送心跳，如果此时同时返回结果，同时修改`registerBrokerResultList`这个`ArrayList`仍然是有并发安全问题的。\r\n\r\n`public synchronized void registerBrokerAll()`

\r\nThanks for your answer, I know what you mean. But `public synchronized void registerBrokerAll()` This code just makes the following code\r\n\r\n```java\r\n // 启动了一个定时调度的任务，让他去给 NameServer 进行注册\r\n        // 默认 30s 发送一次\r\n        this.scheduledExecutorService.scheduleAtFixedRate(new Runnable() {\r\n\r\n            @Override\r\n            public void run() {\r\n                try {\r\n                    // 将自己注册到NameServer\r\n                    BrokerController.this.\r\n                            registerBrokerAll(true, false, brokerConfig.isForceRegister());\r\n                } catch (Throwable e) {\r\n                    log.error(\"registerBrokerAll Exception\", e);\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }, 1000 * 10, Math.max(10000, Math.min(brokerConfig.getRegisterNameServerPeriod(), 60000)), TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);\r\n\r\n```\r\nThread safety in the thread pool. In other words, he only guarantees the thread safety of different batches of timing tasks. However, it is still not possible to guarantee the thread safety of timed tasks in the same batch. For example: send a heartbeat a certain time. Broker needs to send heartbeats to 10 NameServers. `public List<RegisterBrokerResult> registerBrokerAll`The method is to open 10 threads to send heartbeats, if the results are returned at the same time, modify `registerBrokerResultList ArrayList` There are still concurrency security issues.\r\n\r\n`public synchronized void registerBrokerAll()` This code just guarantees, for example, time 0 and time 30. The heartbeats they send have no concurrent security issues.\r\n\r\nThe logic in MQ is similar to the following code logic.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npackage com.example.test.arraylistrocketmq;\r\n\r\nimport
