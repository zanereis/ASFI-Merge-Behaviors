Filed [BEAM-3588](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-3588).\n\nIt's fine to handle only defaults here because it's the same check as in GBK, we're just providing more context in the exception. If new validations are added to basic PTransofrms, then in the worst case SQL will expose those without wrapping.\n\nMy main concern about performing more complex validation is that I'm not sure that we can solve it in general case (or even limited case). And without it it can become confusing if you can define 2 equivalent triggers and one will be rejected while the other will not.\n\n---\n\n*[sdks/java/extensions/sql/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/extensions/sql/impl/rel/BeamAggregationRel.java, line 158 at r1](https://reviewable.io:443/reviews/apache/beam/4546#-L4Ecx-pQb4v_ecbhmEl:-L4EtNcwNzj5e1aeAhhz:b-tw1l6x) ([raw file](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/33eeedfeae4d7534265f237549ff9eb4b5f3d58f/sdks/java/extensions/sql/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/extensions/sql/impl/rel/BeamAggregationRel.java#L158)):*\n<details><summary><i>Previously, kennknowles (Kenn Knowles) wrote…</i></summary><blockquote>\n\nThis one seems a bit silly\n</blockquote></details>\n\nInlined these :) \nI wrote the invocations first to make sure`if` looks sane, and then implementations just ended up this way :) Should have just copied the GBK version from the start\n\n---\n\n*[sdks/java/extensions/sql/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/extensions/sql/impl/rule/AggregateWindowFactory.java, line 40 at r1](https://reviewable.io:443/reviews/apache/beam/4546#-L4EbkphEoAj2-gp5rhM:-L4FISdCztxez_DMCMoh:bq4wpo1) ([raw file](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/33eeedfeae4d7534265f237549ff9eb4b5f3d58f/sdks/java/extensions/sql/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/extensions/sql/impl/rule/AggregateWindowFactory.java#L40)):*\n<details><summary><i>Previously, kennknowles (Kenn Knowles) wrote…</i></summary><blockquote>\n\nSide note - wrote the other comments about `Optional` before I saw this.

Not sure how much they are optimized away to behave as well as nullables but I would use them by default until you find a problem.\n</blockquote></details>\n\nWrapped the whole `AggregateWindowField` into `Optional`.\n\nMy impression was that using `java.util.Optional` in class fields is discouraged (e.g. `java.util.Optional` is not serializable), so I thought that domain-specific logic would be better, and it just happens to have similar semantics with `Maybe`. It could have more state and logic, in my case it probably saved an `Optional.map()`call when extracting `windowFieldIndex`. Don't have a strong opinion in this case.\n\n---\n\n*[sdks/java/extensions/sql/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/extensions/sql/impl/rule/AggregateWindowField.java, line 51 at r1](https://reviewable.io:443/reviews/apache/beam/4546#-L4EbCFdCRLQt5NszKRb:-L4FIIwsVaLKY788H2Jx:bb7f2mf) ([raw file](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/33eeedfeae4d7534265f237549ff9eb4b5f3d58f/sdks/java/extensions/sql/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/extensions/sql/impl/rule/AggregateWindowField.java#L51)):*\n<details><summary><i>Previously, kennknowles (Kenn Knowles) wrote…</i></summary><blockquote>\n\nNow that we are on Java 8, you could use `Optional<AggregateWindowField>` to decouple the data you want to store from the present/absent.\n</blockquote></details>\n\ndone\n\n---\n\n*[sdks/java/extensions/sql/src/test/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/extensions/sql/BeamSqlDslAggregationTest.java, line 472 at r1](https://reviewable.io:443/reviews/apache/beam/4546#-L4Ee6Zzdy24t8aYaiDW:-L4IL5P_kmZOXEyJVFoS:bb7f2mf) ([raw file](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/33eeedfeae4d7534265f237549ff9eb4b5f3d58f/sdks/java/extensions/sql/src/test/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/extensions/sql/BeamSqlDslAggregationTest.java#L472)):*\n<details><summary><i>Previously, kennknowles (Kenn Knowles) wrote…</i></summary><blockquote>\n\nThis is minor, but when I skimmed this I saw the `assertEquals` below and the declaration of `input` above and thought the test was wrong.

It could have more state and logic, in my case it probably saved an `Optional.map()`call when extracting `windowFieldIndex`. Don't have a strong opinion in this case.\n</blockquote></details>\n\nWow, didn't realize the `Optional` was not serializable. Found https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24547673/why-java-util-optional-is-not-serializable-how-to-serialize-the-object-with-suc\n\nPretty arrogant for them to speak as though they were \"designing\" `Optional` since it predates even the first version of Java (same with generics, so I guess there's a pattern). And pretty annoying for them to take a purist stance, since Java is a pragmatic compromise language.\n\nThis `Serializable` issue is a good argument for not including it in fields. And since that is a stupid thing to have to remember, we might just want to ban it (pretty easy to use static analysis to ban classes) and go back to using Guava's `Optional` or rolling our own. Sheesh.\n\n---\n\n\n*Comments from [Reviewable](https://reviewable.io:443/reviews/apache/beam/4546#-:-L4J_yNoGn4Z-sF51pD7:b-ikyoki)*\n<!-- Sent from Reviewable.io -->\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/362476917/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/362478471","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/4577#issuecomment-362478471","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4577","id":362478471,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MjQ3ODQ3MQ==","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-02T03:50:37Z","updated_at":"2018-02-02T03:50:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"BTW I'm working on the same thing to get a proper import to IntelliJ.
