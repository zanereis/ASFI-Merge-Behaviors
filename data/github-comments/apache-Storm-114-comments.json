in, compile and deploy in one node.<br/>\nLaunched a wordcount topology and then tried to run \"storm kill_workers\", it can kill the running workers. However,<br/>\nthe supervisor is still active, it will restart the workers with different PIDs.<br/>\nBTW, I didn't met the problem of \"my-worker-ids returns empty\".<br/>\nAnd I have all configuration as defaults (no storm.yaml added).</p>\n\n<p>For better test, you can manually kill supervisor process, and then run the \"storm kill_workers\".<br/>\nI did this, and it cleanly killed the running workers (this is also one of the main purposes for having this CLI, <br/>\ncleaning up the isolated workers in problematic node).</p>\n\n<p>Zhuo</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612603343/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612603347","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4896#issuecomment-2612603347","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4896","id":2612603347,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI2MDMzNDc=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-01T22:54:40Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T14:01:49Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=rashshah\">rashshah</a>:</i>\n<p>Zhuo,</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for help.
