In this example we'll create `~/src/libapps/`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ mkdir ~/src\r\n$ cd ~/src\r\n$ git clone https://chromium.googlesource.com/apps/libapps\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Build hterm\r\n\r\nThe build process bundles some resources as JavaScript source and concatenates the JavaScript into a single file (`hterm_all.js`).\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd ~/src/libapps\r\n$ ./hterm/bin/mkdist.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe files are all written to `./hterm/dist/js/`. Copy the `hterm_all.js` file into your project.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/491684736/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/491829180","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/3348#issuecomment-491829180","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/3348","id":491829180,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MTgyOTE4MA==","user":{"login":"zjffdu","id":164491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu","html_url":"https://github.com/zjffdu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-13T13:47:16Z","updated_at":"2019-05-13T13:47:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @d3adp007 ， merging","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/491829180/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/491829926","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/3315#issuecomment-491829926","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/3315","id":491829926,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MTgyOTkyNg==","user":{"login":"zjffdu","id":164491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu","html_url":"https://github.com/zjffdu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-13T13:49:16Z","updated_at":"2019-05-13T13:49:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"ping @dbanda Could you address the comments ?
