Looking at [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63169737/kubernetes-api-list-pods-with-a-label) you can query the Kubernetes API server, but I don't know all of the intricacies involved with what appears to be auth tokens, the type of results that are returned, latency, etc.\r\n> \r\n> You can use the [downward api](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/downward-api/) to expose some pod info (including labels and annotations) via files or environment variables inside the pod. I'm wondering if that would be sufficient?\r\n\r\nYou can do this pretty easily in your pod definition with setting a metadata label. \r\nThe common approach is having the balancer process hit the k8s API using a service account to query for all pods with a specific label type. \r\n\r\nHowever, If you want to reduce the balancer's \"knowledge\" of k8s existing then you could inject the label metadata via a environment variable in your pod spec set to the same label value.\r\n\r\nThis would still require the balancer to understand the concept of groups, but remove the k8s requirement from accumulo-based code.

I don't think the build needs to break to separate those out.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1422252698/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1422279637","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/2827#issuecomment-1422279637","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/2827","id":1422279637,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5UxkPV","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-08T09:19:04Z","updated_at":"2023-02-08T09:19:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> This PR will be superseded by the changes with #3161\r\n\r\nIn that case, I'm closing this, so we can focus on reviewing that one.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1422279637/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1422338787","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/3187#issuecomment-1422338787","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/3187","id":1422338787,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5Uxyrj","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-08T10:04:06Z","updated_at":"2023-02-08T10:04:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@dlmarion wrote:\r\n> This was something that a user noticed their client waiting on, and not performing scans, when the user thought scans should have been running.\r\n\r\nAside from their surprise at the observation, what kind of impact did this cause? Do we know how long the user's scans were delayed? Was it reasonable? Was it a problem? I'm asking because I don't want to add a bunch of complexity and configuration knobs if it's not really a problem, and it's not clear from the discussion how much, if at all, it is a problem.\r\n\r\nThe current behavior seems \"safe\", and I'm also reluctant to add knobs to allow the user to shoot themselves in the foot and perform operations that aren't really safe. Also, if the user doesn't care about consistency, can't they query using a ScanServer instead? If so, it's probably fine if this is what users get when the access a read/write server (tserver).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1422338787/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1422704728","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/3189#issuecomment-1422704728","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/3189","id":1422704728,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5UzMBY","user":{"login":"dlmarion","id":567911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NzkxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/567911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion","html_url":"https://github.com/dlmarion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-08T14:41:35Z","updated_at":"2023-02-08T14:41:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Considering the information about the configuration, I think I'll work on a PR to get rid of server process arguments, and replace them with properties.

I ran a test, going from 2.1.1-SNAPSHOT to 3.0.0-SNAPSHOT using uno and a single tserver.\r\n\r\n* setup 2.1 and 3.0\r\n* started 2.1\r\n* killed the 2.1 manager, all other services running\r\n* started the 3.0 manager \r\n\r\nWhat happened:\r\n\r\n* The upgrade failed because it could not talk to the one tserver and had no host for the metadata table.  It did upgrade ZooKeeper and root but failed at upgrading metadata (trace below)\r\n* The 2.1 tserver remained running, but the manager could not talk to it (AccumuloSecurityException: Error BAD_CREDENTIALS for user !SYSTEM - Username or Password is Invalid) Also, it kept its lock in ZooKeeper\r\n* The gc tried to run, but failed when it could not find replication that was removed as part of the upgrade. \r\n\r\nSo without a \"new\" tserver and the metadata table, the upgrade only partially succeeded and the system is now in an inconsistent state.  If there had been 3.0 tservers, the upgrade would likely have succeeded and the old teserver would not be able to talk with the manager. \r\n\r\nUnsure about the gc.\r\n\r\nIt may be possible to read the table_locks in ZooKeeper and then try to get status from the tservers that are registered there BEFORE starting the upgrade. If that works then we could a) check that the manager can talk to at least one tserver, b) fail the upgrade if any tserver with a registered lock fails a status check, or c) use the min tserver count property to about if there are fewer tservers than specified\r\n\r\nThere are potential issues with either a) or b) approaches.  Starting a cluster with one tserver or a without a substantial portion of tservers might not be the best way to proceed.  If ALL tservers are required, then a transient ZooKeeper error could abort the upgrade unnecessarily.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>3.0 manager upgrade log</summary>\r\n```  \r\n\r\n2023-02-09T15:39:25,298 [manager.EventCoordinator] INFO : State changed from INITIAL to HAVE_LOCK\r\n2023-02-09T15:39:25,303 [upgrade.PreUpgradeValidation] INFO : Starting validation on ZooKeeper ACLs\r\n2023-02-09T15:39:25,368 [upgrade.PreUpgradeValidation] INFO : Successfully completed validation on ZooKeeper ACLs\r\n2023-02-09T15:39:25,375 [upgrade.UpgradeCoordinator] INFO : Upgrading Zookeeper - current version 10 as step towards target version 11\r\n2023-02-09T15:39:25,375 [upgrade.Upgrader10to11] INFO : upgrade of ZooKeeper entries\r\n2023-02-09T15:39:25,415 [manager.EventCoordinator] INFO : Upgrade status changed from INITIAL to UPGRADED_ZOOKEEPER\r\n2023-02-09T15:39:25,415 [metrics.MetricsUtil] INFO : initializing metrics, enabled:false, class:\r\n2023-02-09T15:39:25,427 [metrics.MetricsUtil] INFO : Metric producer FateMetrics initialize\r\n2023-02-09T15:39:25,427 [metrics.ManagerMetrics] INFO : Registered FATE metrics module\r\n2023-02-09T15:39:25,437 [manager.EventCoordinator] INFO : State changed from HAVE_LOCK to NORMAL\r\n2023-02-09T15:39:25,438 [upgrade.UpgradeCoordinator] INFO : Upgrading Root - current version 10 as step towards target version 11\r\n2023-02-09T15:39:25,438 [upgrade.Upgrader10to11] INFO : upgrade root - skipping, nothing to do\r\n2023-02-09T15:39:25,439 [manager.EventCoordinator] INFO : Upgrade status changed from UPGRADED_ZOOKEEPER to UPGRADED_ROOT\r\n2023-02-09T15:39:25,439 [upgrade.UpgradeCoordinator] INFO : Upgrading Metadata - current version 10 as step towards target version 11\r\n2023-02-09T15:39:25,439 [upgrade.Upgrader10to11] INFO : upgrade metadata entries\r\n2023-02-09T15:39:25,446 [manager.Manager] INFO : New servers: [localhost:9997[100002204fb0003]]\r\n2023-02-09T15:39:25,447 [manager.EventCoordinator] INFO : There are now 1 tablet servers\r\n2023-02-09T15:39:25,447 [manager.Manager] INFO : tserver availability check disabled, continuing with-1 servers.

Below are the main 2 ideas I've looked into so far.\r\n\r\n#### 1. We could create a new RFile reader/iterator (for the purposes of this can just call it FencedRFileReader) that can handle multiple ranges to fence what's returned.\r\n\r\nThe idea here is the new FencedRFileReader iterator would take an existing RFile reader as the source and also a list of 1 or more ranges (or no ranges to mean whole file) and then handle transparently iterating, seeking, etc over the file and skipping rows not in a range. There are a couple ways that I thought of to do this:\r\n\r\n- One way is to have FencedRFileReader extend [SeekingFilter](https://github.com/apache/accumulo/blob/b74c97c260d6867f242945ff65e718e5819be229/core/src/main/java/org/apache/accumulo/core/iterators/user/SeekingFilter.java) or something similar and then internally the iterator can just handle advancing between rows and ranges by overriding `getNextKeyHint()`. Essentially it would keep track of the current range and then handle seeking to the next range transparently when the each range is exhausted when calling `next()`. It of course would need to appropriately handle the other methods as well.\r\n\r\n- Another option is is for FencedRFileReader to extend [HeapIterator](https://github.com/apache/accumulo/blob/b74c97c260d6867f242945ff65e718e5819be229/core/src/main/java/org/apache/accumulo/core/iteratorsImpl/system/HeapIterator.java) like the original RFile [reader](https://github.com/apache/accumulo/blob/b74c97c260d6867f242945ff65e718e5819be229/core/src/main/java/org/apache/accumulo/core/file/rfile/RFile.java#L1160) does. The idea I had here is to first create separate RFile readers for each range to fence off an RFile by a single range (ie RangedRFileReader). Then the new FencedRFileReader could add each single RangedRFileReader as a source and since it's a HeapIterator it should handle things automatically across multiple sources.\r\n\r\nA problem I see with this approach of an iterator that handles more than one range is I'm not sure it would work easily because of having to handle implementing methods in [FileSKVIterator](https://github.com/apache/accumulo/blob/b74c97c260d6867f242945ff65e718e5819be229/core/src/main/java/org/apache/accumulo/core/file/FileSKVIterator.java) such as `getFirstKey()` and `getLastKey()`. There are places in the code like [CompactableUtils](https://github.com/apache/accumulo/blob/b74c97c260d6867f242945ff65e718e5819be229/server/tserver/src/main/java/org/apache/accumulo/tserver/tablet/CompactableUtils.java#L111) that use getFirstKey()/getLastKey() and rely on them for decisions and I am not sure if this would break now that there would be multiple ranges. I would need to dig into this more but maybe someone else can comment on this who knows more about the use cases for those methods. I also wonder how things like [Sampling](https://github.com/apache/accumulo/blob/b74c97c260d6867f242945ff65e718e5819be229/core/src/main/java/org/apache/accumulo/core/file/FileSKVIterator.java) would work.\r\n\r\nA plus side is this approach lends itself easily to still just using a single file entry per file in the metadata table and we can just extend the value to also contain a list of ranges for the file.\r\n\r\n#### 2. A second approach could be to only create an RFile reader/iterator that handles a single range and return a new reader for each range when using FileManager to [open](https://github.com/apache/accumulo/blob/b74c97c260d6867f242945ff65e718e5819be229/server/base/src/main/java/org/apache/accumulo/server/fs/FileManager.java#L503) the list of RFiles. \r\n\r\nSo instead of having a single iterator per RFile that handles multiple ranges like described in approach 1, we would just return multiple RFile readers, one for every range specified.\r\n\r\nThe problem I see here is all of the places where we use a list of files each file is only uniquely identified by [TableFile](https://github.com/apache/accumulo/blob/b74c97c260d6867f242945ff65e718e5819be229/core/src/main/java/org/apache/accumulo/core/metadata/TabletFile.java#L141)/StoredTableFile and the key is just the Path of the file. This would obviously not work in this case because we'd have the path duplicated now as there would be multiple readers for the same file. We'd need to update those classes or have a new class to also add a range as well as Path to uniquely identify the file. Updating TableFile to optionally take a Range in addition to the Path and use that for comparison/equality may be good enough here.\r\n\r\nA plus side is methods in FileSKVIterator such as getFirstKey()/getLastKey() may be easy to implement as it's just a subset of the file and since each reader handle a single continous range hopefully code that calls those methods would work without modification (or without as much modification).\r\n\r\nAlso I was thinking this approach may be easier if there was a separate file entry in the metadata table for each range that is associated with an Rfile instead of just a single entry like today and we just update StoredTableFile to take a Range as part of the comparison/equality but we could probably still make it work with a single entry.\r\n\r\nThoughts/Comments?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1427102074/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1427930129","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/3161#issuecomment-1427930129","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/3161","id":1427930129,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5VHHwR","user":{"login":"dlmarion","id":567911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NzkxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/567911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion","html_url":"https://github.com/dlmarion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-13T13:17:42Z","updated_at":"2023-02-13T13:17:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Resolved conflicts and kicked off another full IT build.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1427930129/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1428140608","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/3189#issuecomment-1428140608","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/3189","id":1428140608,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5VH7JA","user":{"login":"EdColeman","id":7047700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDc3MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7047700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman","html_url":"https://github.com/EdColeman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-13T15:28:29Z","updated_at":"2023-02-13T15:28:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I general this looks like a good change.

I can submit a small PR with the changes probably tomorrow.\r\n\r\nI kicked off another full IT so this should be ready to merge if that passes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1435142227/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1435690276","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/3136#issuecomment-1435690276","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/3136","id":1435690276,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5VkuUk","user":{"login":"cshannon","id":123009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzAwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon","html_url":"https://github.com/cshannon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-18T14:35:14Z","updated_at":"2023-02-18T14:35:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Full IT build passed all the tests for this, I also just pushed a PR to update testing instructions for accumulo-classloaders: https://github.com/apache/accumulo-classloaders/pull/17\r\n\r\n@ctubbsii - I think this is ready to merge, did you want to do a final review?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1435690276/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1438564410","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/2466#issuecomment-1438564410","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/2466","id":1438564410,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5VvsA6","user":{"login":"jmark99","id":31573345,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTczMzQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31573345?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmark99","html_url":"https://github.com/jmark99","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmark99/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmark99/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmark99/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmark99/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmark99/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmark99/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmark99/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmark99/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmark99/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-21T14:13:05Z","updated_at":"2023-02-21T14:13:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"After examining ticket, the `isReady` methods successfully perform steps that need to be performed before the execution of the `call` methods.

I didn't mention log4j in my code review, but I don't think log4j is a good enough reason to stop testing these older versions that users could be using.

I'm sure there's lots of transitive dependency version bumps and changes, but since ZK and Hadoop are deployed by users independently from Accumulo (we don't bundle them) and its other dependencies, I think it still makes sense to test with it, so long as the tests are passing.
