appreciate the question. Although the software has been in production use at Yahoo for over 3 years, it was only open sourced as Apache Pulsar more recently and so is still earlier in its lifecycle than some other projects.\r\n\r\nThat said, there is a rapidly growing number of Pulsar users. A number of them are big companies who like its performance and scalability (but who don't like to talk publicly about newer parts of their technology stack), and there are also a growing number of mid-size and even startup companies using it for its flexibility and features. For example there's a large industrial company using it, a well-known consumer electronics company, a large media company, a transportation services startup, and a tax planning company, just to name a few.  (For what it's worth, StackOverflow isn't always an accurate indicator of adoption--I've worked for companies who had several hundred companies using the technology but very little activity on StackOverflow. When there are responsive, knowledgeable alternatives such as a vendor supporting the technology, questions tend to go directly there instead.)\r\n\r\nIt's true that the connector ecosystem is smaller than that of longer-established projects like Kafka, but with the recent release of Pulsar IO (see https://streaml.io/blog/introducing-pulsar-io/), it's become a lot easier for new connectors to be created. At Streamlio we've been working with a number of customers and solutions partners on connectors using that framework, which will also help expand the connector universe. In addition the client options continue to grow--in addition to C++, Java, and Python, there have been recent new additions from the Pulsar community including Go (see https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/en/client-libraries/#go-client and https://github.com/Comcast/pulsar-client-go) and Scala (https://github.com/sksamuel/pulsar4s).\r\n\r\nTo the broader question of whether marketing is the deciding factor in success of new projects, in general marketing isn't the biggest factor in the early days of a project, it's the technology-savvy people who look beyond \"what is a safe choice because lots of other people are doing it\" to adopt new technology based on understanding the differentiation in the technology and connecting that to what matters for them. With that as the foundation, marketing ramps up and helps to scale sharing their stories to the broader set of adopters who are less driven by an understanding of the technology differentiation and more by seeing that other people like them are using it.\r\n\r\nThe great thing about newer projects is how quickly they evolve--without the legacy baggage of design decisions made years ago, they generally outpace older technologies in innovation, which adds fuel to the early adoption fires.

is a great question with a vision to decide future of a product. Let me fill in my thoughts. \r\nAs a user:\r\nI was looking for a very good alternative for Kafka based upon its disadvantages. I am a techie looking for a better product looked into many products available in OpenSource world - ended up with Pulsar based upon its architecture and cloud adoption flexibility. Future lies on how it adopts to changing strategies in software world - Cloud. It is easy for me to launch Pulsar in Bare Metal in Cloud or on a Kubernetes Cluster or on a GKE or AKS etc. Features that are inflight will make Pulsar more robust. I believe Pulsar will make it BIG based on its Architecture and easy to launch.\r\nRegarding SO, I would say the visit is declining phase as many projects are available on IM. Considering my example, I am working on Jpos, Pulsar, reactor-core and Spring. They are available on Slack and Gitter respectively. I felt it is easy to connect like FTF with the leads and community. We can ping directly/work directly in case to solve a issue then and there. I felt this model is more productive. You can join the channel anytime and can search to find whether those questions are answered before like SO. My 2 cents.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/416792455/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/416859701","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/2440#issuecomment-416859701","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/2440","id":416859701,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNjg1OTcwMQ==","user":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-29T07:51:50Z","updated_at":"2018-08-29T07:51:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@jiazhai : when the CI passed, I will merge this PR and will address those comments in a separate PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/416859701/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/416860145","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/2409#issuecomment-416860145","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/2409","id":416860145,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNjg2MDE0NQ==","user":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-29T07:53:24Z","updated_at":"2018-08-29T07:53:24Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@merlimat @david-streamlio @srkukarni what is the current status of this PR?

Tricky part might be the zk-client dependency, but let's see. \r\n\r\n> Another alternative approach, though with more manual intervention, would be to make the user snapshot the zookeeper instance before upgrade. Could be ropey.\r\n\r\nYes, since we're not actually depending on any of these new txn types, I wanted to have the smoothest downgrade path.\r\n\r\n> What about users which are sharing the zk instance for something else and are using the container stuff?\r\n\r\nI wouldn't worry too much about this case of someone's using Pulsar bundled ZK and expecting it to be 3.5.x for some other applications.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/417123976/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/417140833","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/2471#issuecomment-417140833","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/2471","id":417140833,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNzE0MDgzMw==","user":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-29T23:31:37Z","updated_at":"2018-08-29T23:31:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@merlimat : created #2476 for tracking the tasks for interceptors. lets focus on producer/consumer interceptor for this PR.\r\n\r\n> One thing we should consider is to add ReaderInterceptor as well.
