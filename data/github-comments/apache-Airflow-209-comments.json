In examples you've shown above why couldn't you create the `MyAwesomeDataFileTransformer` _inside_ the callable instead?\r\n\r\nSure @ashb. Here is the real use case:\r\n\r\nWe have a lot of different data sources to be imported, transformed and then exported to several destinations. So we tried to decouple our business logic (importing data, transforming it, and then exporting it) from airflow callable functions:\r\n\r\nFirst, we defined a template method to be used as a `PythonOperator` callable:\r\n```python\r\ndef process_data(dataImporter, dataTransformer, dataExporter):\r\n    data = dataImporter.import_data()\r\n    data = dataTransformer.transform_data(data)\r\n    dataExporter.export_data(data)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen we just have to \"inject\" the proper `data_importer`, `data_transformer` and `data_exporter` in our DAG task (without having to write a new callable function when the data source is changing or the transformation needs some more parameters...)\r\nlet's look at some simple examples:\r\n```python\r\ntask1 = PythonOperator(\r\n    task_id='task_1',\r\n    python_callable=process_data,\r\n    op_args=[\r\n        SomeFileDataImporter('/tmp/{{ ds }}/input_data'),\r\n        SomeDataTransformer(some_value, 'path/to/other/file/{{ ds }}/file'),\r\n        SomeFileDataExporter('/data/output/{{ dag.dag_id }}/output_file')\r\n    ],\r\n    dag=dag\r\n)\r\n\r\ntask2 = PythonOperator(\r\n    task_id='task_2',\r\n    python_callable=process_data,\r\n    op_args=[\r\n        SomeJoiningCsvFilesDataImporter(\r\n            '/tmp/{{ ds }}/input_data_1',\r\n            '/tmp/{{ ds }}/input_data_2',\r\n            join_on='id'\r\n        ),\r\n        SomeOtherDataTransformer(some_value),\r\n        SomeOtherDataExporter(execution_ts={{ ts }})\r\n    ],\r\n    dag=dag\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis approach has several benefits:\r\n\r\n- separation of concerns: the callable function does not need to know how to import data (it could come from one file, several files, a database, an API, etc...), how to transform it and how to export it.\r\n- respect single responsibility principle: we separate responsibilities in simple classes: a pickle file importer, a json file importer, a sql importer, etc... \r\n- use DAG declaration as an IOC tool: we just inject proper implementations, depending on each use case. When another transformation is required, just inject another data_transformer implementation without having to write another callable function. We do not want the callable function being responsible to instantiate the right implementation.\r\n\r\nTo make this approach work properly, we would like operators to be able to render nested template fields.\r\n\r\nThe `template_fields` solution may have some limitation (as [pointed out](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4743#issuecomment-472735428) by @bjoernpollex-sc), but it would answer some needed use cases.\r\n\r\nI also suggested [adding another `render_template` hook function](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4743#issuecomment-472996201) that people could implement to solve custom template rendering issues. Would it answer your concerns about this submitted pull request?\r\n\r\nThank you for taking time to read this\r\ncheers","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/473318089/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/473340396","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3719#issuecomment-473340396","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3719","id":473340396,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MzM0MDM5Ng==","user":{"login":"manugarri","id":3670355,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzAzNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3670355?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manugarri","html_url":"https://github.com/manugarri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manugarri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manugarri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manugarri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manugarri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manugarri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manugarri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manugarri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manugarri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manugarri/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-15T15:53:21Z","updated_at":"2019-03-15T15:53:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I

I saw you have finished changes on **scheduler and lineage**. I think I could focus on codes on **tutorial and concepts**. \r\nThus, in this PR, I will \r\n1) only extract codes on **tutorial and concepts**.\r\n2) extract all code snippets, not only DAGs. \r\nIs it good?\r\n\r\nAs for second step, we could create a new PR to add tests for all those examples. \r\n\r\nBesides, I have some questions:\r\n1. Some code fragments are not a DAG file, such as [Kubernetes Operato](https://github.com/PolideaInternal/airflow/pull/77/files#diff-c63bdbf4e38e4a44b9023b6d79aba6d5), is example_dags a good place for those code?\r\n2. Some code fragments are not complete, such as [dependency description](https://airflow.apache.org/concepts.html#bitshift-composition), is it necessary to extract such code?\r\n\r\nThank you very much!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/473542322/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/473556967","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4895#issuecomment-473556967","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4895","id":473556967,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MzU1Njk2Nw==","user":{"login":"zhongjiajie","id":15820530,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODIwNTMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15820530?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie","html_url":"https://github.com/zhongjiajie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-16T16:09:17Z","updated_at":"2019-03-16T16:09:17Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"After today work, I think this PR is ready to review.

Thanks for comments :) really appreciate! \r\n\r\nI like that you liked breeze. We find our version of breeze pretty indispensable for our daily work. \r\n\r\n> Remove the tox from .flake8\r\n\r\nWill do. Good catch.\r\n\r\n> Why are all the versions changed in airflow/www/package-lock.json, maybe revert this? I see also that we're going back to lower versions. What do you think?\r\n\r\nAlready reverted. That was automatically done by 'npm install'. This is the default behaviour of NPM and something that maybe long term we would like to have with setup.py/requirements - exactly what I advocated for some time ago - have a fixed set of deps (lock) and update them automatically during development (npm install) so that it can be committed and used in CI environment ('npm ci'). I find this workflow very stable. But that's a side comment. We have something similar now with the layered build (as the requirements are frozen in CI image in-between setup.py changes). Something that we should discuss if community is fine with. I will re-open the discussion as I am ready to do so.\r\n\r\n> Personally I would leave the .bash_aliases and the .inputrc out, since these settings are personal preferences.\r\n\r\nNo problem, I will remove them, though I love to have those inside the docker. What I can do instead, I can implement conditional mounting of those two in case I place those files in a specific directory from sources. This way I can keep them \"local\" for myself but still get them used every time I enter the environment.\r\n\r\n> For the go docker-show-context stuff, shoudn't we able to use a binary, instead of adding the source to the Airflow repository.\r\n\r\nI just removed it. I needed that only temporarily while I debugged some missing .dockerignores. I found a better solution now with the docker-show-all-context-files, which is kinda nice - it is controlled with an environment variable and it will save list of all files that are in Docker context in a file in \"dist\" directory. It's kind a smart and super-simple (found it on Stack Overflow somewhere)- it creates an empty container with the same context and lists all files from the container :)\r\n\r\n> What do you think of adding hadolint to the pre-steps of the CI?\r\n\r\nGreat idea. I will give it a spin! Looks cool.\r\n\r\n> Further thoughts, ideally we should have one image for testing Airflow. So in that case we should deprecate https://github.com/apache/airflow-ci and use this image for testing as well.\r\n\r\nAbsolutely. This is what already happens in this change and one of the biggest reasons to implement it. The CI scripts are building the image locally (using cache from DockerHub and local sources to incrementally add latest sources/or packages - whatever has changed) and then use those locally built images to run the tests (not the incubator-ci one)\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/473731432/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/473732065","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4543#issuecomment-473732065","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4543","id":473732065,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MzczMjA2NQ==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-18T00:32:25Z","updated_at":"2019-03-18T00:32:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@fokko @ash - one more comment - I am now ready to involve community. I actually managed to hugely simplify the layer structure. I did a lot of testing - including all the timing calculation - how much we save at each stage, whether the layers are needed, whether the wheel cache layer is really helping. All this is documented now in https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/AIP-10+Multi-layered+and+multi-stage+official+Airflow+image\r\n\r\nFrom those tests it seems that wheel cache did more harm than good. It complicated the whole setup and increased number of images we had to build and eventually only provided marginal savings. It took much longer to build the images  in general (bigger Dockerfile, more layers etc.). Also when I disabled CYTHON compilation for Cassandra driver, pip installation time went down by 5(!) minutes or so and then it started to be comparable with the installation from wheels. \r\n\r\nSo my most recent proposal is even more simplified - we now have only three stages in the Dockerfile and two images in DockerHub (just the slim Airflow Image and fat Airflow CI image). And it's also a bit easier to explain and understand.\r\n\r\nI will explain it in the community devlist email.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/473732065/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/473732802","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4891#issuecomment-473732802","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4891","id":473732802,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MzczMjgwMg==","user":{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-18T00:40:06Z","updated_at":"2019-03-18T00:40:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I

I can. I imagine it's a a pain for reviewers to review it all. I am quite used to split and join vomits and re-arrange branches as needed. So this should be no big problem. It actually make sense to split it as some of the changes might wait until all the tests are fixed.\r\n\r\nI already thought about it and I think this approach might make sense:\r\n\r\n1) first replace the original Docker with the multi-layered one (plus accompanying .ignore files) - the Dockerfile will build stand-alone and in DockerHub and will produce similar Docker image as we have currently. I can even extract out the CI-relevant stage and submit it at later PR \r\n\r\n2) then as next PR I can add hook/build scripts that will add custom build in DockerHub and produce both CI And Airflow images - at this time I could add the CI stage back. \r\n\r\n3) next PR would be to change tests to use the new Dockerfile/images to run Travis tests. \r\n\r\n4) final PR (which i already split to separate PR) is the improved development environment. \r\n\r\nIt will be difficult to split it to more granular changes I am afraid, but having those four PRs might actually make sense - also it might make it easier to introduce it - we can check step by step that things work/reconfigure the DockerHub gradually and verify that it works fine. \r\n\r\nDo you think such split will address your concern? Or you thought about more incremental approach ? \r\n\r\n@fokko @ashb - what do you think ?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/474049231/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/474060652","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4935#issuecomment-474060652","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4935","id":474060652,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NDA2MDY1Mg==","user":{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-18T19:11:31Z","updated_at":"2019-03-18T19:11:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"```\r\n======================================================================\r\n97)
