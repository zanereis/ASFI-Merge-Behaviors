thanks very much for the review! I believe I've addressed all the concerns you raised. The only one I feel certain might merit more attention is the question of MatchAllDocs special-case, which I've adapted to now not (ever?) hit the filterCache, in 1e6cfeffbabd400b37afe8af8c1bc29d45d8de79. That allowed to revert some of the test workarounds (including a preexisting workaround related to pure-negative filters). Keeping MatchAllDocs off the `filterCache` is I think more generally a Good Thing -- in fact the change addressed an [existing TODO comment](https://github.com/apache/solr/blob/cb2e58f6569704c45387a8d094625ba8e014776b/solr/core/src/java/org/apache/solr/search/SolrIndexSearcher.java#L869).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1030362953/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1030383561","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/592#issuecomment-1030383561","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/592","id":1030383561,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM49amfJ","user":{"login":"madrob","id":1592330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTIzMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1592330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/madrob","html_url":"https://github.com/madrob","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madrob/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madrob/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madrob/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madrob/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madrob/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madrob/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madrob/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madrob/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madrob/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-04T22:00:12Z","updated_at":"2022-02-04T22:00:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yea, I'm super excited about this, it's starting to look like a pretty nice boost to what we do!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1030383561/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1030443616","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/596#issuecomment-1030443616","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/596","id":1030443616,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM49a1Jg","user":{"login":"janhoy","id":409128,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTEyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/409128?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy","html_url":"https://github.com/janhoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-04T23:54:07Z","updated_at":"2022-02-04T23:54:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Did a bunch of 8_11 mappings, now there are only 25 pages left without a mapping.

In turn, it will pass them both to `aggregateResults`. This way `aggregateResults` will always get non null `backupManager` and `backupProperties` values, so it will be safe to extract necessary data from it. First of all we will get `startTime` (before it was `null` for snapshot backups). \r\n\r\nSecond, let's compare shard responses of incremental and snapshot backups:\r\n\r\nIncremental:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n        \"response\": {\r\n            \"startTime\": \"2022-02-04T12:35:52.304582700Z\",\r\n            \"indexFileCount\": 21,\r\n            \"uploadedIndexFileCount\": 21,\r\n            \"indexSizeMB\": 0.006,\r\n            \"uploadedIndexFileMB\": 0.006,\r\n            \"shard\": \"shard1\",\r\n            \"endTime\": \"2022-02-04T12:35:52.348963900Z\",\r\n            \"shardBackupId\": \"md_shard1_0\"\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSnapshot:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n        \"response\": {\r\n            \"startTime\": \"Wed Feb 09 07:25:51 UTC 2022\",\r\n            \"fileCount\": 21,\r\n            \"status\": \"success\",\r\n            \"snapshotCompletedAt\": \"Wed Feb 09 07:25:51 UTC 2022\",\r\n            \"snapshotName\": \"shard1\",\r\n            \"directoryName\": \"snapshot.shard1\"\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThey are not equal, but have something in common. We can aggregate results from both of them. For example, we can unify `indexFileCount` and `uploadedIndexFileCount` of incremental backup and `fileCount` of snapshot backup. Since snapshot is not incremental by its nature, we can fill both `indexFileCount` and `uploadedIndexFileCount` of aggregated result with `fileCount` value.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of aggregated results of the snapshot backup response (before and after changes applied):\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n    \"response\": {\r\n        \"collection\": \"techproducts\",\r\n        \"numShards\": 2,\r\n        \"endTime\": \"2022-02-09T07:25:52.879269500Z\"\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n    \"response\": {\r\n        \"collection\": \"techproducts\",\r\n        \"numShards\": 2,\r\n        \"backupId\": -1,\r\n        \"indexVersion\": \"9.0.0\",\r\n        \"startTime\": \"2022-02-09T19:16:10.082015800Z\",\r\n        \"indexFileCount\": 22,\r\n        \"uploadedIndexFileCount\": 22,\r\n        \"endTime\": \"2022-02-09T19:16:11.191537400Z\"\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that for snapshot backups value of `backupId` will be always `-1`\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1034127420/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1034132999","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/595#issuecomment-1034132999","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/595","id":1034132999,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM49o54H","user":{"login":"ijioio","id":62468619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNDY4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62468619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijioio","html_url":"https://github.com/ijioio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijioio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijioio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijioio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijioio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijioio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijioio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijioio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijioio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijioio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-09T19:49:01Z","updated_at":"2022-02-09T19:49:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Just

Thank you for the comments!\r\n\r\n> Could it also be confusing for users to have both indexFileCount and uploadedIndexFileCount values instead of the one fileCount value? I'm curious though why it's called fileCount and not indexFileCount in the snapshot i.e. would a snapshot after an incremental backup not have the same count for both (assuming no changes in the interim)?\r\n\r\nYes, I agree! After I have pushed changes I thought the same :) We can expose only `fileCount` single field for snapshot backups. It is not a problem. Even better, we can use `indexFileCount` field to exactly express the nature of the content. This way aggregated result for incremental backups will contain both `indexFileCount` and `uploadedIndexFileCount`, while snapshot backups will only contain `indexFileCount` field.\r\n\r\n> Hmm, subjectively no backup id seems clearer than a backup id of -1 value, but that's just me.\r\n\r\nOK. We can exclude it. Value `-1` is just a value that is assigned for non incremental backups within `BackupManager.forBackup` call:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n      BackupManager backupMgr = (incremental) ?\r\n              BackupManager.forIncrementalBackup(repository, ccc.getZkStateReader(), backupUri) :\r\n              BackupManager.forBackup(repository, ccc.getZkStateReader(), backupUri);\r\n```\r\n\r\n> Not connected to any specific response element(s), do we know what backwards compatibility considerations apply here and/or any thoughts on how to communicate changes to users? E.g. additional elements likely would not break existing usage of the JSON but renaming or removal of existing elements might.\r\n\r\nYou are absolutely right! The most pleasant thing here we are not going to change any shard's responses format. We are going to extend aggregated result content for snapshot backups only. Initially it is quite poor:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"response\": {\r\n    \"collection\": \"techproducts\",\r\n    \"numShards\": 2,\r\n    \"endTime\": \"2022-02-09T07:25:52.879269500Z\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nso we can extend it any way we want without worrying about breaking some backward compatibility.

Also, both snapshot and incremental backup request responses will now contain `starTime` and `endTime`. Here is an example of how collection's snapshot backup request responses will looks like:\r\n\r\nIncremental:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"response\": {\r\n    \"collection\": \"techproducts\",\r\n    \"numShards\": 2,\r\n    \"backupId\": 0,\r\n    \"indexVersion\": \"9.0.0\",\r\n    \"startTime\": \"2022-02-11T17:20:44.157305500Z\",\r\n    \"indexFileCount\": 22,\r\n    \"uploadedIndexFileCount\": 22,\r\n    \"indexSizeMB\": 0.007,\r\n    \"uploadedIndexFileMB\": 0.007,\r\n    \"shardBackupIds\": [\r\n        \"md_shard2_0\",\r\n        \"md_shard1_0\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"endTime\": \"2022-02-11T17:20:45.245534400Z\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSnapshot:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"response\": {\r\n    \"collection\": \"techproducts\",\r\n    \"numShards\": 2,\r\n    \"indexVersion\": \"9.0.0\",\r\n    \"startTime\": \"2022-02-11T17:19:33.271461700Z\",\r\n    \"indexFileCount\": 22,\r\n    \"endTime\": \"2022-02-11T17:19:34.363859100Z\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSnapshot backup shard's response were updated to add fields `indexFileCount` and `endTime`, snapshot delete shard's response were updated to add fields `startTime` and `endTime`. Previous fields `fileCount`, `snapshotCompletedAt` and `snapshotDeletedAt` of backup and delete shard's responses are now deprecated and will be removed in future releases. All date/time fields of backup and delete related shard's responses have been updated to use `Instance` instead of `Date`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1037068373/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1037254994","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/553#issuecomment-1037254994","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/553","id":1037254994,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM4900FS","user":{"login":"risdenk","id":3384157,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzODQxNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3384157?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk","html_url":"https://github.com/risdenk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-12T15:19:12Z","updated_at":"2022-02-12T15:19:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"So I pushed changes that address most of the review comments so far.
