The isolation scheduler lets you specify which topologies should be \"isolated\", meaning that they run on a dedicated set of machines within the cluster where no other topologies will be running. These isolated topologies are given priority on the cluster, so resources will be allocated to isolated topologies if there's competition with non-isolated topologies, and resources will be taken away from non-isolated topologies if necessary to get resources for an isolated topology. Once all isolated topologies are allocated, the remaining machines on the cluster are shared among all non-isolated topologies.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +You configure the isolation scheduler in the Nimbus configuration. Set \"storm.scheduler\" to \"org.apache.storm.scheduler.IsolationScheduler\". Then, use the \"isolation.scheduler.machines\" config to specify how many machines each topology should get.
