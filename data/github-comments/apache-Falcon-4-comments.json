To follow up with our talk, our current CLI framework doesn't check whether an option is used in a command or not, i.e. they are all optional. In other words, whether I add an option or not doesn't change your extension repository results, if you don't use these options. For example, \"bin/falcon extension -enumerate -url http://localhost:15000 -d -ddd \" gives the same result as \"bin/falcon extension -enumerate -url http://localhost:15000\".\n\nThis resembles with REST api design, i.e. it won't throw error if user pass an unrecognized parameter.
