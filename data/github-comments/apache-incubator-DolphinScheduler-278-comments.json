@caishunfeng, IMO, the streaming task support needs to introduce event based scheduling mechanism in scheduler. Current scheduling mechanism depends on the status of the task, but streaming task is long running. cc @davidzollo ,@EricGao888\r\n\r\n@SteNicholas  Thanks your reply, I'm agree with you, and I think it's a big feature too. In this feature,  stream task will do nothing when workflow running, so maybe they don't conflict, we can follow up to  introduce event based scheduling,
