you cannot just update the krb5.conf those are just recommendations on the client side. The KDC both with MIT Krb5 and Active Directory control the max_renewable_lifetime via /var/kerberos/krb5kdc/kdc.conf and settings in Windows registry.  My co-worker and I tested this today and the ticket is still renewable because the KDC controls the max time and it looks as if Java takes info from the KDC... Using the CLI kinit/klist and hadoop fs the ticket is expired.

Downloading spark in zeppelin-deamons.sh doesn't make sense to me. Because some users may not use spark in zeppelin, they may only use jdbc or other interpreters. And even for some users that use spark, they may not have internet access, then they will fail to start zeppelin. Personally I prefer to defer the downloading. E.g. we can download it at the first time of running spark interpreter. If user don't specify SPARK_HOME, then we either can download it in backend and display proper message in frontend or just display error message in frontend that asking user to download spark manually and specify SPARK_HOME.\r\n\r\n2. Running unit test for PySparkInterpreter & SparkRInterpreter. Running them require correct configuration of PYTHONPATH (pyspark.zip & py4j) and SparkRLibPath (sparkr.zip). For now, we downloading spark in pom.xml and set them properly in pom.xml. But in your PR, you set it in travis script, this would make running these unit test locally difficult, especially for new contributor if they don't know the underlying mechanisms.  My suggestion is that we can download it programatically [SparkDownloadUtils](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/zeppelin-zengine/src/test/java/org/apache/zeppelin/interpreter/SparkDownloadUtils.java) and set java property `spark.home` to pass to PySparkInterpreter & SparkRInterpreter and we treat the same `spark.home` & `SPARK_HOME` in [PytonUtils](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/spark/interpreter/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/spark/PythonUtils.java) (Because we can not set enviroment variable programmatically). In this case, we can run unit test of PySparkInterpreter & SparkRInterpreter easily without any extra configuration. \r\n\r\n\\cc @felixcheung @Leemoonsoo
