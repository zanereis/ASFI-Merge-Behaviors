Auto commit on the spout, and number of ackers configured for Storm (https://storm.apache.org/releases/1.0.0/javadocs/org/apache/storm/Config.html#TOPOLOGY_ACKER_EXECUTORS). You can configure Storm to require tuple acking, while also using auto commit for this spout, in which case the spout will retry tuples that fail, but only on a best-effort basis (i.e. if the spout crashes, tuples will not be replayed). In that case, the spout actually needs to track tuples even though auto commit is on. You can also set acker executors to 0, which will cause Storm to just ack tuples immediately when emitted. In that case it doesn't hurt anything if the spout adds tuples to emitted, because they'll just get removed again when ack() is called.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/278090482/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/278091708","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1919#issuecomment-278091708","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1919","id":278091708,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3ODA5MTcwOA==","user":{"login":"revans2","id":3441321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDEzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3441321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2","html_url":"https://github.com/revans2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-07T18:18:17Z","updated_at":"2017-02-07T18:18:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This is the thing with auto-commit.  auto-commit removes some of the overhead of tracking outstanding messages, but also violates a lot of the guarantees that storm has in place.\r\n\r\nTo truly get at most once processing you need to commit the message as soon as it is emitted.   Otherwise a crash can still result in messages being replayed.  If you want at least once processing you have to ack the message only after it is fully processed.  Storm makes this work out of the box for most spouts that commit the message when ack is called.\r\n\r\nWith auto-commit it makes it so we could replay messages even in at most once processing and that we might not replay messages in at least once processing.

It is reading from shared memory, no system call needed.  It can be different if read from different threads even.  nanoTime, at least on x86 boxes end up reading a special register in the processor.  If there is a very small core count this is cheap.  However if you are on a system with many different cores or physical chips they all have to be synced up to guarantee that it is monotonically increasing so it ends up being about as expensive as a memory barrier.  Not super expensive but also not dead cheap.\r\n\r\nAs far as Time.java is concerned.  Simulated time can be whatever we want.  I don't care if we store nanos internally or millis internally.  It is all simulated anyways.  If we are not simulating I don't think we should mix the two or have one backed by the other.  They are separate for a reason and people most of the time will pick one or the other because of those differences.  If we want nano support then lest have Time support nano, but the milli APIs stay backed by System.currentTimeMillis, and the nano APIs are backed by System.nanoTime.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/278478555/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/278507941","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1832#issuecomment-278507941","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1832","id":278507941,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3ODUwNzk0MQ==","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-09T00:27:29Z","updated_at":"2017-02-09T00:28:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Let's back to actual usage of Timer.\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (!consumerAutoCommitMode) {     // If it is auto commit, no need to commit offsets manually\r\n    commitTimer = new Timer(500, kafkaSpoutConfig.getOffsetsCommitPeriodMs(), TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);\r\n}\r\nrefreshSubscriptionTimer = new Timer(500, kafkaSpoutConfig.getPartitionRefreshPeriodMs(), TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere we are taking period as milliseconds consistently, and dropping support nanoseconds on Timer means that up to 1 ms can be added to the period.

You should raise an issue at https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM so the fix can be tracked.

You should also open a PR for master first, then the fix can be cherry picked back to 1.x-branch once it goes in.\r\n\r\nAbout the contents of this PR: I think getting rid of kafka-unit is a good idea. It uses deprecated Kafka APIs. That said, I'd prefer if we could replace it with something similar since we're likely going to be using embedded Kafka for other tests in the future, and copy-pasting code to other test classes would get tedious. Would you be up for wrapping the setup/teardown code for the Kafka broker in a junit TestRule (https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/wiki/Rules#custom-rules)?
