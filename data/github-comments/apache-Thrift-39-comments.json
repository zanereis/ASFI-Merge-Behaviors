Without using the callback interface, when calling write, the message will be put into some internal queues. This means that if a disconnect happens there will be no transparency over what was delivered and what was left pending into internal queues. \r\n\r\nThe solution is to use the callback interface for the `Socket.write` method, thus ensuring transparency over what get's delivered and what not. The `offline_queue` managed by this client adds yet another layer of queuing, which doesn't bring many benefits for the complexity it introduces so it should be avoided. This is however another discussion, which will require a bigger change.\r\n\r\nThis PR is meant to address a smaller issue in regards to the current implementation, which I think could be merged until a bigger redesign would be ready.

Using a slice and enforcing uniqueness via `reflect.DeepEqual` provides a better user experience.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/493491160/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/493494597","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/1802#issuecomment-493494597","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/1802","id":493494597,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MzQ5NDU5Nw==","user":{"login":"johnboiles","id":218876,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxODg3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/218876?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnboiles","html_url":"https://github.com/johnboiles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnboiles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnboiles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnboiles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnboiles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnboiles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnboiles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnboiles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnboiles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnboiles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-17T15:25:24Z","updated_at":"2019-05-17T15:25:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Good to know.

It doesn't seem to [do anything](https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/compiler/cpp/src/thrift/generate/t_go_generator.cc#L375) except affect whether native (int/string/bool/double) types are pointers or not. In the case of map/slice it currently also forces those to be pointers pointer types when they don't have a default value, but since maps and slices are already pointers, I don't think this has any practical effect.\r\n- @dcelasun what do you think about merging this change first to fix compilation without making an API-incompatible change.

Ping\r\nSorry for the late reply. I've replied a comment in the ticket, and here is a digest:\r\n1. It's fine to reinitialize protocol/transport stack from scratch, but might not close sockets as subsequent requests(maybe another thrift method that works fine) could re-use them. Opening a lot sockets consume a lot resources and could easily lead to Socket Exceptions.\r\n2. If this is an issue, it exist in both client side and server side, my fix is in client side. I need to dive more into source code to see how to fix it in server side, probably Server.Execute() as you suggest.\r\nAny more suggestion is welcome.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/503828987/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/504338821","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/1757#issuecomment-504338821","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/1757","id":504338821,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNDMzODgyMQ==","user":{"login":"mustafa-cosar","id":19838154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5ODM4MTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19838154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mustafa-cosar","html_url":"https://github.com/mustafa-cosar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mustafa-cosar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mustafa-cosar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mustafa-cosar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mustafa-cosar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mustafa-cosar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mustafa-cosar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mustafa-cosar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mustafa-cosar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mustafa-cosar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-21T08:22:55Z","updated_at":"2019-06-21T08:23:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I kicked the failing job which had some java-cpp cross test timeouts.\r\n\r\n@jeking3 The travis build is green, but appveyor failed at the start.
