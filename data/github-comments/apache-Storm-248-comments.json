We were doing it previously for the logs dir anyways, it should be simple to extend this and just disable the symlink when configured to do so.</p>\n\n<p>For the blob store we have a bit of a bigger problem.  The <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/storm-core/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/localizer/Localizer.java\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Localizer</a> sets up a chain of symlinks so that the old data downloaded from the blob store can remain in place until the new data is downloaded and ready.  At that point it will update one of the sym-links in the chain to atomically point it to the new location of the data.  There is some redundancy in the links that we could probably remove, but the path currently stands as</p>\n\n<div class=\"code panel\" style=\"border-width: 1px;\"><div class=\"codeContent panelContent\">\n<pre class=\"code-java\">${worker_pwd}/${link_name} -> ${topology_code_dir}/${link_name} -> ${localizer_cache}/${user}/.../${key}.current -> ${localizer_cache}/${user}/.../${key}.${version}\n</pre>\n</div></div>\n\n<p>If we removed all of the symlinks in some cases we would need another way/API for the user to be able to get the current list of blob paths to access.  We currently don't have a communication path from the supervisor to the worker.  We would need to add this in, along with some book keeping so we can know which blob version is the current one.  We don't always rely on the version number to be atomically incrementing, just different from what we already have cached.  Any high level API that we do add, would need to work both with sym-links and without sym-links consistently.  Essentially it would need two implementations one that relies on sym-links so when a sym-link changes the API returns the correct thing, and another that just reads from this new communication path.</p>\n\n<p>There are a number of other features in the works that build on top of this functionality that would also need some rework.  <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-2016\" title=\"Topology submission improvement: support adding local jars and maven artifacts on submission\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-2016\"><del>STORM-2016</del></a> takes jars on the client and adds them to the blobstore/classpath for the worker (removes the requirement for an uber-jar).</p>\n\n<p>I also know that <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=jerrypeng\" class=\"user-hover\" rel=\"jerrypeng\">Boyang Jerry Peng</a> has been working on a few things that would allow you to change configs as part of a topology rebalance, although it is very preliminary.  It also has the potential to also update a topology's jar, or combined with <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-2016\" title=\"Topology submission improvement: support adding local

relaunching it.</p>\n\n<p>None of this makes this work impossible, just not trivial.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612946663/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612929319","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/5767#issuecomment-2612929319","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/5767","id":2612929319,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI5MjkzMTk=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-15T18:01:41Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T16:29:29Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a
