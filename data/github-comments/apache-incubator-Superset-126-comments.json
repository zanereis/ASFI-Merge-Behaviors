is a wrapper around `react-virtualized` which plays nice tricks to only render what's in the viewport, allowing to render (fake-render really) large datasets which was a requirement for SQL Lab. It's one of those who fake a table (it's not an html `<table>`) so it doesn't know how to scale the width of columns like the normal html `<table>` do. We have to provide hard coded widths somehow for this to work. There's code somewhere that figure out pixels width given a html snippet which is a bit borderline hacky but there are no ways around that I can think of.\r\n\r\nPersonally I like the `reactable` api, allowing to just `<Table data={data} />` but also going down to `Tr` `Td` where/when needed. It's also proper html `<table>` which have good properties and style properly when passing the proper bootstrap classes (`table table-bordered table-condensed ...`).\r\n\r\nI think we may need both of these ^^^\r\n\r\nNow you missed `react-bootstrap-table` which can be replaced by `reactable`. This should be pretty easy to do. Here: `javascripts/dashboard/components/SliceAdder.jsx`\r\n\r\nClearly datatables is the non-react weird old jQuery one here that we should kill. It's also pretty big in our bundles, I did some work around removing the dependency, but there's still the `table` and `pivot_table` visualizations that we need to fix up.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/374467332/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/374472020","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/4643#issuecomment-374472020","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/4643","id":374472020,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NDQ3MjAyMA==","user":{"login":"williaster","id":4496521,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0OTY1MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4496521?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster","html_url":"https://github.com/williaster","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-20T04:37:47Z","updated_at":"2018-03-20T04:37:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"yeah I agree this will def be confused for a stacked area chart / is pretty misleading as is. \r\n\r\nto improve it you could try to mirror this ggplot example by\r\n- making them super transparent to ensure that you can see the overlapping lines \r\n- have the area stroke goes down to _zero_ even if the y-value does not (ie add a stroke around the entire area). this is true in the ggplot example

It seems that the convention is that it's assumed that these configuration variables exist and thus I'm uncertain whether the check is required.\r\n\r\nBefore this PR, the behaviour of `superset flower` on a missing broker config was to invoke:\r\n\r\n    celery flower --broker=None --port=5555 --address=localhost\r\n\r\nWhich resulted in the following output:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[I 180320 14:16:57 command:139] Visit me at http://localhost:5555\r\n[I 180320 14:16:57 command:144] Broker: amqp://guest:**@None:5672//\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this PR, but without the check, the resulting command on a missing broker config would be:\r\n\r\n    celery flower -A superset.cli.celery_app --port=5555 --address=localhost\r\n\r\nWith the output:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2018-03-20 14:24:48,106:INFO:flower.command:Visit me at http://localhost:5555\r\n2018-03-20 14:24:48,111:INFO:flower.command:Broker: amqp://guest:**@localhost:5672//\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn both cases `flower` guessed wrongly that there is a broker configured using AMQP, and accessing port 5555 in the browser results in a page that never finishes loading.\r\n\r\nI think it would be better to just fail early in this case.\r\n\r\nAs for the deprecation of external command wrapping, if you believe that there is little value in fixing the flower invocation, feel free to close this PR, but as long as there is a `superset flower` command, I'd rather it did the right thing.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/374687104/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/374697547","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/4646#issuecomment-374697547","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/4646","id":374697547,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NDY5NzU0Nw==","user":{"login":"jeffreythewang","id":3317634,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTc2MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3317634?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreythewang","html_url":"https://github.com/jeffreythewang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreythewang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreythewang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreythewang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreythewang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreythewang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreythewang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreythewang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreythewang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreythewang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-20T17:59:56Z","updated_at":"2018-03-20T20:21:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've
