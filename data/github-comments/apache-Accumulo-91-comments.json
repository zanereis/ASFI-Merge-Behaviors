There is an open question as to whether or not we should add this utility to the `accumulo` command. Based on the comments above and a discussion with @EdColeman, I am of the opinion that the utility should be removed. As described [here](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r3.3.3/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HdfsDesign.html#Replica_Placement:_The_First_Baby_Steps) the write pipeline will put a replica on the local machine if the writer is on a datanode. Blocks for a file will only be local if a compaction has occurred and *all* of the following are true:\r\n\r\n  1. The TabletServer is running on a host with a DataNode\r\n  2. The Tablet has not been re-hosted on a different TabletServer on a different host.\r\n  3. In the case of a External Compaction, the Compactor running the compaction is on the same host as the Tablets' TabletServer.\r\n  4. The Hadoop configuration does not use a  [block placement policy](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r3.3.3/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HdfsBlockPlacementPolicies.html) that does not place a block local to the writer.\r\n  5. Erasure Coding is not being used.\r\n  6. The HDFS balancer has not moved any of the files blocks from the local node.\r\n  \r\nIf we are going to keep the utility, then I think we should merge this PR so that all utilities operate in the same manner.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1192889478/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1194107775","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/2824#issuecomment-1194107775","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/2824","id":1194107775,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5HLKN_","user":{"login":"EdColeman","id":7047700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDc3MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7047700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman","html_url":"https://github.com/EdColeman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-25T14:16:02Z","updated_at":"2022-07-25T14:16:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Making `lastMemoryCheckTime` private changes the current behavior.

GarbageCollectionLogger is now only referenced 11 times, while the new class is 29.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1201276098/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1201294164","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/2827#issuecomment-1201294164","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/2827","id":1201294164,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5HmktU","user":{"login":"EdColeman","id":7047700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDc3MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7047700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman","html_url":"https://github.com/EdColeman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-01T14:39:29Z","updated_at":"2022-08-01T14:39:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The rename was a suggestion by @milleruntime \r\n\r\n```\r\n...I think the name of this class is confusing.

took some screenshots on main and this branch and noticed some differences. Some changes can probably stay how they are, others we might want to correct.\r\n\r\n**On the home page:**\r\n\r\nmain:\r\n![Screenshot from 2022-08-04 11-00-23](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47725857/182904627-98dd69d3-a9e3-4843-acdb-52272663c42e.png)\r\n\r\nthis branch:\r\n![Screenshot from 2022-08-04 10-25-50](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47725857/182904693-583be5ff-fa58-4a35-aaed-60f38ba25691.png)\r\n\r\nThe overview table should probably be returned to center. Also, there is a white bar at the top of every page for some reason on this branch that should probably be removed.\r\n\r\n**On the manager page:**\r\n\r\nmain:\r\n![Screenshot from 2022-08-04 11-00-54](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47725857/182905520-5fda384c-b211-42b8-aeb3-8a263c1fbc5d.png)\r\n\r\nthis branch:\r\n![Screenshot from 2022-08-04 10-26-11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47725857/182905532-d9857c76-5d2f-4f9a-864e-b84ad3f2a2a1.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt looks like the table titles appear below the table which should probably be moved back above the table. This might be the new default for DataTables, but it might be better if the titles are at the top of the tables.\r\n\r\n**Dropdown menus:**\r\n\r\nmain:\r\n![Screenshot from 2022-08-04 11-01-14](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47725857/182906101-b8e469b9-1f02-41e4-94c0-6a36e3006221.png)\r\n\r\nthis branch:\r\n![Screenshot from 2022-08-04 10-26-25](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47725857/182906116-78c281b7-1ee4-4d37-987b-a3624166219b.png)\r\n\r\nIt looks like the text for the menu options is running outside of its background on this branch. Also, the button that was clicked to bring down this dropdown menu (`Servers` in this case) is not highlighted anymore.\r\n\r\n**The info modal:**\r\n\r\nmain:\r\n![Screenshot from 2022-08-04 11-02-01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47725857/182906517-c5c31c37-85dc-478a-8688-bfebb83e0ffd.png)\r\n\r\nthis branch:\r\n![Screenshot from 2022-08-04 10-27-13](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47725857/182906538-40c797e1-5b58-404f-995b-9dbcfd7718c5.png)\r\n\r\nOn this branch the `X` button in the top right was removed and the close button was replaced by an `X` button. Personally I think this looks good but it might be good to make the modal a bit wider so that the Instance ID does not have to wrap to the next line.\r\n\r\n**The navbar:**\r\n\r\nmain:\r\n![Screenshot from 2022-08-04 11-02-29](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47725857/182906962-33572196-6e40-4957-8169-fe13ca033022.png)\r\n\r\nthis branch:\r\n![Screenshot from 2022-08-04 10-27-54](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47725857/182906988-e0437e57-90bd-4bc0-993c-44458e1973e9.png)\r\n\r\nI see two main differences that both seem like they should be returned to how they previously were, if possible. The counter next to `debug` is no longer highlighted, and the 3 dots button has been changed to a help button.
