Metastore key for Container placement actions is UUID + Message type (req/res) and both request & response messages now belong to the same Namespace in metastore\r\n5. Documentation & other improvements \r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/572829955/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/573180139","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/samza/pull/1249#issuecomment-573180139","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/1249","id":573180139,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MzE4MDEzOQ==","user":{"login":"prateekm","id":1085859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODU4NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm","html_url":"https://github.com/prateekm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-10T19:48:32Z","updated_at":"2020-01-10T19:48:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@kw2542 Please document any public API changes in the description.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/573180139/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/573939144","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/samza/pull/1245#issuecomment-573939144","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/1245","id":573939144,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MzkzOTE0NA==","user":{"login":"prateekm","id":1085859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODU4NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm","html_url":"https://github.com/prateekm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-14T00:24:28Z","updated_at":"2020-01-14T00:24:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@atoomula FYI","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/573939144/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/573959700","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/samza/pull/1247#issuecomment-573959700","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/1247","id":573959700,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3Mzk1OTcwMA==","user":{"login":"bkonold","id":2802866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MDI4NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2802866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkonold","html_url":"https://github.com/bkonold","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkonold/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkonold/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkonold/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkonold/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkonold/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkonold/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkonold/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkonold/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkonold/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-14T01:47:42Z","updated_at":"2020-01-14T01:47:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Change LGTM.

Based on your description, it sounds like `getSystemStreamMetadata` gets called, so does that mean something needs to use the results from it? If you return an empty map, could that be misleading to the logic that uses `getSystemStreamMetadata`?\r\n\r\n**The exact stack trace of this method being called for the high-level sample job**\r\n`at org.apache.samza.system.azureblob.AzureBlobSystemAdmin.getSystemStreamMetadata(AzureBlobSystemAdmin.java:44)\r\nat org.apache.samza.execution.StreamManager.getStreamPartitionCounts(StreamManager.java:93)\r\nat org.apache.samza.execution.ExecutionPlanner.setInputAndOutputStreamPartitionCount(ExecutionPlanner.java:197)\r\n at org.apache.samza.execution.ExecutionPlanner.plan(ExecutionPlanner.java:86)\r\nat org.apache.samza.execution.JobPlanner.getExecutionPlan(JobPlanner.java:101)\r\nat org.apache.samza.execution.RemoteJobPlanner.prepareJobs(RemoteJobPlanner.java:57)\r\nat org.apache.samza.runtime.RemoteApplicationRunner.run(RemoteApplicationRunner.java:73)\r\nat org.apache.samza.runtime.ApplicationRunnerUtil.invoke(ApplicationRunnerUtil.java:49)\r\nat org.apache.samza.runtime.ApplicationRunnerMain.main(ApplicationRunnerMain.java:53)`\r\n\r\n**Usage of `getSystemStreamMetadata` in this stack trace:**\r\nIn the stack trace above, this method is used to get the number of partitions (=size of the map) of a stream in the job graph (all input and output streams). The partition counts are added to the job graph and then used to validate joins and calculate partitions for intermediate streams. Hence, returning an empty map for AzureBlobSystem will result in the partition count being 0 which is does not lead to any incorrect behavior.\r\n\r\n**Other usages (directly or transitively) of `getSystemStreamMetadata`:**\r\n\r\n1. Direct uses: CoordinatorStreamStore, CoordinatorStreamSystemConsumer, StreamManager.getPartitionCounts, StreamMetadataCache, KafkaSystemAdmin, KafkaCheckpointManager, TestRunner, SytemConsumerBench - of these only the StreamManager is relevant cause Azure Blob can not be as CoordinatorStream (as it has no consumer).\r\nStreamManager usage is described above.\r\n\r\n2. Transitive uses (via SystemAdmin.getSSPMetadata and SystemAdmin.getSystemStreamPartitionCounts) : NonTransactionalStateTaskStorageManager.getNewestChangelogSSPOffsets, TransactionalStateTaskStorageManager.getNewestChangelogSSPOffsets and SSPMetadataCache. None of these are relevant for Azure Blob.\r\n\r\n**Azure blob Storage as a system in samza:**\r\n1. There is no concept of a partition in Azure Blob Storage - it is mimicked through virtual folders (basically “/“) in the blob name. \r\n2. Samza's SystemStreamMetadata consists of StreamName and 3 offsets (oldest, newest and upcoming) which are not relevant for an Azure blob.\r\n\r\nFor all the above stated reasons, I believe it is acceptable to return an empty map for this method in AzureBlobSystemAdmin.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/579534309/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/579542328","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/samza/pull/1258#issuecomment-579542328","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/1258","id":579542328,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3OTU0MjMyOA==","user":{"login":"cameronlee314","id":37879374,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3ODc5Mzc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37879374?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronlee314","html_url":"https://github.com/cameronlee314","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronlee314/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronlee314/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronlee314/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronlee314/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronlee314/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronlee314/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronlee314/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronlee314/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronlee314/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-29T00:47:04Z","updated_at":"2020-01-29T00:47:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the detailed explanation.

So `HADOOP_CONF_DIR` is still on the classpath through `runtime-framework-resources-pathing.jar`; it is intentionally removed from the direct `-cp` argument, but the functionality should still be the same.

What do you think about having this configuration under `JobConfig` hierarchy instead of `StoreConfig`? I see why it is the way it is in your current PR and the reason for it to belong under `StoreConfig`. However, `stores.default....` dilutes the (implicit) stronger contract of what follows `stores` is the store name and makes `default` as a reserved store name.\r\n> 2. What are the challenges in coming up with code default for it? Can you add details in PR description about the limitations of code default and the need for configurability?\r\n\r\n@mynameborat \r\n\r\n1. This sounds reasonable. So you are suggesting we change this config to `job.default.changelog...`? I am good with that; I was only following what seemed to be an already established precedent in our configs w.r.t. \"default\" store configs: https://samza.apache.org/learn/documentation/latest/jobs/samza-configurations.html#advanced-storage-configurations. Take a look at replication factor.\r\n\r\n2. Will respond here and add to the PR. The need for a different value comes from an evaluation done internally (within LI) that we can have a more relaxed setting than 4hr across all our jobs. The code default was chosen when the feature was implemented and is now part of a released build of samza; this 4hr value has been communicated to OSS customers and since changing this value has an operational impact on customers' kafka deployments (storage space) and each customer may have different thresholds for what is acceptable in terms of cost, making this default configurable empowers them to easily configure their samza/kafka clusters.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/597286149/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/597355342","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/samza/pull/1310#issuecomment-597355342","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/1310","id":597355342,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NzM1NTM0Mg==","user":{"login":"Sanil15","id":16806974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODA2OTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16806974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sanil15","html_url":"https://github.com/Sanil15","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sanil15/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sanil15/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sanil15/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sanil15/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sanil15/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sanil15/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sanil15/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sanil15/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sanil15/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-10T22:40:23Z","updated_at":"2020-03-10T22:40:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Travis
