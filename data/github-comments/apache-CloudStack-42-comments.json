I guess returning `null` is done in many of the Investigators right now, but would be great to improve it. If we at least could make it the same in 4.4 like in master that'd be great because that works (https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/master/plugins/hypervisors/hyperv/src/com/cloud/ha/HypervInvestigator.java) and that throws `throw new UnknownVM();`\n\nThe `OVM3` Investigator also seems smarter (https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/master/plugins/hypervisors/ovm3/src/main/java/com/cloud/ha/Ovm3Investigator.java).\n\nI could live with a quick hotfix for `4.4` that I can deploy soon, and then improving this whole thing in `master`. Not sure what is possible right now. We'll discuss tomorrow :-)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/136099464/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/136106558","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/762#issuecomment-136106558","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/762","id":136106558,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNjEwNjU1OA==","user":{"login":"DaanHoogland","id":2486961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODY5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2486961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland","html_url":"https://github.com/DaanHoogland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-30T09:33:23Z","updated_at":"2015-08-30T09:33:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM, reviewing this I finally understand why we have a custom renderer at all.

Yes the first test in a way does the same thing only.

has been partially fixed on 4.6, but still the code can be improved since it might return null. Below an snippet of the 4.6 code:\n\n@Override\n   public boolean isVmAlive(com.cloud.vm.VirtualMachine vm, Host host) throws UnknownVM {\n       Status status = isAgentAlive(host);\n       if (status == null) {\n           throw new UnknownVM();\n       }\n       return status == Status.Up ? true : null;\n   }\n\nAs you can see, they now throw an Exception in canse the status is null. However, in the return it might return null. In addition, the return type is no longer a wrapper class, but a native boolean. Returning null would be very bad.\n\nCould you perhaps make an amalgama of the fix, @remibergsma ?
