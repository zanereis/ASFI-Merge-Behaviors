We only release memory when the Julia values are gc'd and your code is creating a large amount of copies and you are running out of memory because of that.\n\nAdditionally the code you are using creates a few temporaries arrays that then need to be garbage collected, amplifying the problem. `gpu_w` and `gpu_dw1` together use about 600MBs and one iteration of your code allocates atleast 800MB for temporaries.\n\nFrom my understanding of MXNet.jl we currently don't have to many inplace operators defined for NDArrays to do such computations and mainly rely on MXNet graph based execution to do those optimizations. So you might have more luck expressing this in terms of the symbolic API.\n\nSee the latter part of http://mxnetjl.readthedocs.org/en/latest/user-guide/overview.html for a discussion of inplace operations (low-level API) and the symbolic API.\n\n@pluskid Please correct me if I got anything wrong :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/212690028/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/212695033","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/1910#issuecomment-212695033","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1910","id":212695033,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMjY5NTAzMw==","user":{"login":"CXMA479","id":16094590,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDk0NTkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16094590?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CXMA479","html_url":"https://github.com/CXMA479","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CXMA479/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CXMA479/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CXMA479/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CXMA479/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CXMA479/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CXMA479/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CXMA479/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CXMA479/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CXMA479/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-21T02:06:44Z","updated_at":"2016-04-21T02:48:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@vchuravy \nok,it seems to be impossible to achieve using NDArrays.\nI have also being trying Symbolic API,but it is not easy for me,for example,there is no transpose operation ,but most important ,how can I use `backward()`  of `executor`?
