@moazreyad could you please advise us how to achieve the goal? (Adding GPU testing to Github workflows\r\n> #802), I will ask some RAs to help me for the implementation.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this goal, we will need these steps:\r\n\r\nFirst, we need to get github tokens from by opening a ticket at Apache INFRA. Apache has some information about github self hosted runners [here](https://infra.apache.org/self-hosted-runners.html). They don't recommend using it for some security reasons, so we have to explain that GPU build and test is important for SINGA. We also need to make sure the server which will run the github workflows is secure and that the known vulnerabilities of self-hosted runners will not occur in the NUS server. (for example, someone may login to the NUS server and gain access to SINGA github repository admin tokens.)\r\n\r\nTo complete this step, we may check [this ticket](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-19875) by Apache Arrow and open a similar one for SINGA.\r\n\r\nSecond, we create a docker image for the Runner and configure the workflows. If we use Linux, we need to install the [Runner](https://github.com/actions/runner) and its [pre-reqs](https://github.com/actions/runner/blob/main/docs/start/envlinux.md) in the Linux docker machine. The machine should also have the github tokens from the first step.

This kind of block is considered as the endpoint of the graph. I distinguish it from other types to better optimize the memory footprint of model
