Sorry for any inconvenience.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime you can run 'pre-commit run insert-license` (see https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#pre-commit-hooks-installed) - it's not yet 100% clear in the master docs but some more instructions are coming.\r\n\r\nThe .pre-commit-confg.yaml does have the section:\r\n\r\n```\r\n      - id: insert-license\r\n        name: Add licence for all rst files\r\n        exclude: ^\\.github/.*$\"|^airflow/_vendor/.*$\r\n        args:\r\n          - --comment-style\r\n          - \"||\"\r\n          - --license-filepath\r\n          - license-templates/LICENSE.rst\r\n        files: \\.rst$\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case it's probably spacing issue. Due to limitation of insert-license pre-commit we have to have a space in front of the .. in the .rst license. This has been changed recently in all the files while I committed the change so you probably took the license from previous (no-space-in-front) version. You can take a look at any of the .rst files now in master and copy&paste the license from there. This is what most people will do in the future I guess, so this will not be a problem. \r\n\r\nAnd BTW if you install pre-commit hooks yourself, you will not need to worry about the licences at all.  When you try to commit the file without the license, the license will be added for you, commit will fail and you will have a chance to add/commit the added licence immediately.\r\n\r\nSo you can just remove the licence now, install pre-commit, try to commit it and the licence will be added for you automagically.\r\n\r\nSorry for the inconvenience coming from the transition period.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/522802527/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/522803812","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5869#issuecomment-522803812","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5869","id":522803812,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMjgwMzgxMg==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-20T00:27:03Z","updated_at":"2019-08-20T00:27:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"CC @ryw","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/522803812/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/522804014","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5828#issuecomment-522804014","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5828","id":522804014,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMjgwNDAxNA==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-20T00:28:08Z","updated_at":"2019-08-20T00:28:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Bumping up .

But after I have done a little experiment, it turned out that eslinting for our .js files + upgrading to latest versions of deps (without known vulnerabilities) as first step can be introduced rather quickly. The change I've done in one evening already fixes all eslint problems AND upgrades to latest dependencies - this removes > 50 vulnerabilities from our code. Vast majority of those fixes is automatically generated by eslint. Even if we have js code to extract from html later - I think what I've done might be a major step in a very good direction.\r\n\r\nI think if a few people will take a look and test it on their installation / test harnesses they have we might very quickly get this merged into master. I have not been too involved in web UI part so I might have made some basic mistakes and it's worth to take a deeper look (even thought the UI in general seems to work fine after the upgrades/linting).\r\n\r\nI know for one there was a debate ES5 vs. ES6 in #3656 but it is likely not relevant any more (and especially in Airflow 2.0.0 context). So I went ahead and configured \"es6\" as target.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/522867132/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/522907951","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5566#issuecomment-522907951","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5566","id":522907951,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMjkwNzk1MQ==","user":{"login":"benjamingrenier","id":52801483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODAxNDgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52801483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjamingrenier","html_url":"https://github.com/benjamingrenier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjamingrenier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjamingrenier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjamingrenier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjamingrenier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjamingrenier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjamingrenier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjamingrenier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjamingrenier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjamingrenier/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-20T08:18:31Z","updated_at":"2019-08-20T08:18:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Can you do rebase, please?\r\n\r\nIt's done.
