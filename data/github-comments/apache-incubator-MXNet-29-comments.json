all\n\nI am trying the mlp.cpp code and I think it is good and able to be understood and able to compile. However, I met some problems and have no idea how to debug for it. The error is:\n\nCannot find Operator FullyConnected in registry.\n\nSo it should be related with the MXNET_REGISTER_OP_PROPERTY. I checked the code in fully_connected.cc, it should have already been registered.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7029845/11737719/09b7ce58-9faa-11e5-8b8e-6995da5bf734.png)\n\nAs you suggested in the doc on how to build a new operator, I tried to REGISTER the FullyConnected in the operator.h file which are included in my project. However it failed to compile, giving the error, unknown Type Error.\n\nI was not familiar with cpp. I have finished a runnable python version, and now I am trying a cpp version for several reasons. So if I could finish the cpp version, it could be a good example for those who are trying cpp.\n\nThe whole project should be runnable, I tested with the NDArray example and it is runnable with NDArray. So I believe my C_FLAGS and L_FLAGS are correct and the problem should be REGISTER related. Can you give any suggestions? Thanks a lot.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/163859681/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/163874883","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/831#issuecomment-163874883","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/831","id":163874883,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2Mzg3NDg4Mw==","user":{"login":"were","id":2356965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTY5NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2356965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/were","html_url":"https://github.com/were","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/were/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/were/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/were/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/were/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/were/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/were/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/were/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/were/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/were/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-11T08:36:13Z","updated_at":"2015-12-11T08:36:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"OK,

I do not think it is doing the same thing. For example, once multi_output is set to be true, the input data to the SoftmaxOutput is assumed to be a n x k x (x1,...,xn) dimensional input, instead a regular n x (x1,...,xn). Anyway, the case I am referring to is where you do not need to change the shape of input data matrix but that of the label matrix (from n x 1 to n x K).\n\nAnyway, there might be a possibility that the multi_output parameter way and my implementation is fundamentally doing the same thing, but I highly doubt about it. Therefore, at least for the problem I mentioned above, the multi_output way, is either not doing the same thing or implemented in a less elegant way where you have to duplicate the input data K times. \n\nI might be wrong because I did not went through it carefully, let me know your ideas. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/164108528/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/164109827","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/910#issuecomment-164109827","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/910","id":164109827,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NDEwOTgyNw==","user":{"login":"piiswrong","id":568948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODk0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong","html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-12T04:31:11Z","updated_at":"2015-12-12T04:31:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I see what you mean.

Then just train the model and everytime you call backward(), you need to update the numpy parameters by yourself. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/164162621/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/164163680","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/908#issuecomment-164163680","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/908","id":164163680,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NDE2MzY4MA==","user":{"login":"toothacher17","id":7029845,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMjk4NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7029845?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/toothacher17","html_url":"https://github.com/toothacher17","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toothacher17/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toothacher17/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toothacher17/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toothacher17/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toothacher17/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toothacher17/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toothacher17/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toothacher17/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toothacher17/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-12T15:59:17Z","updated_at":"2015-12-12T15:59:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@zhangchen-qinyinghua @piiswrong If I compiled the program with libmxnet.so in the mxnet/lib/ folder, then the program would get this error:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7029845/11762724/abf70642-a0be-11e5-8701-d74b5f124d05.png)\n\nIf I compiled it without libmxnet.so in the folder mxnet/lib/ (i moved it to another directory for python), then it would happen with the error I mentioned before.\n\nI believe this could be the problem.

Yes, you are right. The standard understanding of softmax is exactly to use this 1-of-K coding (name from PRML) where for each class, you have a {0,1} indicator. This can be easily generalized to multi-labels in the way as you mentioned. I derived the backprop accordingly. But from an implementation perspective, it maybe more desirable to use a label matrix of n x K instead of n x C (e.g. maybe C =1000, and K = 5). Of course when K is not fixed, your way is necessary. (I actually did implement it first in the way of 1-of-K coding, but were bothered by a big n x C matrix and turned to my current one.) Anyway, good point.\n\nI think @piiswrong 's suggestion is a nice way to get around and allow us to work with multi-label using the current mxnet layers. The only weak point is that we will need to do K times of Forward passing where only one is necessary. This may or may not be a big deal.

But each forward pass you still get C-way softmax, and you need to do it K times, which is more expansive then just doing it once. The only advantage is that the input label matrix is at lower memory cost (as you mentioned, you only need NxK label matrix, not NxC). I myself probably would not think that is a good strategy. Also, from optimization standpoint, Softmax will push up the value of the target, and push down others. Yes you do it K times to ensure that each target value gets to be pushed up. But still there is some gradients that try to push down the target values, even though it really shouldn't be. Don't know if this is clear: \n\nSay K = 2, C = 10  Take one data point (x, y) where y = (1,4)\nYou will get gradients that try to raise the value of 1 and 4.

I also had this concern when I saw piiwrong's suggestion (of using K different softmax layers). But once you go into the math derivation, you will see it is actually equivalent. This is because the backprop gradient will be a summation of all the backprop from each labeled class and there is no explicit push down as you might imagined. Please check out the current way they implement softmax and you will probably see what I am saying here.\n\nAnyway, I am pretty sure that my current implementation work correctly and in an memory efficient manner (one forward one backward and using only N x K memory).
