However, my thinking is that if the same id was added then the user have encountered a duplicate id exception anyway and the app wouldn't have worked.  In this case, we check for the duplicate ids, replace it if found, and, if not, add it anyway. So I don't think it should break any existing users and only help those affected by this dup id issue. \r\n\r\nEdit: CHECK_ID_PRODUCTION_MODE is auto for production , so I think think error should have still occurred. Testing shows the exception is thrown in production w/ auto.\r\n\r\nCHECK_ID_PRODUCTION_MODE options: \r\n- true : Check all client ids, including UILeaf components\r\n\r\n- auto : check ids of components that does not encapsulate markup (like facelets UILeaf).\r\nNote ids of UILeaf instances are generated by facelets vdl, start with \"j_id\", are never rendered\r\ninto the response and UILeaf instances are never used as a target for listeners, so in practice\r\nthere is no need to check such ids. This reduce the overhead associated with generate client ids\r\n\r\n- false : Do not check for duplicate ids in production.\r\n\r\nMight be useful to check for `j_id__rd` since this seems to occur with Resource Dependencies.
