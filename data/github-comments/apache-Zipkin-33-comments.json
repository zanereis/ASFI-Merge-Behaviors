This approach could nicely support bringing in features from forks: keep the default experience consistent and always correct, but let users choose their trade-offs. Of course that adds overhead in maintenance, or rather instability; we'll never ever test all 600 combinations of feature flags. Initially I'd solve that by adding cautionary comments and documentation.

here's an idea. Right now, the only code that's needed and not in zipkin-java is zipkin-ui. \n\n## Preparation: move zipkin-ui to zipkin-java and stop development here\n\nRegardless, first step we should take is move zipkin-ui to zipkin-java and stop affecting master here:\n1. Merge pull requests and cut a final release of zipkin-ui here\n2. Migrate zipkin-ui to zipkin-java repo (via `git filter-branch` and friends to preserve history)\n   - implies converting the build script to the maven alternative\n3. cut zipkin-ui from the zipkin-java repo\n\nAt this point, everything is in sync and we have a couple options to proceed.\n\n## Option 1: shuffle repository names\n\nThe simplest option would be to rename zipkin to something else (zipkin-archived or zipkin-legacy) and then rename zipkin-java to zipkin.\n\n### Pros\n- no chance to screw up forks (they basically can continue off master and/or be abandoned)\n- irrelevant issues and old pull requests aren't imported to the new codebase\n- current issues in zipkin-java are retained\n\n### Cons\n- Not sure if the rename shuffle will work or not. Ex can you rename a github repository to a historical name of another?\n- Some issues like UI ones, or the new model will need to be recreated\n- zipkin-java has less stars and watchers.\n  - These would need to be organically regrown\n- zipkin-java has less collaborators.\n  - Folks who've done historical work in zipkin won't show up in the commit log until they do more work.\n\n## Option 2: git-fu\n\nAnother approach would be to rename master to scala, push master from the java codebase, then turn off zipkin-java\n\n### Pros\n- zipkin stars, watchers, and collaborator stats remain in place\n- issues that don't relate to the scala implementation don't need to be recreated.\n\n### Cons\n- folks with existing forks off master on either side will be disrupted\n  - The act of turning off zipkin-java abandons relevant forks off the current codebase\n  - The act of renaming master here disrupts any forks off the old codebase\n- closed pull requests and issues have little to do with the current codebase or build.\n  - Basically search is irrelevant, as most issues will refer to things that never affected the java port, ex finagle, scrooge, anorm, sbt, gradle...\n\n---\n\n#### Adrian's vote: Option 1: shuffle\n\nThe more I think about it, the less I like option 2. I feel it disrupts both sides with technical gotchas. While I do like the idea of memorializing past contributions and stars, I hope we've made a project that people will star again, and contribute to again. I'll certainly continue to contribute effort to the socializing of zipkin such that stars might be reborn faster. I'd also offer effort to recreate issues that are still relevant.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/222404126/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/222405177","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1119#issuecomment-222405177","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1119","id":222405177,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMjQwNTE3Nw==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-30T03:31:18Z","updated_at":"2016-05-30T03:32:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"cc'ing people who've contributed code in the last month to either repo:\n- zipkin(-scala): @NegatioN @esbie @yurishkuro \n- zipkin-java: @sveinnfannar @dsyer @abesto @eirslett @michaelsembwever \n\n(note zipkin-ui history will be preserved as a part of the migration regardless)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/222405177/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/222407912","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1119#issuecomment-222407912","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1119","id":222407912,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMjQwNzkxMg==","user":{"login":"yurishkuro","id":3523016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MjMwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3523016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro","html_url":"https://github.com/yurishkuro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-30T04:08:20Z","updated_at":"2016-05-30T04:08:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"what about moving scala code to a branch in `zipkin` repo?

config.json\n\nWhen config.json is missing, it's a completely blank screen, with text to the effect of\n\n```\nError loading config.json: server error (Bad Gateway)\n```\n\nThe rationale for this is that [the mechanism for showing the entire UI](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/blob/master/zipkin-ui/js/main.js#L9) relies on config.json, so if it's not there then loading the UI doesn't make sense. Typically you only run into this with a misconfiguration anyways -- but right now, you get a blank page, which is confusing. This is better than a blank page.\n\nThis can be triggered by running `npm run dev` without launching a zipkin query server.\n\n### ajax errors\n\nScreenshot for bad gateway (this can be triggered by runnning `npm run dev` without launching a zipkin server, just make sure to add a `{}` to `static/config.json` so you don't trigger the config.json error instead).\n\n![span_loads](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/567900/15662246/cf6cc5e2-26bc-11e6-8867-7031e1edc63a.png)\n\n### query errors\n\nScreenshot for bad query such as `foo==bar`... the error message could be better if the query server returned a better message.

I feel your pain, as I've mentioned this myself a couple times. However, the route isn't to ask the entire zipkin ecosystem to change to adopt this format. The following issue is tracking this https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-sleuth/issues/253\n\nThere are good reasons for spring-cloud-stream to envelope data, because it is trying to do things portable across different messaging transports. This isn't a good enough reason to muddy zipkin's data format.\n\nFor example, this data has nothing to do with the payload, intentionally! There's also no cross-language tool that shares this format. In other words, we'd be special-casing spring-cloud-stream, but impacting several languages who don't have a tool that reads this, and probably couldn't be runtime portable with spring-cloud-stream. In other words, this is the wrong way to look at the problem.\n\nI'd explore some way of making sleuth/stream send zipkin formatted messages to a dedicated zipkin topic. For example, sending in a way that doesn't require affecting the payload. If that isn't possible, another option would be to add a KafkaZipkinSpanReporter, referencing the one in brave.\n\nhttps://github.com/openzipkin/brave/blob/master/brave-spancollector-kafka/src/main/java/com/github/kristofa/brave/kafka/KafkaSpanCollector.java\n\nKafka reporters in any language are <100 lines of code, and it is normal case in zipkin to expect transports such as http, scribe and kafka to not share the actual transport code or metadata. What does work is sharing a data format, so we should focus on how to achieve that.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/223167843/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/223471386","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1119#issuecomment-223471386","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1119","id":223471386,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMzQ3MTM4Ng==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-03T01:50:33Z","updated_at":"2016-06-03T01:50:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"here's some related work in docker land, basically renaming the java image to \"zipkin\" as it doesn't need qualification since it includes collector and query functionality https://github.com/openzipkin/docker-zipkin-java/pull/9\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/223471386/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/223515439","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1127#issuecomment-223515439","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1127","id":223515439,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMzUxNTQzOQ==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-03T07:59:07Z","updated_at":"2016-06-03T07:59:07Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The issue you are getting is because you are running an older version\nof cassandra.
