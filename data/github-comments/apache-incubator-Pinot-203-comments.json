During your investigation do you see closing all connections necessary? Ideally we want to only close the connection that throws exception for the following reasons:\r\n> \r\n> * Closing all connections will fail all on-the-fly queries\r\n> * Some connections might not request lots of memory (data not evenly distributed, expensive query only hits subset of servers)\r\n> * After releasing the connection throwing the exception, other connections might recover\r\n\r\nYeah I phrased dealock as every channel actually got a (pretty even) portion of the memory allocation and waiting. \r\n\r\n> Ideally we want to only close the connection that throws exception\r\n\r\nYes that is also what I initially thought would work. But in the worst case we tested (150+ servers each sending some hundred MB response), some connections to these 150 servers would start to throw OOM exceptions first; once we close them, the others recovered very slow/ would still be blocked in 10 minutes. In other words, once the OOM starts to happen, reseting connection only to channels throwing OOM not give us a prompt recover. \r\n\r\n> Closing all connections will fail all on-the-fly queries\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what is the usecase on your side? One thing we might be able to do to limit the blast range is: for the OOM channels we fetch the current in fly query ids and just resetting the channels having those ids. However, this would introduces quite some complication to the error handling code; not sure if that's what we want to do here or we might invest some time in a finer grained solution as folks have suggested in the discussions above?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1724444153/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1724480272","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/11611#issuecomment-1724480272","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/11611","id":1724480272,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5myXsQ","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-18T21:28:11Z","updated_at":"2023-09-18T21:50:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"##

We have added so many hardcoded plan tests, and whenever we need to add a feature that changes the query plan it is extremely painful because we need to modify thousands of lines of test. #11418 is an example where the actual change might be 20 lines but almost 2000 lines of test change. We need to either modify the test to only test the part related, or provide a way to regenerate the expected results automatically\r\n\r\nI usually let the test run and look at the difference in the plans and verify whether the planner side makes sense.

I don't know of a good way to generate these automatically though (unlike runtime where for most queries H2 can be used).

Would it be helpful to reduce duplication in the plans by removing some of the unnecessary ones (e.g. in window functions initially we had tests for single window functions and corresponding tests using multiple window functions - this was good for the initial development to ensure both work but may not be so useful now)?\r\n\r\none way is to utilize something similar to https://github.com/apache/calcite/blob/9c758942ab51af22a1095087ea2daeabc7d692ea/core/src/test/resources/org/apache/calcite/test/RelOptRulesTest.xml where \r\n1. the RulesTest.xml is generated and compared against the reference during build/test time; and \r\n2. once we validate all the deltas look good, we can directly copy-paste over the changes from the generated xml to the ref xml\r\n3. create the PR then merged/checked-in the ref --> so there's no hand modification required\r\n\r\nthoughts?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1725972870/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1726059351","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/11591#issuecomment-1726059351","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/11591","id":1726059351,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5m4ZNX","user":{"login":"GSharayu","id":21273286,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjczMjg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21273286?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GSharayu","html_url":"https://github.com/GSharayu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GSharayu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GSharayu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GSharayu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GSharayu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GSharayu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GSharayu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GSharayu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GSharayu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GSharayu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-19T16:40:13Z","updated_at":"2023-09-19T16:40:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> > Hi @xiangfu0 @Jackie-Jiang ,\r\n> > As @mcvsubbu mentioned, We are working with partner team to resolve the table creation flow since this will error out for new tables.

of the problems here is that the two window functions belong to different window groups. The default for ROW_NUMBER is ROWS type frame and for COUNT it’s RANGE type. I need to check if calcite splits the window groups for these if ORDER BY isn’t present, but my recent PR adds ROWS support for window functions with ORDER BY allowing such a query to run if for COUNT the explicit ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING is passed. We decided not to support multiple window groups in the same query due to the complications around how exchanges should be done and which part should handle which window function \r\n\r\nI’ll get back to you later on my testing without ORDER BY, but just a caveat here that calcite doesn’t let you use ROWS without ORDER BY (it will compile but calcite will override frame type as RANGE)\r\n\r\nalso just to make sure I understand, what’s the intended frames behavior here with the two window functions?\r\n\r\nsupporting multiple window groups in a generic way will require some design and implementation to get the exchanges right.
