mistercrunch was saying, when you try to run queries pressing the button to run them as \"async\", you should first install Celery and any broker, for instance Redis (I tested with Redis and it worked).\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n1. in your virtualenv, install \"celeris\"\r\n```\r\n#Install Celery in python\r\npip install celery\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. install redis. In my case, I installed it in the same machine, but it could be installed separately. In my case, I am using red-hat 7 as OS:\r\n```\r\n# Install the EPEL repository\r\nrpm -Uvh dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/7/x86_64/e/epel-release-*.rpm\r\n\r\n#Install redis\r\nyum install redis\r\n```\r\n3. Start Redis (note: it depends on your OS, in my case, it is Red-Hat):\r\n#Start the Redis Service\r\nsystemctl start redis.service\r\n\r\n4. Back to Python, and install the additional dependency to be able to use Redis in Celeris\r\n`pip install -U \"celery[redis]\"`\r\n\r\n5. Now, you should make some changes in the Celeris configuration. So you should edit the superset_config.py file in the following directory:\r\n`<path_to_your_virtualenv>/lib/python2.7/site-packages/superset/static/assets/superset_config.py`\r\nNote: In my case, I've created the virtualenv \"venv\" in my home directory:\r\n`/home/my_user/venv/lib/python2.7/site-packages/superset/static/assets/superset_config.py`\r\nNote: after updating the config file, you should compile the superset_config.py file to get a *.pyc file running the following commands in python:\r\n```\r\n>>> import py_compile\r\n>>> py_compile.compile('<path_to_your_virtualenv>/lib/python2.7/site-packages/superset/static/assets/superset_config.py')\r\n```\r\n\r\n6. Make the following changes (bear in mind that in my case, I've installed redis in the same machine, in the port by default 6379. If you have done in a diffferent hostname/port, replace \"localhost:6379\" by your values):\r\n```\r\n# Configure the class \"CeleryConfig\", by adding the URL of your Redis installation (in my case, localhost:6379):\r\nclass CeleryConfig(object):\r\n  BROKER_URL =  'redis://localhost:6379/'\r\n  CELERY_IMPORTS = ('superset.sql_lab', )\r\n  CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND =  'redis://localhost:6379/'\r\n  CELERY_ANNOTATIONS = {'tasks.add': {'rate_limit': '10/s'}}\r\nCELERY_CONFIG = CeleryConfig\r\nHTTP_HEADERS = {\r\n    'super': 'header!'\r\n}\r\n\r\n# comment the current RESULTS_BACKEND value\r\n#RESULTS_BACKEND = None\r\n\r\n# assign a new value to RESULTS_BACKEND\r\nRESULTS_BACKEND = FileSystemCache('/tmp/sqllab_cache', default_timeout=60*24*7)\r\n```\r\nSave the changes and restart.\r\n\r\n7. It is ready. You should run the celeris worker. It can be done running the following command inside your virtualenv:\r\n`superset worker`\r\n\r\n8. Start the Superset server running in your virtualenv the command is below:\r\n`superset runserver`\r\n\r\nNow, when you run any async query (pressing the button), Superset will make use of Celery, and the results of your query will be retrieved using Celery and Redis.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I have some spare time, I will update the Superset installation document with this info.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/296678352/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":3,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/296713965","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/2657#issuecomment-296713965","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/2657","id":296713965,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NjcxMzk2NQ==","user":{"login":"roganw","id":7597155,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1OTcxNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7597155?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roganw","html_url":"https://github.com/roganw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roganw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roganw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roganw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roganw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roganw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roganw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roganw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roganw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roganw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-24T15:47:08Z","updated_at":"2017-04-24T15:47:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"\".widget.pivot_table\"
