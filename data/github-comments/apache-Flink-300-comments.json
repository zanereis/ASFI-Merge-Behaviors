I think `flatMap` cloud solve the problem you described in the issue.\r\n\r\n@klion26 thanks for your review. I think this pr will help the user to sum the value for convenience.\r\n\r\nwith `flatMap`, people have to convert the tuple (such as Tuple2<Long, Integer[]>  while the length of the  Integer[] is 3 ) to a flat tuple ( Tuple4<Long, Integer, Integer,Integer>) then sum with fields (1,2,3). \r\n\r\nIn my opinion,  It's too heavy for user. And When the length of the  Integer[] changed, we have to change the Tuple4 to TupleX in java code ?\r\n\r\nIf I make some mistake with your review. please let me know. Thanks very much.\r\n

Also from the feedback, I got that **it is ok if** the default stays the same for now.\r\nAdditional motivation to split those things explicitly are:\r\n * providing separate simple `hostname`, `ip` mechanisms early, may allow the Flink community to try them out and give feedback if simple bindings don't work for some people and the heuristic based one is needed in such cases (this would require some pro-activity on users' side, but in that case they may also share what is their setup).\r\n * `ip` option is a new one. So far, nobody has asked explicitly for it and especially for a version with heuristic address detection. There is a hope that it would mitigate [[FLINK-11127]](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-11127) until a proper fix. But for Kubernetes case, the heuristic address detection has weak value and guarantees (when JM and TMs started in parallel without external coordination). In the worst case (for FLINK-11127), this option is not helpful at all and users have to fallback to old workarounds. On a good side, if it helps, then it's one more argument that heuristic auto detection is not needed (in Kubernetes setups).\r\n\r\n> There was also another question about using `InetAddress.getByName(address)` instead of `getHostAdress`.\r\n\r\nMaybe there is some misunderstanding.\r\nThe `address` in your snippet is not some random input, but `InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostName()`.\r\nI don't see much value in (effectively, what you propose)\r\n```\r\nInetAddress address = InetAddress.getLocalHost();\r\naddress = InetAddress.getByName(address.getHostName());\r\nreturn address.getHostAddress();\r\n```\r\ncompared to \r\n```\r\nInetAddress address = InetAddress.getLocalHost();\r\nreturn address.getHostAddress();\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/466343355/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/466344942","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/7799#issuecomment-466344942","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/7799","id":466344942,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NjM0NDk0Mg==","user":{"login":"Tom-Goong","id":3354765,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNTQ3NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3354765?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Goong","html_url":"https://github.com/Tom-Goong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Goong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Goong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Goong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Goong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Goong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Goong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Goong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Goong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Goong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-22T10:09:03Z","updated_at":"2019-02-22T10:09:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@klion26  Ok, thanks for your comment.\r\nI just started making some simple contributions to the open source project, and the process is still unfamiliar to me.
