Most places the worker code calls Runtime.halt on error, which does not call any of the shutdown hooks.  It just exits.  I think that was done because shutdown hooks can lock up, and if they do the process does not exit.  So we could get zombie processes.  Typically I have seen this addressed by installing a shutdown hook that will let the other shutdown hooks run for a maximum amount of time, at which point it calls Runtime.halt.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612445707/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/46047187","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/142#issuecomment-46047187","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/142","id":46047187,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MDQ3MTg3","user":{"login":"ptgoetz","id":260896,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDg5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/260896?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz","html_url":"https://github.com/ptgoetz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-06-13T18:51:36Z","updated_at":"2014-06-13T18:51:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"+1\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/46047187/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612470766","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4194#issuecomment-2612470766","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4194","id":2612470766,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI0NzA3NjY=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-06-13T18:51:37Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T12:56:20Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a

In unix a process can install a handler for SIGTERM and actually ignore it entirely.  But SIGKILL cannot be ignored.  The OS will not give the user process any chance to handle it.  Java handles SIGTERM and calls System.exit when it happens.  But if the shutdown handlers lock up for some reason we have effectively ignored the SIGTERM.  In my case something happened so the executor would not exit, not sure why, but this caused the shutdown to never finish.
