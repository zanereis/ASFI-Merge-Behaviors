I have updated the pull request as suggested. The following changes are made\r\n\r\n1. Remove the checkpoint type for incremental checkpoints. Now the support for incremental checkpointing becomes a configurable feature in `RocksDBKeyedStateBackend`, just like asynchronous checkpointing in `HeapKeyedStateBackend`. Incremental checkpointing will be performed if the feature is enabled and the checkpoint to perform is not a savepoint.\r\n\r\n2. Rename `RocksDBKeyedStateHandle` to `RocksDBIncrementalKeyedStateHandle` and do some refactoring.\r\n\r\n3. Allow `KeyedStateHandle` to register shared states.\r\n\r\n4. Maintain the information of last completed checkpoint with the notification of `AbstractStreamOperator`.\r\n\r\n5. Parameterize `RocksDBStateBackendTest` to test the cleanup of resources in both full and incremental checkpointing.\r\n\r\n6. Parameterize `PartitionedStateCheckpointingITCase` to test the snapshotting and restoring with different backend settings.\r\n\r\nIt's appreciated if you can take a look at these changes.

I tracked the problem and I think the cause is a lack of eagerly closing the streams in `cancel()` to interrupt blocking IO calls.\r\n\r\nI suggest the following fix:\r\n\r\n`RocksDBIncrementalSnapshotOperation` should have it’s own `CloseableRegistry`. This tracks all the open streams inside the checkpointing and is registered with the backends registry for as long as the task runs. Then, in cancel, as a first step we can close and unregister that inner `CloseableRegistry`. This also prevents races that the current stream gets closed asynchronously by `cancel()`, which the checkpointing actually already opened the next stream (the registry closes and blocks new streams on registration once it is closed)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/299422248/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/299425398","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3828#issuecomment-299425398","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3828","id":299425398,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5OTQyNTM5OA==","user":{"login":"alpinegizmo","id":43608,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNjA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43608?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpinegizmo","html_url":"https://github.com/alpinegizmo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpinegizmo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpinegizmo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpinegizmo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpinegizmo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpinegizmo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpinegizmo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpinegizmo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpinegizmo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpinegizmo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-05T09:50:59Z","updated_at":"2017-05-05T09:50:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@greghogan Thanks for the feedback!

A recent change was that the blob cache will try and fetch blobs directly from the blob store, which may cause pre-mature reads before the blob has been fully written. Because the storage systems we target for HA do not all support atomic renames (S3 does not), we need to use the `_SUCCESS` file trick to mark completed blobs.\r\n\r\nI chatted with @tillrohrmann about that, he agreed to take a look at fixing these and will make an effort to get this into the 1.3 release.

For example for HDFS and posix-style file systems, we want to dispose the checkpoint-exclusive state via a `rm -r`.\r\nHowever, for S3 we explicitly do not want to do that, but issue DELETE commands for each state object independently, because Flink has a more consistent view on what objects exist for a checkpoint than S3 has. Also, because a `rm -r` on the S3 file system means \"list objects with path prefix; foreach object: delete\" which is even worse.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/299700740/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/299701572","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3522#issuecomment-299701572","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3522","id":299701572,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5OTcwMTU3Mg==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-07T11:59:52Z","updated_at":"2017-05-07T11:59:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Here is a summary of why I picked a String initially for the metadata persistence location:\r\n\r\n> The idea of the pointer is to have a state-backend independent string that indicates a checkpoint location.

I also had a look into a couple of important tests, but could not go through all the implementation details for now.\r\n\r\nOverall, I think this is very good work and improves a ton of things w.r.t. everything that has to do with serialization format updates and backwards compatibility.
