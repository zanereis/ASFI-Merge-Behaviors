If we specifies default value from UI layer, we will not be able to specify blank setting.\r\n\r\nInstead, I made the tooltip hint more clearly explain how those configuration affect to control batch. It works differently for input-port (client side throttle) and output-port (remote side throttle, client only ask its preference).\r\n\r\nFor input port:\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1107620/25264659/4503f9c4-26a3-11e7-8bd1-e9d5903ec1cb.png)\r\n\r\nFor output port:\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1107620/25264710/a578bcc2-26a3-11e7-8e48-14a9c16f65b8.png)\r\n\r\nFinally, for the partial update against DTO, I couldn't come up with better alternatives so I just updated API documentation.

Continuing to follow up on the partial update... is there a reason that batchCount, batchSize, and batchDuration must be updated as a single unit? Should a user not but able to just set just one of them? It seems the logic in `StandardRemoteGroupPort` considers each field individually and each, if set, could allow for the termination of a transaction.\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (maxBatchCount > 0 && flowFilesSent.size() >= maxBatchCount) {\r\n  flowFile = null; // if maxBatchCount is set and current transaction exceeds, stop\r\n} else if (maxBatchBytes > 0 && bytesSent >= maxBatchBytes) {\r\n  flowFile = null; // if maxBatchBytes is set and current transaction exceeds, stop\r\n} else if (sendingNanos >= maxBatchDuration) {\r\n  flowFile = null; // if maxBatchDuration is set (default of 500 millis if not) and current transaction exceeds, stop\r\n} else {\r\n  flowFile = session.get(); // continue the transaction\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't see a reason to prevent setting just the batchSize for instance.

Just saw it. I think the logic here is still not quite right, though. And I think I may have actually misunderstood what was happening initially, as well. If unable to delete the 'hold' that the other side places on the FlowFile, PostHTTP enters a loop of continually attempting to delete the hold, until it gets a response back. If an IOException occurs, with the logic you added in, it will route to failure and then the next iteration of the loop will try to transfer the FlowFile again. I think the best approach would be to limit the loop to happen some number of times (e.g., 3 or 5 or 10 times) and if unable to communicate with the remote instance for that number of times, at that point we should route to failure and return. We used a loop here, I think, because we don't want to send say 1 GB of data and then have a garbage collection or a network hiccup or whatever prevent the delete and have to re-transmit all that data. So a few retries is likely a good idea. We should probably also not be logging the errors/stack traces until we finish retrying though.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/296660614/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/296698081","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1686#issuecomment-296698081","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1686","id":296698081,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NjY5ODA4MQ==","user":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-24T15:06:54Z","updated_at":"2017-04-24T15:06:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@alopresto one thought regarding the StaticKeyProvider... rather than having a .key=<hex> perhaps it would make sense to instead use a .key.<key_id>=<hex> property scheme.

The current approach has some important limitations like the processors which can be supported have to explicitly referenced in code for now.

Sorry, I was missing what's unique about this case which is that it is an **optional** number. I don't believe we have this case elsewhere. Other places where we have numbers, they have default values and support being updated but not unconfigured.\r\n\r\nI have one thought that may make the DTO/API a little more clear. As is, the behavior of setting the fields differ within the same DTO and even amongst the same fields depending on the presence of other fields. Since we want the batch settings to be treated as a single unit in terms of configuration, what are your thoughts introducing a `BatchSettingsDTO` for relaying this configuration? For clarity, I'm suggesting the possibility of the `RemoteProcessGroupPortDTO` having a `BatchSettingsDTO` which has `batchCount`, `batchSize`, and `batchDuration`.\r\n\r\nWith this approach, in the `RemoteProcessGroupPortDTO` the behavior is consistent. If a field is set, attempt to configure it. If a field is null, leave the existing configuration in place. Within the `BatchSettingsDTO` we can stipulate that these fields are a single unit and the proposed configuration will replace the existing configuration. I think this approach would be functionally equivalent but may be slightly less confusing.\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\nNot trying to be super picky here but need to be very conscious of the changes as they are part of the public REST API. Just trying to make this as clear as possible. If someone directly invokes these endpoints I'd hate if they inadvertently cleared the existing desired configuration.
