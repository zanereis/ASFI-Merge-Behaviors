All the threads, including the parent will be doing some process and adding the status of the process they are handling , say success or failure in the span tags. At the end who ever finishes the last, there, I want to see the success of entire process. I hope the way to communicate with threads is contextmanager.snapshot. I want the segment to be hold till the entire threads are done which i guess can be achieved through prepareforasync and asynFinish.
