Can you please summarize where we are?\r\n\r\nHi @vinothchandar \r\n\r\nAs we know, hudi's partition supports `yyyy/mm/dd` form. If the partition data is `yyyy-mm-dd` form in fact data, user needs to  implements `PartitionValueExtractor`.\r\n\r\nFrom the definition of `HIVE_ASSUME_DATE_PARTITION_OPT_KEY`, it means that user needs to set it `true` if they customed the `PartitionValueExtractor`\r\n\r\nBut, this variable is used incorrectly, it is a logic error. The right usage is `!assumeDatePartitioning`.\r\n\r\nSo, modify `assumeDatePartitioning` to `! assumeDatePartitioning ` is the best way to fix this issue.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n**The definition of `HIVE_ASSUME_DATE_PARTITION_OPT_KEY`**\r\nProperty: `hoodie.datasource.hive_sync.assume_date_partitioning`, Default: `false` \r\n<span style=\"color:grey\">Assume partitioning is `yyyy/mm/dd`</span>\r\n\r\n**FSUtils#getAllPartitionPaths**\r\n```\r\npublic static List<String> getAllPartitionPaths(FileSystem fs, String basePathStr, boolean assumeDatePartitioning)\r\n    throws IOException {\r\n  if (assumeDatePartitioning) {\r\n    return getAllPartitionFoldersThreeLevelsDown(fs, basePathStr);\r\n  } else {\r\n    return getAllFoldersWithPartitionMetaFile(fs, basePathStr);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/569978944/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/569979828","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/828#issuecomment-569979828","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/828","id":569979828,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2OTk3OTgyOA==","user":{"login":"lamberken","id":20113411,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTEzNDEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20113411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken","html_url":"https://github.com/lamberken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-31T19:35:01Z","updated_at":"2019-12-31T19:35:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> In that case, I am not sure why the code would not find the partitions it just wrote? is this S3? may be an eventual consistency issue?\r\n\r\nWe can discuss about it here, https://github.com/apache/incubator-hudi/pull/1105#issuecomment-569978944","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/569979828/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
