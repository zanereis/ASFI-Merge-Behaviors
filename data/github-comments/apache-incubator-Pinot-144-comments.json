Most minion related errors and confusion is seen by users when getting started. Given the popularity of trying to use the minion tasks for ingestion and rollups, we're seeing an influx of questions in the community slack, about minion related debugging. Most of the time, the users are asking if there's an API to quickly see the scheduling side and task execution side errors. Plus during the getting started phase, metrics reporting backend, alerting or log processors isn't usually setup. \r\nThis will be very helpful for such users to quickly debug their issues during the getting started process. This will be used in the Minion UI tab that's come up in the Pinot UI now: https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/8978","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1182587553/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1182605892","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/9049#issuecomment-1182605892","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/9049","id":1182605892,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5GfSJE","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-12T23:52:34Z","updated_at":"2022-07-13T22:55:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/9049?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) Report\n> Merging [#9049](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/9049?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (b559fcb) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/commit/0c55422d8bb5ff0df3e7871c9b1a1e52be38aecc?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (0c55422) will **increase** coverage by `6.62%`.\n> The diff coverage is `61.22%`.\n\n> :exclamation: Current head b559fcb differs from pull request most recent head 646fe25.

I think the right solution might be to support this at two levels\r\n- Decoder (convert raw payload to GenericRow) \r\n   * Decoder should internally handle exception, retry etc but probably not skip a record and return null instead or generic row with skip=true or something like that and adhere to the contract.. return the new offset.\r\n- Pinot  (convert generic row to pinot data types)\r\n * this should be common behavior across all decoders, if the conversion fails and if the ignoreBadRows is set to true, we should be able to continue with the next record else log the exception and stop the consumption\r\n\r\nI also dont want to block @ddcprg.

In case of our customers, they don't want to run a one-off pagination query OFFSET M, FETCH N where M and N are completely random in which case it is not possible to reason about the results and it's even hard for the user to decide M as a one-off starting point. Result of a random pagination query doesn’t add any value to the user since they want to look at the entire result as a continuous stream of results / pages / batches with the will to stop anytime. \r\n\r\nSo, the semantics that we want to provide is that \"I want to fetch 10 million records from Pinot for a query and want to fetch 100K at a time\". The customer will typically start with M as 0 and might just keep N fixed (say at 10K or 100K etc) and just keep paging the results through multiple calls from their app which simply changes M during every call (and they potentially refresh the results in UI etc returned by Pinot in every call). \r\n\r\nI think we should look at the pagination problem from this perspective as opposed to a random one-off pagination query. We are trying to tackle the problem from this angle. Detail design discussion is in progress.\r\n\r\nSome more thoughts slightly related to this -- \r\n\r\nNow, one problem is that users who run such queries may have the tendency to think that support for pagination means they can run \"any\" query in Pinot that can be very long running and Pinot is guaranteed to finish it and provide results. This can easily cause OOM (out of memory) and bring down the cluster. \r\n\r\nPinot is unlikely to enter the territory of running very long running queries and getting the entire 100% accurate result by spilling to disk and avoiding OOM at all times. Presto should be used for those cases. \r\n\r\nHowever, for some of our users (who are ok with multi-second latency and prefer slightly more accurate response for GROUP BY queries),  as a follow-up / next phase, we want to consider enhancing support in Pinot for queries that return large responses and/or process / aggregate more than usual amounts of data. We want to do this by doing some of the memory intensive query execution operations in off-heap (direct) memory. This along with the ability to paginate a large response back sort of fulfills the requirements we are seeing in production.

decided to remove the cpu requests and specify instead `-XX=ActiveProcessorCount=2` in the default jvmOpts.\r\n\r\nI think this approach is better because the request approach consumed at least 8 CPUs. This means that, by default, the chart would not start in clusters with less than 8 CPUs in total, which can be very common in local k8s installations (like minikube or microk8s) and also in small aws machines.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, with this change:\r\n- Nodes with a lot of cpus will not be affected. Anyway, in this case it is expected that a custom `-XX=ActiveProcessorCount` will be used to determine how many threads each container will use.\r\n- Nodes with few cpus will have installations that use quite more threads than cpus. This could introduce performance issues due to high context switching when several queries are being executed at the same time, but the system should run well enough to do some tests, which is the common use case of this kind of installations.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1185340366/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1185342402","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/9058#issuecomment-1185342402","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/9058","id":1185342402,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5GpuPC","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-15T09:09:06Z","updated_at":"2022-07-22T07:59:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/9058?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) Report\n> Merging [#9058](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/9058?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (35d8326) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/commit/f0a4b443699bd550b1608e4dea7cd68bc9bc6a61?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (f0a4b44) will **decrease** coverage by `1.31%`.\n> The diff coverage is `26.38%`.\n\n> :exclamation: Current head 35d8326 differs from pull request most recent head 9fa0078.
