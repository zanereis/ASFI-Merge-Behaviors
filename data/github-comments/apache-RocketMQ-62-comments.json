那就看看是不是磁盘的问题，应该刷盘慢的时间段await, io util也很高，但看起来业务量不大。配置看起来设置比较简单，MQ这边可以调优一下线程数sendMessageThreadPoolNums，开启transientStorePoolEnable减少刷盘毛刺。可以执行下distribution/bin/os.sh脚本优化一下操作系统参数，特别是一些脏页writeback参数、IO请求调度算法等，另外尽量不要使用swap分区，需要通过工具来复现找出具体原因。\r\n\r\n和issue428应该没有什么关系，刷盘慢是原因，timeout是结果。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/731016501/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/731023220","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/1108#issuecomment-731023220","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/1108","id":731023220,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczMTAyMzIyMA==","user":{"login":"lwclover","id":4252409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNTI0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4252409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lwclover","html_url":"https://github.com/lwclover","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lwclover/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lwclover/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lwclover/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lwclover/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lwclover/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lwclover/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lwclover/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lwclover/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lwclover/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-20T08:30:12Z","updated_at":"2020-11-20T08:33:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"**this

There are many similar articles that you can refer to[1][2][3].

In addition, you can see if the subscription information under the same consumer group is consistent. If the problem still cannot be solved, it is recommended to provide some key information such as rocketmq_client.log\r\n\r\nthanks to follow my question, i use native client test same topic with same consumer group, it work fine. but switch to my service also delay,  so i guess may be my service code problem\r\ni compare different between my service to rocketmq-4.6.0-release, found use different netty-all.jar, so i config netty.jar hope it's helpful. but the problem still cannot be solved, later i will put some rocketmq_client.log\r\nhere my service pom & consume code, i couldn't find any different from quckstart example , i was confused\r\n```\r\n        <dependency>\r\n\t
