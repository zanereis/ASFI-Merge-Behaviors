like the proposed idea. 👍 \r\n\r\nMy thoughts:\r\n\r\n1) Maintainability\r\nSince we have many interfaces for policies (API for 3 languages, CLI, and REST), maintainability is unignorable. Replacing all individual interfaces with a simple get / set interface would absolutely improve maintainability of the code. And it would also be good for compatibility.\r\n\r\n2) Approachability\r\nPeople like code completion. From my experience, list of properties / methods are really useful especially when you use unfamiliar libraries. It tells you not only candidates, but also features you didn't know. To me, losing it would be a pain and documentation wouldn't be enough complement. However, I'd be happy if type of `policyProperty` in the proposal is `Enum` because I would be able to see the list. Of course we need to maintain the enum, but maintaining enum entries should be much easier than maintaining methods.\r\n\r\n3) Data types\r\nWhat need to be checked for a policy and the policy name should be 1:1, as far as I know. Looking up a `PolicyValidator` doesn't sound difficult to me.\r\n\r\nNitpick) REST

However, which zookeeper client cache thing seems to be able to handle some errors by creating a new client.  And it's caching data, only updating with watchers. There's no guarantee that when your create succeeds the watchers will have run. Quite the opposite in fact, as the server will respond with success for the write first and then trigger the watchers.\r\n\r\nI think the sleep is trying to solve a different problem though.
