Couple of minor changes\n1.  JDK version in the pom.xml is 1.8. You would need to downgrade to 1.7\n2.  For the ProductRDDFunctions.scala file, I notice a mismatch in the package declaration.\n3. Would be ideal if we could have a scala file say PhoenixSparkContext that merges the functionality you have written in ProductRDDFunctions and  SparkContextFunctions .\n4. Renaming SparkSqlContextFunctions to just PhoenixSparkSqlContext to make easier for end users.\n5. The build goes through fine but when I try to run the PhoenixRDDTest from a ScalaIDE , I keep getting errors. It could be more of a IDE thing which i will fix and get back on tests results. \n\nGood to haves\n1.

The original phoenix-spark library would not work with 1.7 for some reason, but that may no longer be the case.\n\n2: Good catch. I think IntelliJ did something a little funny here on me, that file was supposed to be in the main hierarchy.\n\n3 / 4: It's my first kick at extending Spark (and Phoenix for that matter), but the naming scheme and file separation was modelled off of DataStax' Spark-Cassandra connector, which I figured is as good a model as any:\nhttps://github.com/datastax/spark-cassandra-connector/tree/master/spark-cassandra-connector/src/main/scala/com/datastax/spark/connector\n\nIn theory, doing it that way means a user can have just one import to get all the nice implicit definitions:\n`import org.apache.phoenix.spark._`\n\n5: I've never had much luck with getting the Scala integration working well on any IDE, I just run 'mvn test' from the CLI.\n\nRe: Good to haves\n1. I totally agree, but I don't think I can afford the cycles at the moment. My hope was that by modelling after the spark-cassandra-connector, it would be relatively painless to add for either a third party, or myself in the hopefully not-too-distant-future.\n2. Great idea, I hadn't actually seen that usage with Spark SQL yet. We're still using the RDD API internally. On a quick glance it looks fairly straight-forward to implement.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/88176830/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/88178852","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/phoenix/pull/59#issuecomment-88178852","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/59","id":88178852,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg4MTc4ODUy","user":{"login":"mravi","id":143650,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzY1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/143650?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravi","html_url":"https://github.com/mravi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-31T17:27:15Z","updated_at":"2015-03-31T17:27:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jmahonin  I can join forces with you on the Good to haves \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/88178852/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/88179901","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/phoenix/pull/59#issuecomment-88179901","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/59","id":88179901,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg4MTc5OTAx","user":{"login":"jmahonin","id":2280043,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODAwNDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2280043?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmahonin","html_url":"https://github.com/jmahonin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmahonin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmahonin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmahonin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmahonin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmahonin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmahonin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmahonin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmahonin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmahonin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-31T17:31:22Z","updated_at":"2015-03-31T17:31:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mravi Great.
