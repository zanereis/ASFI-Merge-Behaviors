I'm afraid that it can't work when the composite columns have the same nested field name. Such as a table schema `student<name, age>, teacher<name, age>`, and the projected fields are `name, age`, we can't determine whether the `name` is `student.name` or `teacher.name`.\r\n\r\nIMO, we can use the full qualifier column names with `.` separator to represent the (nested) fields. For the above example, the projected fields could be `student.name, teacher.age`. And then we can use it to do nested field projection push down.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think ? \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJark Wu","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/277945223/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/277953103","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3112#issuecomment-277953103","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3112","id":277953103,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3Nzk1MzEwMw==","user":{"login":"rmetzger","id":89049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger","html_url":"https://github.com/rmetzger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-07T10:01:41Z","updated_at":"2017-02-07T10:01:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 to merge.\r\n\r\nI've tried the ES2 connector (just to check one of the connectors) and it worked well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/277953103/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/277955988","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3112#issuecomment-277955988","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3112","id":277955988,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3Nzk1NTk4OA==","user":{"login":"tzulitai","id":5284370,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODQzNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5284370?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai","html_url":"https://github.com/tzulitai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-07T10:14:36Z","updated_at":"2017-02-07T10:14:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you for the review @rmetzger!

The translation removes the group-by expression from the aggregate and adds the same expression as a window.\r\n\r\nNote that `ROWTIME()` is actually translated to a call to the local timestamp. The expression has to be executable because Calcite creates a new project operator to compute the group-by expression, where the expression has to be executed. For example, the following query\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM table GROUP BY FLOOR(ROWTIME() TO HOUR)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill be translated to:\r\n\r\n```\r\nLogicalAggregate(group={$0}, agg={COUNT(*)})\r\n  LogicalProject($0=FLOOR(ROWTIME() TO HOUR))\r\n  ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's tempting to remove the group-by expression from the logical plan. However, it cannot be done using the optimization frameworks in Calcite. These frameworks expect the output types of the operators stay the same before and after the transformations. Removing the field actually changes the types thus Calcite will complain.\r\n\r\nThe down side of this approach is that it might be difficult for Flink to catch malformed queries such as `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table GROUP BY FLOOR(ROWTIME() / 2 TO HOUR)` at compile-time.

I think it's super cool (and long overdue) to finally have this. I think the general approach is sound and has good things going for it.\r\n\r\nBut I see two problems with maintaining the current implementation in the long run:\r\n- Changing a URL in the web dashboard requires that we also change it in the history server file generation. It's easy to accidentally break the history server and it's cumbersome to write tests when we extend it.\r\n- We have all JSON generation in the JsonUtil. That results in a giant class (as you say) that is really tightly coupled to the handlers but resides in a different place.\r\n\r\nI think we can word around this by moving the archival logic to the handlers. I think it's fair that handlers that want to take part in historical archiving implement their archival logic on their own. The handlers would need to return their path and also their JSON. That way we keep all the handler logic in one place for both the regular frontend and history server. A \"historic execution graph\" might be a simple collection of `path, JSON` entries that the history server persists on receive.\r\n\r\nAnother minor thing is that the final status of the operators is missing on the history server. I don't know whether that is a front end issue or something is missing in the JSON.\r\n\r\nI think it's best to close this PR for now and think about how we want to extend this a bit for better maintainability.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/278729401/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/278789830","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2733#issuecomment-278789830","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2733","id":278789830,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3ODc4OTgzMA==","user":{"login":"greghogan","id":569655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2OTY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/569655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan","html_url":"https://github.com/greghogan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-09T22:07:07Z","updated_at":"2017-02-24T16:21:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vasia Running on a c4.xlarge with 4 slots and a 4 GB preallocated TaskManager heap.

Could you please have a look?\r\n\r\nThe major change was to refactor the `DummyFlinkKafkaProducer` so that a simple mock `KafkaProducer` can be provided for tests where a simple `verify(mockProducer).send(...)` is sufficient. The refactored version also has the advantage that it makes sure the `Callback` implementation in the connector is correct (correctly decrements `pendingRecords` value).\r\n\r\nNote: the only thing I could not really improve is the `testAtLeastOnceProducer` test. Like before, the refactored version is still essentially continuously checking whether the snapshot method has returned early. The test is definitely stable, just that I don't think there is a better approach for it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/278899054/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/278916404","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3149#issuecomment-278916404","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3149","id":278916404,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3ODkxNjQwNA==","user":{"login":"ramkrish86","id":3690658,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2OTA2NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3690658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86","html_url":"https://github.com/ramkrish86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-10T11:01:24Z","updated_at":"2017-02-10T11:06:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks to @tonycox  for helping me in reproducing this error.

, I have submitted the updates that may cover your suggestions.\r\n\r\nThere are still two issues that I am not confirmed.\r\n\r\nFirst, for heartbeat interval and timeout default values in `ConfigConstants`, they are not invalid currently and you can modify it with your professional experience.\r\n\r\nSecond, the introduction of `ScheduledExecutorService` in `RPCService`, my initial idea is trying to use the existing scheduler in `RPCService`, but it can not be got from `AkkaRPCService` implementation. Another way is to replace the current `ScheduledExecutorService` parameter with `RPCService` in construction of `HeartbeatManagerSenderImpl`, and the `RPCService` can also schedule the heartbeat request. But the return value of `scheduleRunnable` method in `RPCService` is conflict with that in `HeartbeatManagerSenderImpl`. So I just bring another single thread pool in `RPCService` for use currently. Maybe the number of threads in pool can refer to number of cpu cores.\r\n\r\nMaybe there are still something to be polished, and I am willing for further modifications by your comments.\r\nBTW, the heartbeat interaction between TM and RM will be submitted in another PR after this confirmation because of some common points.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/279008233/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/279018628","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3293#issuecomment-279018628","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3293","id":279018628,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3OTAxODYyOA==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-10T18:01:31Z","updated_at":"2017-02-10T18:01:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"#3290 is in","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/279018628/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/279081000","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3192#issuecomment-279081000","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3192","id":279081000,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3OTA4MTAwMA==","user":{"login":"skonto","id":7945591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDU1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7945591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto","html_url":"https://github.com/skonto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-10T22:14:12Z","updated_at":"2017-02-10T22:14:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@sachingoel0101 np as soon as you are ready let me know.
