To use this example testing the Async pull, we need to change the line 680 in DefaultLitePullConsumerImpl into `PullTaskImpl pullTask = new PullTaskImpl(messageQueue, CommunicationMode.ASYNC);`\r\n\r\nHere is the conclusion of its performance.\r\n1. When the message is consumed **successfully**,\r\nDifferent queues will run in concurrently, while the message in the same queue will be consumed orderly. We can check the QueueId and QueueOffset of messageExts to confirm it. I think this meets our expectations.\r\n\r\n2. When the message is consumed **unsuccessfully**,\r\nThe exception will call the onException() in the pullCallback we defined in line 989. The pullDelayTimeMills will be changed according to the type of the exception. It will be set as the delay of the scheduledThreadPoolExecutor.\r\n\r\nThat's all of the test. I would appreciate if you have any better idea of the test and I'm happy to do anything I can to improve it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1500143600/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1500733692","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/4117#issuecomment-1500733692","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/4117","id":1500733692,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl85Zc2D8","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-08T00:06:41Z","updated_at":"2023-04-08T00:06:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue is stale because it has been open for 365 days with no activity.

The defaultMQAdminExt provided KV-related interface currently. Theoretically, users can use this capabilities anyway;\r\n2. The MQAdmin tools provided update and delete capabilities, users like me may just need a convenient way to check if the updateKVConfig operation is effective(Of course, this part of the data does not put a huge read/write strain on namesrv)\r\n\r\nSo I think we should remove all the associated interfaces **after** we decide that namesrv will no longer play the role of kv.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1507996955/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1509410260","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/4162#issuecomment-1509410260","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/4162","id":1509410260,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl85Z98XU","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-15T00:07:55Z","updated_at":"2023-04-15T00:07:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue is stale because it has been open for 365 days with no activity.
