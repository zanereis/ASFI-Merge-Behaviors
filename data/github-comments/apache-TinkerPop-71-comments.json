But I also had to make another change as my fix wasn't complete. It did solve the problem that the `Connection` class had an ever increasing list of cancellation registrations, but those registrations weren't disposed and were therefore still stored in the underlying `CancellationTokenSource`.\r\nWe've found that by trying out the fix in the service where we initially found the memory leak. The earlier fix here already improved the situation a lot but a memory dump revealed that the `CancellationTokenSource` had a linked list of all cancellation registrations.\r\nThe version that is now in this PR doesn't show any increasing memory usage any more.

I'm always happy to see new users submitting improvements to TinkerPop. It looks like there are many more cases where the deprecated camelCase methods are still being used internally (mostly in the tests). It would be good to get these all updated at some point. Anyways that isn't a blocker for this PR.\r\n\r\nJust to give a bit of context as to how our review process works, typically any PR needs 3 VOTE +1's from approved committers to be merged. It can also be merged with a minimum of 1 vote after a week has passed. In your case here, as this is such a small change, a committer may choose to skip the full process and push it in as a CTR (Commit then Review).\r\n\r\nI'm not a committer here so the best I can do is give a VOTE +1

It'll be great to have warnings which tells you that you aren't building the GLVs, but I'm not sure if it's necessarily worth adding an entire profile for each of the GLVs for this, given that there is documentation about them, and also we are considering removing the need to use `.glv` in 3.7.0 (as they were initially added due to GLV tests required environment set-up, but we are now using Docker which should be able to remove that need). Would there be an easier way to add the warning in an existing profile?\r\n\r\nThis was the best method for adding some sort of warning that I could find. It is possible there are better solutions but I don't think it's worth investing much time in. I think this warning would be helpful for current developers, we can remove these profiles once the `.glv` system is torn out.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1577557867/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1578148731","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2087#issuecomment-1578148731","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/2087","id":1578148731,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc5eEKN7","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-06T08:11:54Z","updated_at":"2023-07-21T21:50:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## [Codecov](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2087?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=apache) Report\n> Merging [#2087](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2087?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=apache) (8ad895f) into [master](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/tinkerpop/commit/0afd3a5d54531e882a48ca461483621a4c5c65c2?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=apache) (0afd3a5) will **decrease** coverage by `4.59%`.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n```diff\n@@             Coverage Diff              @@\n##             master    #2087      +/-   ##\n============================================\n- Coverage     74.87%   70.29%   -4.59%     \n============================================\n  Files          1029       24    -1005     \n  Lines         62355     3541   -58814     \n  Branches       6887        0    -6887     \n============================================\n- Hits          46690     2489   -44201     \n+ Misses        13113      881   -12232     \n+ Partials       2552      171    -2381     \n```\n\n\n[see 1007 files with indirect coverage changes](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2087/indirect-changes?src=pr&el=tree-more&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=apache)\n\n:mega: We’re building smart automated test selection to slash your CI/CD build times.
