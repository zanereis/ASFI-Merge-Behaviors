I would be kind of scared of type erasure in the K implements Key case :-S \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/139820404/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/139822550","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/892#issuecomment-139822550","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/892","id":139822550,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzOTgyMjU1MA==","user":{"login":"andralungu","id":2550549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTA1NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2550549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu","html_url":"https://github.com/andralungu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-12T21:58:14Z","updated_at":"2015-09-12T21:58:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think it's safe to open a fresh PR... fixing this one would be overkill.

HDFS Sink is to dispatch data into multiple directories depending of attributes present in source events.\n\nFor example, let's say we have some data that have a timestamp and status fields, one can specify in Flume conf file to write data into different directories like this:\nhadfs.path=/somepath/%{timestamp}/%{status}\nThe result will be to write data into multiple folders like \n/somepath/some_timestamp/wellformed\n/somepath/some_timestamp/malformed\n/somepath/some_timestamp/incomplete \n... \netc\n\nTo achieve this, Flume maintains a LRU Hashmap to hold not one but a set of Writers, and computes the destination path for each event.\nIt also uses some params like maxOpenfFiles, idleTimeOut(optional, used to close a file after x seconds of inactivity) to ensure not having too many open files.\n\nBut to include this, the bucketing, cleanOnStartup and the checkpointing logics need to be

The one we currently have in Gelly (and this one) applies the optimization that the vertex with the lowest ID will be the one detecting the triangle.\n\n@andralungu, we have chosen these implementations for your thesis in order to test a specific method and prove a point.

@vasia ,\n\nThere was no clear rejection in the discussion, so I thought I'd try my luck :)\n\nThis technique could be enabled by using a flag only if we introduce a node split version of all the

Otherwise, for newly written code, users would still have to pass a combine function according to their algorithm. They'd also have to pass the threshold that differentiates high-degree vertices from low-degree vertices. What is more, they still need to split and aggregate before and after each step.\n\nThese are aspects that cannot be guessed and that highly depend on the algorithm. \n\nAlso, what I had in mind regarding this PR was that we would discuss and  try to improve the code a bit, rather than immediately discarding it :(\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/140131099/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/140133538","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1105#issuecomment-140133538","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1105","id":140133538,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MDEzMzUzOA==","user":{"login":"andralungu","id":2550549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTA1NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2550549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu","html_url":"https://github.com/andralungu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-14T16:25:34Z","updated_at":"2015-09-14T16:25:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hey you two :)\n\nI suggest that we add this one. \nLet the JIRA that @vasia opened handle the keys.\nThen add the DataSet example (another JIRA) and a JIRA for benchmarks.\n\nI think that would more or less make everyone happy. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/140133538/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/140137717","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1105#issuecomment-140137717","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1105","id":140137717,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MDEzNzcxNw==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-14T16:36:52Z","updated_at":"2015-09-14T16:36:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Fair enough, we can stick with your implementation.

I'm trying to save you some time.\n\nSo, my opinion is that in order for this to be useful, we need 2 things:\n- Understand the performance implications of the method. When is it beneficial? What's the memory overhead? What's the pre-processing overhead? How does it depend on the input? What if I give a wrong threshold? etc.\n- Make this as automatic as possible. Ideally, the user would only have to give the combiner function and the threshold. Splitting and merge should be handled internally. Actually, we could probably find ways to automatically determine the threshold, too, based on the graph, the current load and the available memory.\n\nThese are not easy tasks and will need a lot of work. That's why I'm proposing to link to the current state of this method from the Gelly docs, so that we can get feedback. We could create something like a \"research projects on Gelly\" page, where we link to work in progress from our roadmap tasks.\n\nThat's just my view, but let's see what other people think :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/140146467/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/140148408","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1125#issuecomment-140148408","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1125","id":140148408,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MDE0ODQwOA==","user":{"login":"mxm","id":837221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNzIyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/837221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm","html_url":"https://github.com/mxm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-14T17:15:52Z","updated_at":"2015-09-14T17:15:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing this in favor of #1129.

Should be extend Streaming API for this?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/140224226/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/140239647","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1106#issuecomment-140239647","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1106","id":140239647,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MDIzOTY0Nw==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-15T00:19:18Z","updated_at":"2015-09-15T00:19:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The tests use the shell scripts (`.sh` or `.bat`) to start the Scala Shell and rely on finding these scripts in the `flink-dist/target` folder.

I haven't checked the semantic of the `TaskOperationResult` but it might be the case that the JM upon receiving this messages thinks that the stop call was successfully executed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/140335366/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/140336732","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1129#issuecomment-140336732","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1129","id":140336732,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MDMzNjczMg==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-15T09:32:26Z","updated_at":"2015-09-15T09:32:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the PR @mxm.\nI left a few comments inline. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/140336732/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/140343995","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1097#issuecomment-140343995","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1097","id":140343995,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MDM0Mzk5NQ==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-15T10:08:12Z","updated_at":"2015-09-15T10:08:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the PR @mliesenberg!\nCan you add the checks (and tests to verify the checks are working) that I mentioned in my comments?\nThe original JIRA issue also included type checks.

Do you want to update the edge values or simply read them?\nLet me know if I can help :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/140669850/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/140730955","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1135#issuecomment-140730955","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1135","id":140730955,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MDczMDk1NQ==","user":{"login":"rmetzger","id":89049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger","html_url":"https://github.com/rmetzger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-16T12:46:01Z","updated_at":"2015-09-16T12:46:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"There is a test failure\n\n```\n StormWrapperSetupHelperTest.testCreateTopologyContext:190 Â» ClassCast class su...\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/140730955/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/140731019","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/885#issuecomment-140731019","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/885","id":140731019,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MDczMTAxOQ==","user":{"login":"rmetzger","id":89049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger","html_url":"https://github.com/rmetzger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-16T12:46:24Z","updated_at":"2015-09-16T12:46:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I agree.
