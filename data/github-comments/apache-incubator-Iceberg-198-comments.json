Thanks for the link but that discussion is also a few months old and I didn't really see a conclusion.\r\n\r\nMy mostly uninformed opinion is that there currently is a battle in this space for the predominant table format between Iceberg and Delta. From what I've seen Iceberg looks like the better format but is less well supported. Delta has good Rust support. I'd like to set up a small scale Data Lakehouse with Iceberg and DuckDB but I don't want to go near a JVM. Having a good Rust implementation with a nice Python wrapper would do wonders here.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1238560062/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1238567564","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/5710#issuecomment-1238567564","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/5710","id":1238567564,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85J0wqM","user":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-06T19:30:51Z","updated_at":"2022-09-06T19:30:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Original one works like a charm","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1238567564/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1238609483","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/5122#issuecomment-1238609483","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/5122","id":1238609483,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85J065L","user":{"login":"JanKaul","id":19823005,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5ODIzMDA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19823005?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JanKaul","html_url":"https://github.com/JanKaul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JanKaul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JanKaul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JanKaul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JanKaul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JanKaul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JanKaul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JanKaul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JanKaul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JanKaul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-06T20:18:52Z","updated_at":"2022-09-06T20:18:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I'm currently trying to extend the existing https://github.com/oliverdaff/iceberg-rs repo to get a working rust iceberg implementation.

WRITE ORDER BY ...` was the [SQL extension](https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/latest/spark-ddl/#alter-table--write-ordered-by) that Ryan was referring to. It seems like it was later [implemented](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/1c158df94bf004d43867939841e75e4bfb941c16/spark/v3.1/spark-extensions/src/main/antlr/org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.parser.extensions/IcebergSqlExtensions.g4#L73) but it seems like it only works for [Spark>=3.2](https://tabular.io/blog/whats-new-in-iceberg-0.13/).\r\n\r\nI did try to use this SQL extension before inserting to a partitioned table, but it didn't seem to work, possibly I didn't do it right (I am on Spark 3.1 and our job is written in SparkSQL). We did, however, try a few other suggestions Ryan gave in the other threads:\r\n\r\n* `fan out writer` - This didn't work for us, possibly because we have DS partitioned table that can go back to as early as 2008, so we are opening thousands of files and the overhead is too big.\r\n* `sorting` - we tried global sort (`ORDER BY`), local sort (`SORT BY`), and also `CLUSTER BY`, and they all worked, but obviously with varying cost & performance! \r\n\r\nI heard that this will be handled transparently starting in Spark 3.3 and users no longer have to explicitly sort their data before INSERT into a partitioned table.
