However, stricly speaking it should not be a regression because those recovery modes previously did not support state recovery at all.

I came here with several questions in mind. I do understand that it needs to implement:\r\n\r\n- migration tests of `FlinkKafkaProducer011` between Flink versions\r\n- migration test from `FlinkKafkaProducer011` to universal `FlinkKafkaProducer`\r\n\r\nBut for migration tests of universal `FlinkKafkaProducer` between Flink versions :  I read in the doc that this connector is supported since flink 1.7 . So currently,  no migration test should be passing ? \r\n\r\nAlso, do we just want to check that the connector can start from a previous version checkpoint ?\r\n\r\nFurthermore I've worked on a simple implementation of Migration test for `FlinkKafkaProducer`: \r\nhttps://github.com/tvielgouarin/flink/commit/973756430c226a0cd5011fedc1eab1345a27cc2a\r\n\r\nMost of the time the test fail with `The producer attempted to use a producer id which is not currently assigned to its transactional id`. I'm not sure, but I guess it's because there is a different KafkaServer's instance between the snapshot version and the test, and the transactional Id assignations are lost (?). If so, do you have and idea of the the best work around ? \r\n\r\nAnyway if you can have a look at what I've done and criticize it, it would be much appreciated.

So currently, no migration test should be passing \r\n\r\nBoth for the universal and `FlinkKafkaProducer011` the most important test to catch regressions is to test restoring from savepoint that was taken using the latest stable version (`1.7`). It would test if current code in the master (future `1.8` release) has state compatibility with `1.7` savepoints.\r\n\r\n> Also, do we just want to check that the connector can start from a previous version checkpoint ?\r\n\r\nI think at least for now only checking the compatibility with `1.7` is enough.\r\n\r\n> Most of the time the test fail with `The producer attempted to use a producer id which is not currently assigned to its transactional id`\r\n \r\nI guess your test is failing because you are restoring Flink's state from savepoint correctly, but you are ignoring the state of Kafka brokers. I haven't thought about this issue before and it looks like nobody else did it as well... By the way, thanks for discovering this issue. I guess this is the first migration test that must take care of some external state (besides Flink's internal state). Probably Kafka migration tests must store not only \"savepoint\" in the resources but also in one way or another store the state of kafka cluster as it was just after completing the savepoint from which we want to restore (transaction log? topics content?) Whatever that means... 😕Couple of random thoughts:\r\n\r\n1. it might be possible to identify the list of files that define the internal state of Kafka that we need to archive, place it in the resources alongside of savepoint and use it during `KafkaTestBase` initialisation\r\n2. maybe it will be better to express this logic in end to end test?\r\n\r\nCC @tzulitai ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/456466692/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/456470455","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/7529#issuecomment-456470455","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/7529","id":456470455,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NjQ3MDQ1NQ==","user":{"login":"GJL","id":1681921,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODE5MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1681921?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJL","html_url":"https://github.com/GJL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-22T16:42:31Z","updated_at":"2019-01-22T16:42:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Are you planning to use the `NoOpTransientBlobService` somewhere else?

This PR should also support MesosResourceManager. Let me rephrase the title of the JIRA ticket.\r\n\r\n2)Yes, It should be disabled by default. I can simply initialize the default value of maximum Number of allowed failure executor as Integer.MAX_VALUE.\r\n\r\n3) There are several type of failure scenarios. \r\n- When start a new container, there is a namenode failover or hdfs is down. Then, the container can't fetch job jar to bootstrap.\r\n- We allocate hdfs quota for each job's checkpoint folder. When quota is hit, containers will consistently fail, and restart strategy will restart the job by allocating more containers. In this condition, a job will continue to run for a while, but the job is actually in wrong state.\r\n\r\nI prefer to add the threshold on job rather than whole cluster. But when i jump into implementation. I found it is hard to distinguish which allocated container is for which job master in YarnResourceManager.

Much appreciated. \r\n\r\nI checked the code and played a little bit with your implementation. Your `FlinkKafkaProducerMigrationTest` looks correct, but before we deal with this failure prerequisite is to have such state of the migration code, that the following simplest test should also be working:\r\n```\r\n\t@Test\r\n\tpublic void testReuseKafkaTempDirectory() throws Exception {\r\n\t\tassertExactlyOnceForTopic(createProperties(), topic, 0, Arrays.asList(43));\r\n\t}\r\n```  \r\nIt should work, since in `writeSnapshot` you `testHarness.notifyOfCompletedCheckpoint(1L);` for the stored snapshot before closing KafkaProducer. The issue that I was referring in the Jira would be if you would comment out `notifyOfCompletedCheckpoint(1L)` call - that would leave \"pending\" open transactions in Kafka. But before we tackle this one, my proposed `testReuseKafkaTempDirectory()` assertion should be passing. In this scenario restoring from such snapshot should be almost a no-op (% aborting pending transactions).\r\n\r\nI think the issue might be that you didn't back up the ZooKeeper state. As far as I remember (and [this article](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-back-up-import-and-migrate-your-apache-kafka-data-on-ubuntu-18-04) confirms that) backup-ing some ZooKeeper directories is also necessary.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/457577382/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/457607582","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/7020#issuecomment-457607582","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/7020","id":457607582,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NzYwNzU4Mg==","user":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-25T15:22:38Z","updated_at":"2019-01-25T16:12:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I took another look at the problem and came up with the following refactoring https://github.com/tillrohrmann/flink/tree/FLINK-10774.

What about introducing a failure rate instead of a total number of failures? We could say we allow so and so many container failures per hour. If this number is exceeded, then fail all pending slot requests with a container failure rate exception.\r\n3. By having a failure rate it might be ok to not account the failure for each job individually because the cluster can still recover after some time and won't be useless for future job submissions. Atm there is no way to find out the mapping between containers and jobs. The idea is that free TaskManager from another job can be used for serving slot requests of another job. It would actually be good if only unexpected container completions (e.g. if a container dies) would be counted for the failure rate. If a TM disconnects, then we should not increase the failure counter because it might still be there.\r\n4. Yes temporarily we should let `MaximumFailedTaskManagerExceedingException` extend from `SuppressRestartException`. I think what we should do as a follow up is to extend the `RestartStrategy` such that it knows about the failure reason. That way, it would be possible to implement a custom `RestartStrategy` which can treat failures differently (e.g. `MaximumFailedTaskManagerExceedingException`).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/457619260/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/457626068","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/7546#issuecomment-457626068","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/7546","id":457626068,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NzYyNjA2OA==","user":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-25T16:14:57Z","updated_at":"2019-01-25T16:14:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"PR does not build because of \r\n```\r\nsrc/test/java/org/apache/flink/yarn/YARNSessionCapacitySchedulerITCase.java:[94,15] (imports) UnusedImports: Unused import: org.junit.Assume.assumeTrue.\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/457626068/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/457629435","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/7546#issuecomment-457629435","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/7546","id":457629435,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NzYyOTQzNQ==","user":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-25T16:24:44Z","updated_at":"2019-01-25T16:24:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hmm `YARNSessionCapacitySchedulerITCase` actually uses `assumeTrue`.

Unfortunately the registered factory is not propagated to `AvroSerializer` via `getProducedType`, what will result in a failure if it is used for non-chained operators.\r\n\r\nI think if we want to fix it properly and completely we should do a similar thing for `AvroTypeInfo`/`GenericRecordAvroTypeInfo`/`AvroSerializer`.\r\n\r\nA workaround that I am aware of for this issue without any changes on flink side would be to use `conversions` field for SpecificData, but unfortunately it is broken for avro <= 1.9, if logical types are used for unions, arrays etc. (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AVRO-2065, https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AVRO-1891).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/458035366/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/458039204","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/7581#issuecomment-458039204","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/7581","id":458039204,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1ODAzOTIwNA==","user":{"login":"twalthr","id":5746567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDY1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5746567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr","html_url":"https://github.com/twalthr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-28T08:36:43Z","updated_at":"2019-01-28T08:36:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The Blink code can be found in https://github.com/apache/flink/tree/blink branch.
