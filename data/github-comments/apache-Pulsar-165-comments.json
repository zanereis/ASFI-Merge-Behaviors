Let me explain in details.\r\nPulsar website use docusaurus as framework. \r\nPreviously, we've tried to remove all those obsolete files, and it resulted to link failure for versions earlier than 2.4.1. And then @tuteng added all those obsolete files back to the `docs` folder. There was no link issues for the current version and earlier versions. However, contributors felt confused why those obsolete files are there in the master, and not sure which file to update. \r\n\r\nWe're trying to remove all those obsolete files, yet it would inevitably affect links in earlier versions. Those obsolete files were used in earlier versions, and we have to maintain doc content in the earlier versions unchanged, and keep only latest doc content in the master. So @tuteng comes with the solution: keep the obsolete files name in the master(with empty content), move the obsolete files and contents to earlier versions.\r\n\r\nIf you have any better idea on this, feel free to contact us.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/555900121/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/555902188","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/5684#issuecomment-555902188","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/5684","id":555902188,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NTkwMjE4OA==","user":{"login":"candlerb","id":44789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0Nzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/candlerb","html_url":"https://github.com/candlerb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/candlerb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/candlerb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/candlerb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/candlerb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/candlerb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/candlerb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/candlerb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/candlerb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/candlerb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-20T08:47:07Z","updated_at":"2019-11-20T08:47:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"That doesn't make sense for my test cluster.

Each node has one SSD disk for both journal and ledger directory.\r\n2) setup a broker with 10 nodes.\r\n3) create a topic with 20 partitions.\r\n4) launch a flink job with a data-generator source (without throttling) and a flink pulsar sink (https://github.com/streamnative/pulsar-flink), with parallelism == 20. The producer setting in the pulsar sink is the default producer setting.\r\n5) run the flink job for a while. you can observe the OOM very quickly.\r\n\r\nThe heapdump of broker shows a lot of pending entries because the flink job is producing more than the bookkeeper cluster can accept. so all the entries are accumulating at the broker and cause broker crash due to OOM.\r\n\r\nThe expectation is broker should degrade when reaching its capacity limitation and give back pressure to the clients. Broker shouldn't crash due to OOM.\r\n\r\nIf we don't provide the capability as Jia proposed in #5710, pulsar can't be used in high-volume ingestion workload.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/556266528/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/556267324","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/5710#issuecomment-556267324","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/5710","id":556267324,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NjI2NzMyNA==","user":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-20T19:14:59Z","updated_at":"2019-11-20T19:14:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@rdhabalia commented at #5513 with the instructions to reproduce.
