4.9.3 的ACL变更功能无法使用，无论是使用mqadmin还是手动修改plain_acl.yml文件，都会导致ACL失效（至少所有account的相关内容失效）\r\n\r\n测试方法如下(对/conf/acl/plain_acl.yml 和 /conf/plain_acl.yml的测试结果相同)：\r\n\r\n1. 在 plain_acl.yml 中写入如下内容:\r\n\r\n```\r\naccounts:\r\n- accessKey: PG-E-APP-YYY\r\n  secretKey: 12345678\r\n  whiteRemoteAddress:\r\n  admin: false\r\n  defaultTopicPerm: DENY\r\n  defaultGroupPerm: DENY\r\n  topicPerms:\r\n  - TP-E-APP-YYY=PUB\r\n  - RMQ_SYS_TRACE_TOPIC=SUB\r\n  groupPerms:\r\n- accessKey: CG-E-APP-YYY-APP-SVC\r\n  secretKey: 12345678\r\n  whiteRemoteAddress:\r\n  admin: false\r\n  defaultTopicPerm: DENY\r\n  defaultGroupPerm: DENY\r\n  topicPerms:\r\n  - TP-E-APP-YYY=SUB\r\n  - RMQ_SYS_TRACE_TOPIC=SUB\r\n  groupPerms:\r\n  # the group should convert to retry topic\r\n  - CG-E-APP-YYY-APP-SVC=SUB\r\n```\r\n\r\nStep2. 重启 NameSrv 和 Broker\r\n\r\nStep3. 使用下列代码，验证消息生产和消费（带有ACL）；可以正常生产消费\r\n\r\nProducer：\r\n```\r\npublic class AclProducer {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args)\r\n            throws MQClientException, InterruptedException, RemotingException, MQBrokerException {\r\n        DefaultMQProducer producer = new DefaultMQProducer(\"My-Producer-YYY\", getAclRPCHook(), true, null);\r\n        producer.setNamesrvAddr(\"10.155.100.8:19876;10.155.101.213:19876\");\r\n        producer.start();\r\n        for (int i

//msg.setDelayTimeLevel(6);\r\n                SendResult sendResult = producer.send(msg);\r\n                System.out.printf(\"%s%n\", sendResult);\r\n                Thread.sleep(10);\r\n            } catch (Exception e) {\r\n                e.printStackTrace();\r\n                Thread.sleep(1000);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        producer.shutdown();\r\n    }\r\n    static RPCHook getAclRPCHook() {\r\n        return new AclClientRPCHook(new SessionCredentials(\"PG-E-APP-YYY\",\"12345678\"));\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nConsumer：\r\n```\r\npublic class AclConsumer {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws MQClientException {\r\n        DefaultMQPushConsumer consumer = new DefaultMQPushConsumer(\r\n                \"CG-E-APP-YYY-APP-SVC\", getAclRPCHook(), new AllocateMessageQueueAveragely(), true, null);\r\n        consumer.setConsumeFromWhere(ConsumeFromWhere.CONSUME_FROM_FIRST_OFFSET);\r\n        consumer.subscribe(\"TP-E-APP-YYY\", \"*\");\r\n        consumer.setNamesrvAddr(\"10.155.100.8:19876;10.155.101.213:19876\");\r\n        consumer.registerMessageListener(new MessageListenerConcurrently() {\r\n            @Override\r\n            public ConsumeConcurrentlyStatus consumeMessage(List<MessageExt> msgs,\r\n                                                            ConsumeConcurrentlyContext context) {\r\n                System.out.printf(\"%s Receive New Messages: %s %n\", Thread.currentThread().getName(), msgs);\r\n                //return ConsumeConcurrentlyStatus.CONSUME_SUCCESS;\r\n                return ConsumeConcurrentlyStatus.RECONSUME_LATER;\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n        consumer.start();\r\n        System.out.printf(\"Consumer Started.%n\");\r\n    }\r\n    static RPCHook

文件，但是不做任何修改，仅仅:wq退出（文件内容没有变化，仅仅文件修改时间变化）\r\n\r\nStep5. 使用相同代码，验证消息生产和消费（带ACL）；无法正常生产消费，报错如下：\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.apache.rocketmq.client.exception.MQClientException: Send [3] times, still failed, cost

重启NameSrv和Broker，重新使用相同代码测试消息生产消费，生产消费正常\r\n\r\n\r\n结论：\r\nBroker运行过程中，任何针对 plain_acl.yml 文件的修改（即使不修改文件内容，仅仅修改文件之间戳），都会导致当前已有的 account ACL规则失效，相关生产消费客户端报错： \r\n\r\n>

the nature of this issue is how many sub-repositories there will be,\nand how many sub-repository can be linked with the main repository. Maybe\nyou can refer to other Apache projects for a rough range of numbers.\n\nThe key of what we do is to facilitate use for the end user. However, if\nmain repository can't link any more, it will be against the purpose of this\nproject.\n\nReference only for your PMCs, Look forward to the further discussion.\n\nBest regards,\n\nXiaorui
