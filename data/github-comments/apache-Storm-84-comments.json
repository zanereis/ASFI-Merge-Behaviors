per second per machine).</p>\n\n<p>    Upon investigation, I found that after firing a connection request, `Client.Connector` waits synchronously for the connection. Because there is only one scheduler thread per worker by default, this means only one connection request per worker process can be serviced at a time. This becomes a problem when connections are lost frequently for whatever reason, and is especially exacerbated when each connection attempt takes time.</p>\n\n<p>    Commit `aa5c2d71` changes the code so that the `Connector` fires & forgets the connection request, and lets Netty's callback thread handle the rest. There is no blocking or expensive operation done here, so using Netty's thread should be fine.</p>\n\n<p>    This change did decrease the amount of ERROR logs in my topology, but I still saw a fair amount. Upon investigation, I found that this is simply because each call to `send` produces an ERROR log. So `ad8112d10` changes the code so that a connection error is exactly logged twice; once when the connection error is detected, and the second time when the re-connection is concluded (either a successful re-connect, or permanent failure).</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:</p>\n\n<p>    $ git pull <a href=\"https://github.com/eshioji/storm\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/eshioji/storm</a> <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-763\" title=\"nimbus reassigned worker A to another machine, but other worker&#39;s netty client can&#39;t connect to the new worker A \" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-763\"><del>STORM-763</del></a></p>\n\n<p>Alternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/568.patch\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/568.patch</a></p>\n\n<p>To close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch<br/>\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:</p>\n\n<p>    This closes #568</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>commit ed8ab3ec194f19c75fc2f5c000609204f04b50e8<br/>\nAuthor: Enno Shioji <eshioji@gmail.com><br/>\nDate:   2015-05-28T19:42:05Z</p>\n\n<p>    Simplified the flow and removed the lock that was causing the deadlock</p>\n\n<p>commit 91b8eb3840432e47b79f40abebec8304627732a8<br/>\nAuthor: Enno Shioji <eshioji@gmail.com><br/>\nDate:   2015-05-28T19:46:17Z</p>\n\n<p>    Bump version</p>\n\n<p>commit b7d84bdc7fd3de34f45a94131cdbb6bfbd3763dc<br/>\nAuthor: Enno Shioji <eshioji@gmail.com><br/>\nDate:   2015-05-28T21:27:31Z</p>\n\n<p>    Remove background flushing because it doesn't seem necessary. Netty's Channel queues up written data on an unbounded buffer. The background flushing seems to have been added to avoid this, but in practice it was probably doing it anyways because flushMessages(), which is called by send() doesn't check for isWritable. Moreover, queuing on an unbounded buffer seems fine because back pressure is provided by MAX_PENDING_TUPLE.

Examples<br/>\n    +A collection of examples illustrating various capabilities.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +## Building From Source and Running<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +Checkout the projects source and perform a top level Maven build (i.e. from the `flux` directory):<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +```bash<br/>\n    +git clone <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm.git\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm.git</a><br/>\n    +cd storm<br/>\n    +mvn install -DskipTests=true<br/>\n    +```<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +This will create a shaded (i.e. \"fat\" or \"uber\") jar in the `external/flux/flux-examples/target` directory that can run/deployed with<br/>\n    +the `storm` command:<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +```bash<br/>\n    +cd flux-examples<br/>\n    +storm jar ./target/flux-examples-*-SNAPSHOT.jar org.apache.storm.flux.Flux --local ./src/main/resources/simple_wordcount.yaml<br/>\n    +```<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +The example YAML files are also packaged in the examples jar, so they can also be referenced with Flux's `--resource`<br/>\n    +command line switch:<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +```bash<br/>\n    +storm jar ./target/flux-examples-*.jar org.apache.storm.flux.Flux --local --resource /simple_wordcount.yaml<br/>\n    +```<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +## Available Examples<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +### <span class=\"error\">&#91;simple_wordcount.yaml&#93;</span>(src/main/resources/simple_wordcount.yaml)<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +This is a very basic wordcount example using Java spouts and bolts. It simply logs the running count of each word<br/>\n    +received.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +### <span class=\"error\">&#91;multilang.yaml&#93;</span>(src/main/resources/multilang.yaml)<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +Another wordcount example that uses a spout written in JavaScript (node.js), a bolt written in Python, and two bolts<br/>\n    +written in java.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +### <span class=\"error\">&#91;kafka_spout.yaml&#93;</span>(src/main/resources/kafka_spout.yaml)<br/>\n    +This example illustrates how to configure Storm's `storm-kafka` spout using Flux YAML DSL `components`, `references`,<br/>\n    +and `constructor arguments` constructs.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +### <span class=\"error\">&#91;simple_hdfs.yaml&#93;</span>(src/main/resources/simple_hdfs.yaml)<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +This example demonstrates using Flux to setup a storm-hdfs bolt to write to an HDFS cluster. It also demonstrates Flux's<br/>\n    +variable substitution/filtering feature.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +To run the `simple_hdfs.yaml` example, copy the `hdfs_bolt.properties` file to a convenient location and change, at<br/>\n    +least, the property `hdfs.url` to point to a HDFS cluster. Then you can run the example something like:<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +```bash<br/>\n    +storm jar ./target/flux-examples-*.jar org.apache.storm.flux.Flux --local ./src/main/resources/simple_hdfs.yaml --filter my_hdfs_bolt.properties<br/>\n    +```<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +### <span class=\"error\">&#91;simple_hbase.yaml&#93;</span>(src/main/resources/simple_hbase.yaml)<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +This example illustrates how to use Flux to setup a storm-hbase bolt to write to HBase.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +In order to use this example, you will need to edit the `src/main resrouces/hbase-site.xml` file to reflect your HBase<br/>\n    &#8212; End diff &#8211;</p>\n\n<p>    @ptgoetz Just a reminder, you may want to check it since it contains typo (resrouces) and hbase-site.xml file is not on directory. And actually we can run simple_hbase.yaml with similar steps from simple_hdfs.yaml.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612511315/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612515656","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4434#issuecomment-2612515656","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4434","id":2612515656,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI1MTU2NTY=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-01T04:51:17Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T13:19:48Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a

You’ll see those exceptions when using Java 1.6 to build the project.\n\nWhat is the Java version used on the build server? Is there a requirement for Java versions for Storm? I couldn’t find any info online.\n\nThe Qpid library is a must for EventHubSpout to work properly. So if we cannot change Java version requirement for Storm, I’ll have to disable a few unit tests to let it pass on Java 1.6.\n\nThanks,\nShanyu\n\nFrom: P.

Thanks for the performance testing, I could replicate very similar results on our machine. I'm trying a few things, hopefully I can get it back to where it was.\n\nIn case you haven't noticed, this change includes fix for [STORM-839](https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/566) which seems pretty critical (I actually encountered a deadlock on my live cluster). Do you think the patch should be applied to 0.9.x if the performance concern is alleviated? Or are you more thinking of 0.11.x? (I noticed you tested with 0.11)\n\nAlso I have a question, maybe @miguno could help; I've removed the graceful shutdown which tries to flush all pending message before the Client is closed, mostly to make it easier for me to fix the deadlock. However now I'm worried I might have removed something significant. Do you think I should bring it back?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/108263716/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
