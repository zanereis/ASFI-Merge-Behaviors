Starting 4.10 why not make JRE 1.8 default for CloudStack mgmt server and agents?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/240210966/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/240225750","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1642#issuecomment-240225750","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1642","id":240225750,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MDIyNTc1MA==","user":{"login":"mike-tutkowski","id":3019295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMTkyOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3019295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski","html_url":"https://github.com/mike-tutkowski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-16T20:22:04Z","updated_at":"2016-08-16T20:22:19Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Here is a screen capture of the changes to the System Service Offering dialog.\n\n[](url)\n<img width=\"393\" alt=\"system offering with storage qos\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3019295/17714367/ba238e5e-63bc-11e6-946c-ed6906739a58.png\">\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/240225750/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/240231097","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1593#issuecomment-240231097","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1593","id":240231097,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MDIzMTA5Nw==","user":{"login":"serg38","id":16176702,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTc2NzAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16176702?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38","html_url":"https://github.com/serg38","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-16T20:40:17Z","updated_at":"2016-08-16T20:40:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@jburwell LGTM for the test part.

By changing the POMs, Maven will require that Java8 in order to use CloudStack dependencies.  Furthermore, making Java8 ripples into supported Tomcat versions and Linux distributions.  Therefore, we agreed sometime ago that 4.x would support Java8, and 5.0.0 would require/default to it. Personally, I would like to adopt Java8 as soon as possible, but we have to recognize that many of our users can move so quickly.  I would also like to do it once we have Jetty embedded so that the upgrade is much simpler for users of Linux distributions because they will no longer be concerned with version matching Tomcat.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/240252155/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/240252754","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1593#issuecomment-240252754","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1593","id":240252754,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MDI1Mjc1NA==","user":{"login":"jburwell","id":285646,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTY0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/285646?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell","html_url":"https://github.com/jburwell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-16T21:58:31Z","updated_at":"2016-08-16T21:58:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@serg38 we require Marvin test results and, as well as, the results of any manual tests to be posted into the PR.

Can you share the MS logs for this issue? We need to understand the exact cause for restart of VM? When an agent/host is detected as 'Down', CS tries to check if VMs on it are alive or not, if found alive nothing is done on the VM.\n\nAlso if you think that the host got disconnected intermittently, then there are ways to adjust the timeout in CS after which it will start investigating the host status. Try adjusting the ping.timeout configuration parameter to see if the issue is resolved.\n\nThe investigation to check if VM is alive or not is done for all VMs irrespective of HA enabled or not. If a host is really down then it makes sense to mark the VMs as stopped. Additionally for HA enabled VMs, after they are successfully fenced off, attempt is made to restart them on other hosts in the cluster.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/240382323/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/240442791","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1615#issuecomment-240442791","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1615","id":240442791,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MDQ0Mjc5MQ==","user":{"login":"GabrielBrascher","id":5025148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjUxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5025148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher","html_url":"https://github.com/GabrielBrascher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-17T15:09:53Z","updated_at":"2016-08-17T15:09:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@serg38 @nvazquez the code seems ok.\nIs there anything pending with the _blueorangutan_ test?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/240442791/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/240444323","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1640#issuecomment-240444323","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1640","id":240444323,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MDQ0NDMyMw==","user":{"login":"marcaurele","id":1081566,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODE1NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1081566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcaurele","html_url":"https://github.com/marcaurele","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcaurele/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcaurele/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcaurele/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcaurele/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcaurele/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcaurele/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcaurele/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcaurele/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcaurele/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-17T15:14:13Z","updated_at":"2016-08-17T15:14:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I'll do the long explanation regarding the bug in production we had.\n\nTwice we had the VPN going down between 2 of our zones which resulted in the lost of the communication between the management server and all the agents of the other zone. After a few minutes the network went back and as the agents were reconnecting we started to see VMs being shutdown, even though we don't have HA enabled. We have 2 management servers in front of haproxy to balance agents & requests. When the network went back, the agent reconnected to the other management server 01. The server 02 had already started to issue some commands to shutdown the VM.\n\nThe important lines are here, I kept the line showing one VM being shutdown `111750`:\n\n```\nsrv02 2016-08-08

}\n\n```\n\nThe way I reproduced it in our lab is my dropping the traffic from one hypervisor to/from the management servers:\n\n```\nsudo iptables -I OUTPUT -d 10.16.13.83 -j DROP\nsudo iptables -I INPUT -s 10.16.13.83 -j DROP\n```\n\nWhen you see the host changing its state to Alert, restart the agent so that it will send quickly a `startupCommand` and re-enable the traffic if you want to see the VMs being shutdown. \n\n```\nsudo service cloudstack-agent restart\nsudo iptables -D OUTPUT -d 10.16.13.83 -j DROP\nsudo iptables -D INPUT -s 10.16.13.83 -j DROP\n```\n\nDuring that time window (right after the host/agent turned in Alert) you'll start to see AsyncJobs coming in the database to stop VMs, which is the thing I'm requesting a change for. If the agent is disconnected for enough time the commands will vanished since the host cannot be reached. But if the timing is just _bad_, the agent is back online while the jobs are being created, and it will process some of those commands. Playing with the `ping.timeout` value would only move the window of the bug in another direction.\n\nIt's not too easy to make it happen but feasible.\n\nThe problem could be handle differently, but I found this way a good solution without adding too much complexity in the HA worker tasks, like checking between investigation the state of the host. IMO if the VM are not HA, then nothing should be done: **the fencing should not be started** and let the powerState report change the VMs state when it could reach back the agent on the host. Currently the fencing is being done(and the restart is skipped since a check for HA is done before).\n\nWe are running a custom version based on 4.4.2 with many merges, but as I could see the bug still present on master, I pushed this PR.\n\nHope this helps you better understand the problem.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/240444323/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/240445333","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1615#issuecomment-240445333","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1615","id":240445333,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MDQ0NTMzMw==","user":{"login":"jburwell","id":285646,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTY0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/285646?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell","html_url":"https://github.com/jburwell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-17T15:17:16Z","updated_at":"2016-08-17T15:17:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@nvazquez could you please add Marvin test cases to verify the new API behavior?

This means that for a 20GB volume that is mostly empty, it will copy a full 20GB file onto secondary storage as a backup.  I have changed this to it always sets the source type to that of the disk (which should always be RAW for RBD), and sets the dest disk type to QCOW2.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/240552349/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/240560535","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1645#issuecomment-240560535","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1645","id":240560535,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MDU2MDUzNQ==","user":{"login":"nathanejohnson","id":1360240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjAyNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1360240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathanejohnson","html_url":"https://github.com/nathanejohnson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathanejohnson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathanejohnson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathanejohnson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathanejohnson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathanejohnson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathanejohnson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathanejohnson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathanejohnson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathanejohnson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-17T21:51:37Z","updated_at":"2016-08-17T21:51:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"```\nbefore:\n\n[njohnson@csm01.nsvltn secondary]$ ls -lh snapshots/102/5022/a6baaf14-190a-4a06-b95a-5b502fbd7d06\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 40G Aug 17 16:41 snapshots/102/5022/a6baaf14-190a-4a06-b95a-5b502fbd7d06\n[njohnson@csm01.nsvltn secondary]$ file snapshots/102/5022/a6baaf14-190a-4a06-b95a-5b502fbd7d06\nsnapshots/102/5022/a6baaf14-190a-4a06-b95a-5b502fbd7d06: x86 boot sector;

I try to do my best to look at the current code in CS to find possible fixes of any bug/problem we encounter or changes we want to do in our version. I want us to get back to the master version but that's not the topic here, neither going to happen in the next weeks.\n\nThe point 2 does not make sense to me. If the management server cannot determine the state of the VM, it could mark them as stopped (_even though I don't think it should_). But it should not create a StopVM job, because that might trigger a proper stop of the VM if the agent is reconnecting while the job is picked by async job workers.\nIf the VM is really down because the host has crashed, then the command is pointless, and in a customer point of view it would not make a difference. If the host is still up and fine, but we have a network glitch, then requesting a stop of the VM is really bad in a customer point of view. By not doing anything, not requesting a stop, we would end up in a better situation.\n\nGoing back to which state should be set on the VM when the management server cannot determine it, taking the assumption that the VM is stopped because the management server cannot reach the agent is as much incorrect as leaving it as it is (running, migrating, creating...). I'd rather create a new state `UNKNOWN` for such special case, when the management server does really not know. In a management point of view it will be also easier to know there are _ghost_ VMs somewhere for which the management server cannot determine the exact state and proper investigation (_manual_) should be done if the state stays like this, regarding the billing part too.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/240663081/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/240671941","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1634#issuecomment-240671941","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1634","id":240671941,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MDY3MTk0MQ==","user":{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-18T09:31:00Z","updated_at":"2016-08-18T09:31:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@karuturi @jburwell can we merge this, this is only packaging related fix.
