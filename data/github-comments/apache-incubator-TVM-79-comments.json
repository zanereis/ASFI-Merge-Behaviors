After the following discussion we all agree we can remove unnecessary concepts and ship a minimal definition of pass and the pass manager. \r\n\r\nThe pass interface will be Module -> Module with an optional PassContext object which will contain things such as the error reporter. User passes can ignore this if they want, but it will provide value to passes to tap into common functionality such as errors and diagnostics. \r\n\r\nWe will have a single pass base class that contains the metadata about passes and a pass method of type `Module run(Module&, PassContext*)`. We can build higher level notions on top of this, and the goal of the pass manager is to schedule and execute these passes. \r\n\r\nWe believe this satisfies the design criteria everyone has laid out above.

Thanks for the hard work on proposing and bringing in the implementation, this seems to be an RFC that many folks are interested in.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt on the possibility to make a correct and efficient tensor expression auto diff. The key issue we need to address first is how can we make a clear set of APIs and namespaces so that:\r\n- We have a clear separation between relay's grad and the current tensor expression one\r\n- Have a clear indication for frontend user to use relay's grad, while use tensor expression one for the operator impl\r\n- Have a consistent API so a user does not get confused when using one or another.\r\n- Because the primary support for end to end grad is in relay, we want to name the files clearly(e.g. tvm/autodiff-> tvm/expr_grad.h) to make that distinction, so it is more clear that relay is the entry point of tvm stack's differentiation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese discussions and decision are important because they will affect how users will use the API, as per https://docs.tvm.ai/contribute/code_review.html#deliberate-on-api-and-data-structures\r\n\r\nI suggest we discuss them, reach consensus before we move on \r\n\r\ncc @merrymercy @jroesch @yzhliu @junrushao1994 @ZihengJiang @grwlf @dmlc/tvm-committer ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/464356865/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/464356956","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2498#issuecomment-464356956","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2498","id":464356956,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NDM1Njk1Ng==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-16T15:43:31Z","updated_at":"2019-02-16T15:43:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Sorry for delayed comment, I posted some updated thoughts in the RFC.

(The actual tensor computation we are currently using this technique for is not matmul. I'm using matmul as an example only)\r\n\r\nThe reason we use the fine-grained version in our tensor computation is that it gives us more flexibility. Does that answer your question?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/464495157/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/464507013","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/2614#issuecomment-464507013","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2614","id":464507013,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NDUwNzAxMw==","user":{"login":"ehsanmok","id":6980212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5ODAyMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6980212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok","html_url":"https://github.com/ehsanmok","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-17T20:48:49Z","updated_at":"2019-02-17T20:48:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/464507013/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/464522430","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2613#issuecomment-464522430","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2613","id":464522430,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NDUyMjQzMA==","user":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-17T22:58:23Z","updated_at":"2019-02-20T17:32:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"(Outdated, don't read)\r\n\r\n@tqchen @were  Hey I updated the code accordingly.

I'd suggest something like `tensordiff`, `tensor_expr_diff`, `tensor_expr_ad`. I think using just `expr` without `tensor` may be a little bit confusing, since there are exprs in Relay too. Using `grad` vs `diff` is a matter of taste, I guess, `diff` seems more general though.\r\n* The main user-facing python function `tvm.autodiff.differentiate`, reexported as `tvm.differentiate` for convenience. I would suggest keeping its name as is, however we probably shouldn't reexport it, to avoid confusion.\r\n* Some more or less internal C++ functions and data structures (`Differentiate`, `Jacobian`, `DiffBuildingBlock`, [here](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/5ae4ac1c352de4e893997c8d316eb5822cc563f9/include/tvm/autodiff.h)).  They live under `tvm::ir::` in C++ and are exported into `tvm.autodiff` in python.  I would also suggest keeping their names, however we probably should create a separate namespace for them in C++, like `tvm::autodiff`.\r\n* The relay/autodiff integration file `src/relay/op/autodiff_integration.cc`. Its name will be changed when we rename `autodiff`. Not sure about the `_integration` part.\r\n* The relay/autodiff integration op `autogenerated_gradient`. Not sure, suggestions are welcome.\r\n* Functions `relay._ir_pass.AutogeneratePrimalGradient` and `relay._ir_pass.AutogeneratePrimalGradientForAll`. Not sure.\r\n\r\n## API\r\n\r\nThe main thing to discuss here is the python function `tvm.autodiff.differentiate`. Recently I decided that its gradient overriding mechanism is rather difficult to use, and tried to improve it.  Not sure if it's better now, however let's discuss the new version. Its signature and docstring may be found [here](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/5ae4ac1c352de4e893997c8d316eb5822cc563f9/python/tvm/autodiff.py#L54), Here is just short description:\r\n\r\n```python \r\ndef differentiate(output, inputs=None, head=None, override=None, fdiff=None): \r\n    \"\"\"Perform reverse-mode automatic differentiation.  \r\n```\r\n\r\nParameters:\r\n* `output : Tensor` - The tensor to differentiate.\r\n* `inputs : List[Tensor]` - The list of input tensors. When the list is empty or None, will perform differentiation wrt all tensors the output depends on.\r\n* `head : Tensor`, optional - The adjoint of the output. By default full Jacobians will be computed (or simply gradients in the case of a scalar output).\r\n* `override` - A dict describing how to override differentiation for certain tensors (see the link).\r\n* `fdiff` - The function performing differentiation and multiplication of single tensors, by default `tvm.autodiff.DiffBuildingBlock` is used.\r\n\r\nThe returned value of the function is an instance of [DifferentiationResult](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/5ae4ac1c352de4e893997c8d316eb5822cc563f9/python/tvm/autodiff.py#L8).  It mimics a list of gradients (corresponding to inputs) but also contains two other fields: `adjoints` and `adjoint_summands` to access intermediate adjoints.\r\n\r\nSeveral issues to discuss:\r\n* The name of the `head` parameter. May be it'd better be called `output_adjoint` or `output_gradient` or, more precisely, `gradient_wrt_output`, although I tend to avoid the word \"gradient\" since we don't require the final output to be scalar.\r\n* The gradient overriding mechanism is still quite obscure, maybe we should remove it from this function completely (the corresponding parameters may be retained in the C++ function `Differentiate`).\r\n* The `fdiff` parameter, however, is much easier to understand, so I suggest retaining it.\r\n* Probably we should support multiple outputs, since differentiating them one by one may be less efficient.\r\n\r\nAnother important function is the C++ counterpart, [tvm::ir::Differentiate](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/5ae4ac1c352de4e893997c8d316eb5822cc563f9/include/tvm/autodiff.h#L143) This function is for developers though. Currently my only suggestion is that we might want to support multiple outputs and heads.\r\n\r\n## Relay integration API\r\n\r\nThe user mostly needs two functions: ([code here](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/5ae4ac1c352de4e893997c8d316eb5822cc563f9/src/relay/op/autodiff_integration.cc#L189)):\r\n- `AutogeneratePrimalGradient(op_name, plevel)` - override FPrimalGradient for the given operation (with the given plevel, 100 by default)\r\n- `AutogeneratePrimalGradientForAll(plevel)` - override FPrimalGradient for every existing operation. The plevel here is 5 by default, so it shouldn't override gradients for operations with FPrimalGradient already defined.\r\n\r\nThe operation representing the generated gradients currently takes a single tuple as input and returns a single tuple as output ([here](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/5ae4ac1c352de4e893997c8d316eb5822cc563f9/src/relay/op/autodiff_integration.cc#L140)).  The attributes of the operation are as follows:\r\n* `original_op : Op` - The original operation.\r\n* `original_attrs : Attrs` - The attributes of the original operation.\r\n* `original_out_type : Type`, optional - The type of the original expression. \r\n\r\nHowever, I think this operation should be considered an implementation detail, and the stability of its attributes, inputs and outputs shouldn't be relied

appreciate your upcoming contributions in advance!\r\n\r\nGreat questions :)\r\n\r\n> what's the relationship between ...\r\n\r\n1.  Everything starts from [dlpack's `DLTensor`](https://github.com/dmlc/dlpack/blob/master/include/dlpack/dlpack.h#L111:L147) as a common tensor/ndarray format for DL frameworks (adopted by Apache MXNet and Pytorch).\r\n\r\n2. TVM uses the type alias [`TVMArray` for `DLTensor`](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/master/include/tvm/runtime/c_runtime_api.h#L120).\r\n\r\n3. [`TVMArrayHandle` is an opaque pointer to `TVMArray`](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/master/include/tvm/runtime/c_runtime_api.h#L123).\r\n\r\n4. In frontends (Rust/Python/Java) they define `NDArray` wrapper (struct/class) around `TVMArrayHandle` with more info such as `is_view`.\r\n\r\n5. Rust has the luxury of defining its own `ndarray/tensor` in runtime.\r\n\r\n6. There's Rust's crate [ndarray](https://github.com/rust-ndarray/ndarray) which we use here to interact with our own `Tensor/NDArray`. Similar to `numpy.ndarray` vs. `mxnet.NDArray`/`pytorch.Tensor`.\r\n\r\n7. `NDArrayContainer` is runtime managed NDArray and it's *not* supported in Rust frontend `Function` for now. See [#1418](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/pull/1418) for more info.\r\n\r\n> Also, do you intend to unify `Function` and `PackedFunc`? I'm still not certain if they do the same thing or not.\r\n\r\nRust frontend `Function` (like `NDArray`) contains a `TVMFunctionHandle` of  [C++ PackedFunc](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/master/include/tvm/runtime/packed_func.h#L53:L119). Rust frontend optimum representation of `C++ PackedFunc` is `fn(&[TVMArgValue]) -> Result<TVMRetValue>` (which you can use in `register_global_func!` macro to register Rust's packed function as a callback to C++ backend) because first [`fn is a (safe) primitive function pointer type constructor and is already Fn + Pointer + Send + Sync + ...`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.fn.html) and  second it captures the `Result`. Runtime representation is [`Box<Fn(&[TVMArgValue]) -> TVMRetValue + Send + Sync>`](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/master/rust/runtime/src/packed_func.rs#L15) as direct translation of `std::function<void (TVMArgs args, TVMRetValue* rv)>;`. It's in this PR TODO to change it so that function can capture `Result`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/464903604/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/464904769","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/1996#issuecomment-464904769","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1996","id":464904769,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NDkwNDc2OQ==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-18T22:27:10Z","updated_at":"2019-02-18T22:28:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"- We can use gradient or differentiation to indicate the gradient.

I still think we need more thoughts :) So far in the current design, there are two-level of pass structures with inconsistent interfaces:\r\n\r\n- Pass: which is the low-level transformation with meta-data, declares requirements.\r\n   - Exposes a (Module, PassContext -> Module) public interface\r\n- Optimizer: composes the passes, \r\n   - Mutates its internal module, hosts states.\r\n   - The name(optimizer) can confuse the user(due to the dual meaning of optimization)\r\n\r\nThe reason that I do not like the current design is that it forces everything to the optimize interface, while optimizer itself do is NOT a pass. A user has to learn two concepts: Pass and Optimize, more importantly, both of them are somewhat different from Module->Module.\r\n\r\nWe should learn lessons from deep learning systems(```torch.nn``` or ```gluon.Block```). Take gluon, for example, each Block is a ```Tensor->Tensor``` transformation. We can compose the Blocks by creating new blocks, importantly, after composing Block together, the result is still a Block, and a user can simply treat this as a ```Tensor->Tensor function```.\r\n\r\nSo I really want us to come up with a design, which corresponds to ```gluon.Block```, except for Pass. \r\n\r\nA user only has to learn one concept: Pass(coresponds to gluon.Block).  It has a few concepts:\r\n   -  A Module->Module call (operator() ) function\r\n   - Some meta-data about dependencies.\r\n   - Perhaps optional SetPassContext to setup context(there are pros and cons about pass PassContext as the argument of operator() vs as a setter)\r\n\r\nA PassManager itself is a Pass(analogy to nn.Sequential), which automatically resolves dependencies in its internal implementation. It again exposes a Module->Module interface, its meta-data dependency requirement is empty. \r\n\r\n- A pass manager itself can again be composed into another Pass Manager sequence of transformations(because it is a Pass).\r\n- A user can simply invoke the composed Pass as a Module->Module function.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/464972683/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/464984371","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/2448#issuecomment-464984371","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2448","id":464984371,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NDk4NDM3MQ==","user":{"login":"ZihengJiang","id":17693755,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NjkzNzU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17693755?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang","html_url":"https://github.com/ZihengJiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-19T05:04:55Z","updated_at":"2019-02-19T05:05:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"v0.5 has been tagged https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/releases/tag/v0.5","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/464984371/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/464985452","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2569#issuecomment-464985452","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2569","id":464985452,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NDk4NTQ1Mg==","user":{"login":"hlu1","id":14827759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODI3NzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14827759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlu1","html_url":"https://github.com/hlu1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlu1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlu1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlu1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlu1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlu1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlu1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlu1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlu1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlu1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-19T05:11:18Z","updated_at":"2019-02-19T05:11:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@icemelon9, sorry about the delay.

There are actually only three major jobs, namely pass creation, pass execution, and dependency resolution. Then we can create different granularity of passes and implement `CreatePass()` and `ResolveDependency()`. Now each pass itself could be view as a pass manager and it globs required passes to resolve the dependency. \r\n\r\nThe `Optimizer` could be actually replaced by a `SequentialPass` and it could be inherited from `Pass` as well. Its major role is to resolve dependencies among a sequence of passes and it also implements the `run` method but instead if runs a sequences of passes.\r\n\r\nI think now we have a consistent interface, i.e. everything inherits from `Pass`, and it performs Module -> Module optimization. Users are also only required to interact with the `Pass` class.\r\n\r\nSome design considerations:\r\n1. Do we use setters or pass `PassContext`. I don't have strong preference.\r\n2. Do we need `CreatePass` or just register it as we currently do? I think `CreatePass` is probably not needed because the creation of FunctionPass and SequentialPass should be different.\r\n3. Do we need to have the meta info in the `Pass`? It seems that `SequentialPass` and `FunctionPass` should have different info though.\r\n4. Should we open a new namespace for pass manager, say `_pass_manager`, or use the current `ir_pass` namespace?\r\n\r\n@tqchen Anything else I missed for discussion? Let's have a final and elegant conclusion on the topics soon so that we can move forward.\r\n\r\nAgain, any comments and suggestions are welcome and
