I think it is not worth to create a JMH benchmark that test the operator itself because it would be quite complex. \r\n\r\nI'm not aware of other tools, but each linked list node contains a reference to its value and a reference to the next node in the link. That means we need at least 8 bytes (assuming compressed pointers) for each node. In theory these nodes may be spread in the heap, although my experience tell me that they are almost always to be one after the other in the heap because we allocate them by the same thread with no allocations in the middle. Future GCs may move them, but sounds pretty unlikely.\r\n\r\nWhile LinkedList requires 8 bytes per element that will probably but not for sure be contiguous in memory,  Array list requires just 4 bytes per element that are going to be contiguous in memory for sure.

The idea below.\r\nMutable Index\r\n\r\n| docID              | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4  |\r\n|--------------------|---|---|---|---|----|\r\n| flattenDocIDLength | 3 | 5 | 7 | 2 | 10 |\r\n\r\nLet say the sortedDocID list in immutable index is [2, 3, 4, 1, 0].\r\n\r\n| docID              | 2 | 3 | 4  | 1 | 0 |\r\n|--------------------|---|---|----|---|---|\r\n| flattenDocIDLength | 7 | 2 | 10 | 5 | 3 |\r\n\r\nlet say we can compute the array sortPos to reflect the index position in the sortedDocID.

(assume the docid offset is 0 in the segment for easier explain)\r\n\r\nThe flattenDocID start offset of the originalDocID would be changed from prefixSumOfMutableDocID[originalDocID] to prefixSumOfSortedDocID[sortPos[originalDocID]].\r\n\r\nTake the docID 3 for example, it's flatten ids falls in [3+5+7, 3+5+7+2) the mutable index. Would be shifted to [7, 7+2). \r\n\r\nGiven a flatten doc id of the mutable segment, we can use binary search over the prefixSumOfMutableDocID to induct the docID position in MutableSegment and then compute the flattenDocID in the immutable segment.\r\n\r\nIn short, the commit() method need to store the inverted index and the flattenDocIDLength into disk.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2041665938/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2041706893","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/12807#issuecomment-2041706893","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/12807","id":2041706893,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c55sfmN","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-08T01:28:16Z","updated_at":"2024-04-08T02:05:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## [Codecov](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/12807?dropdown=coverage&src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=apache) Report\nAll modified and coverable lines are covered by tests :white_check_mark:\n> Project coverage is 61.98%.

But here is the headline version: let say there are 8 workers. The segments are distributed across 8 workers. Each worker has a local hash table which use linear probing to resolve hash collision. Each worker is in charge of storing aggregated result for one partition. If a worker find out the aggregated key doesn't belong to the local partition, the worker would insert the aggregated row to other worker's hash table. If any one local hash table doesn't trigger the disk spilled condition, then there's no need to merge partition. However, if any of table trigger the disk spilled condition, then each worker would not distribute the aggregated row anymore. Each worker just do pre-aggregation internally. In the combination phase, the result would be merged on the fly, combining the result of each hash table's in-memory and on-disk result.\r\n\r\nThe DuckDB's has similar idea even though there are nuances: https://duckdb.org/2024/03/29/external-aggregation.html Each thread do pre-aggregation without distributing result at all. Instead each worker will partition locally and then another set of threads will merge result per partition in the 2nd approach. They also user linear probing with salt. linear probing is more disk friendly. To support resize efficiently, they implement a two-part aggregate hash table https://duckdb.org/2022/03/07/aggregate-hashtable\r\n\r\nThe Pinot groupBy currently doesn't support external aggregation and all threads write into a in-memory single concurrent hash map, which uses chaining. \r\n\r\nThe bustub implements a disk based hash table and use latch crabbing to increase concurrency. https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2024/project2/\r\n\r\n@chenboat For your question, I would say achieve low-memory usage purpose for groupby. To be general, each operator can support disk based mode, e.g., external sorting.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2041746962/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2041750481","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/12080#issuecomment-2041750481","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/12080","id":2041750481,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c55sqPR","user":{"login":"wirybeaver","id":19251177,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjUxMTc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19251177?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wirybeaver","html_url":"https://github.com/wirybeaver","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wirybeaver/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wirybeaver/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wirybeaver/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wirybeaver/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wirybeaver/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wirybeaver/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wirybeaver/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wirybeaver/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wirybeaver/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-08T02:23:31Z","updated_at":"2024-05-03T02:09:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Personally, I prefer DuckDB's approach which avoids concurrency at all.
