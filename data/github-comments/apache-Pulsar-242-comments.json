reason is same as [issues-7652](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/7652) : \r\n\r\n1.  [PulsarMetadata.getColumns()](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pulsar-sql/presto-pulsar/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/sql/presto/PulsarMetadata.java#L468) , nested field is dissociate with presto ParameterizedType in  TypeManager . nested field should be Row type in presto (reference `Hive struct type support`  https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+Types#LanguageManualTypes-ComplexTypes)\r\n2.  SchemaHandler is hard to work with [RecordCursor.getObject()](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pulsar-sql/presto-pulsar/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/sql/presto/PulsarRecordCursor.java#L557) to support `ROW`,`MAP`,`ARRAY` .etc\r\n\r\nso , I haved do some reconstruct  in my  Local Branch ,the main  change is\r\n\r\n- `PulsarMetadata` sociated with presto TypeManager \r\n-  Deprecate `SchemaHandler` , migrate to `presto-record-decoder` with a bit of extension \r\n- decoupled `pulsar-presto main module ` ( RecordSet,ConnectorMetadata .etc )  with `org.apache.avro.Schema`-> coupled with `org.apache.pulsar.common.schema.SchemaInfo `, aim to friendly with other schema type ( `PB` 、`thrift` etc..)\r\n\r\nI accomplished this code and test on my local environment ，@sijie @jerrypeng Is

@gaoran10 We created a clone of the whole production environment with the offloaded buckets too and, even with 2.6.1, we're perfectly able to replicate. In fact the consumers are still getting stuck. We're able to unlock them only by manually killing the pod on Kubernetes.\r\n\r\nI deployed 3 consumers with a key shared subscription listening to our `SpaceEvents` topic. Once all three are running I reset the consumers offset for that subscription to by doing `bin/pulsar-admin topics reset-cursor SpaceEvents -s cloud-pulsar-tester -t 99999w`. After the reset I can see that the 3 consumers started reading messages. The `msgRateOut` showed in the `bin/pulsar-admin topics stats SpaceEvents` also shows that all 3 are reading messages.\r\n\r\nAt some point, when there are around 181k messages left in the backlog,

The reason is same as [issues-7652](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/7652) :\r\n> \r\n> 1. [PulsarMetadata.getColumns()](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pulsar-sql/presto-pulsar/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/sql/presto/PulsarMetadata.java#L468) , nested field is dissociate with presto ParameterizedType in  TypeManager . nested field should be Row type in presto (reference `Hive struct type support`  https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+Types#LanguageManualTypes-ComplexTypes)\r\n> 2. SchemaHandler is hard to work with [RecordCursor.getObject()](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pulsar-sql/presto-pulsar/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/sql/presto/PulsarRecordCursor.java#L557) to support `ROW`,`MAP`,`ARRAY` .etc\r\n> \r\n> so , I haved do some reconstruct in my Local Branch ,the main change is\r\n> \r\n> * `PulsarMetadata` sociated with presto TypeManager\r\n> * Deprecate `SchemaHandler` , migrate to `presto-record-decoder` with a bit of extension\r\n> * decoupled `pulsar-presto main module ` ( RecordSet,ConnectorMetadata .etc )  with `org.apache.avro.Schema`-> coupled with `org.apache.pulsar.common.schema.SchemaInfo `, aim to friendly with other schema type ( `PB` 、`thrift` etc..)\r\n> \r\n> I accomplished this code and test on my local environment ，@sijie @jerrypeng Is

Please correct me if my explanation is wrong. \r\n@Lanayx Partitioned topic is implemented as N internal topics, so non-partitioned topic map to single internal topic and partitioned topic map to X of internal topic depends on number of partitions. \r\nAnd for partitioned topic with failover subscription active consumer will be pick for each partition(internal topic),  if more than one consumer connect the sorting is important to make sure assignment happens evenly across highest priority consumers, while for non-partitioned topic there'll be single active consumer so all the sorting is not very necessary. And due to the potential flaky network issue described above, sorting can be actually bad for non-partitioned topic.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/682758151/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/682873582","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/6231#issuecomment-682873582","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/6231","id":682873582,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4Mjg3MzU4Mg==","user":{"login":"devinbost","id":7418031,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MTgwMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7418031?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost","html_url":"https://github.com/devinbost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-28T16:48:18Z","updated_at":"2020-08-28T16:48:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I never actually figured out what was causing this...
