this is a huge change. I didn't look at all the details, just at the big picture, and that looks good to me. Let me just ask a few questions, sorry, I should probably have answered those by myself by looking at the code:\n\nWe have these type classes, numerics, strings, datetime, interval. Where does boolean fit in here, is it treated as an exact numeric in internal methods? If so, some code has subclasses of numbers with binary and decimal precision, would this be another case that allows only two values? I'm partially thinking of UDFs, and how we should treat boolean values there.\n\nAs far as i can tell, this follows the ANSI definition of a boolean data type, is this true or are there differences?\n\nIs this just experimental for now or should we add this type to the SQL Reference Manual?\n\nThanks, there are only a few people who can pull off a big change like this :-)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/231815832/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/231821702","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/585#issuecomment-231821702","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/585","id":231821702,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMTgyMTcwMg==","user":{"login":"zellerh","id":7062636,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNjI2MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7062636?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh","html_url":"https://github.com/zellerh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-11T18:26:42Z","updated_at":"2016-07-11T18:27:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@traflm, I think Steve wanted the test to check whether the additional tables are there or not.

to Hans/Dave's comment regarding boolean datatype.\n\nBoolean datatype is not a numeric datatype.\nIt cannot be used to compare or in arith opers with other numbers.\nIt is an additional datatype class to NUMERIC, CHARACTER, DATETIME, INTERVAL, BLOB.\nInternally it is stored as a one byte value with 0 for false and 1 for true.\n\nThere is still some support for boolean needed in drivers and SPJ/UDF. \nOnce that is done, we can document it in manuals. \n\nWe could also enhance it later so relational and boolean datatype operations can be mixed.\nEx:  update t set a = (b > 10)  \n   or use boolean datatype in a predicate of the form:  where a AND (b >  10);\n(one can still use it as:  where (a = true) AND (b > 10)
