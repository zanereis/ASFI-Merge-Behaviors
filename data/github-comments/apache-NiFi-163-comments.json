I made a lot of tests and it's working as I'd expect this to be. A few suggestions:\r\n> \r\n> * PutGCS, DeleteGCS - if the bucket does not exist, no error, could be something to check?\r\n> * PublishGCPubSub, PublishGCPubSubLite - we don't check if the topic exist, not sure if easy to check\r\n> * ConsumeGCPubSub, ConsumeGCPubSubLite - we don't check if the subscription exist, not sure if easy to check\r\n> * PutBigQueryBatch, PutBigQueryStreaming - we don't check if the dataset / table name exist, not sure if easy to check\r\n> \r\n> Not sure if the above can be added and can definitely be follow-up JIRAs. Thoughts? (regardless of the above, I'm a +1 and I can merge, let me know)\r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback, @pvillard31 !  I had considered these cases originally, but could not find a way to exercise these methods without making the actual calls.  However, upon further review I now see an API method named `testIamPermissions` that looks promising.  I'll check this out and add some more verification if possible.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/990909849/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/991006312","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5563#issuecomment-991006312","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5563","id":991006312,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM47EY5o","user":{"login":"bbende","id":605416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTQxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende","html_url":"https://github.com/bbende","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-10T14:12:20Z","updated_at":"2021-12-10T14:12:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Seems like we have reached consensus here with several approvals, going to merge this, thanks @mattyb149 !!!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/991006312/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/991195276","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4646#issuecomment-991195276","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4646","id":991195276,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM47FHCM","user":{"login":"adamfisher","id":1834711,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzQ3MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1834711?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamfisher","html_url":"https://github.com/adamfisher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamfisher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamfisher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamfisher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamfisher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamfisher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamfisher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamfisher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamfisher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamfisher/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-10T18:23:46Z","updated_at":"2021-12-10T18:23:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"If there is something I can do to get this across the finish line I would love to help.
