you for detail explanation. I've reviewed current Mesos runtime implementation more to do that. But, according to the initial documents, I still think this comments means how to get parameters for the existing Mesos Cluster slaves if they are configured not to use 5051.\n\n```\n-  private static final int MESOS_SLAVE_PORT = 5051;\n-  //  Assumes for now that all slaves use port 5051(default) TODO: make it configurable.\n```\n\nWe are launching `MesosRemoteManager`, `REEFScheduler`, `REEFExecutor`, but not `mesos-slave` daemon (whose default port is 5051). \n\nIf you are considering `MesosRemoteManager`, I found that `RangeTcpPortProvider` is already applied during Injection. Do you suggest to configure this `portRangeBegin`, `portRangeCount`, and `portRangeTryCount` for `MesosRemoteManager`? If then, I can create another issue for that.\n\n```\nthis.raw = remoteManagerFactory.getInstance(\"MESOS_EXECUTOR\", codec, mesosErrorHandler);\n```\n\n```\n17:18:40,652 FINE ...

MESOS_SLAVE_PORT\n   - Mesos slave is a long running process which serves a similar purpose as NodeManager in YARN. MESOS_SLAVE_PORT represents the port number of Mesos slaves and used for building a node descriptor. This node descriptor is stored in `ResourceCatalog`, an interface I believe REEF users query against to obtain available node/rack information.\n   - Then why the constant number 5051? Unlike YARN API, which provides the port numbers of NodeManagers, Mesos API does not provide the port numbers of Mesos slaves. Thus, I settled with 5051(the default) assuming it as the common case. Note that making the number configurable doesn't completely solve the problem, as Mesos slaves can be configured to use different ports.\n   - My questions: what's the use of exposing to REEF users Mesos Slave/NodeManager hostname/port information through `ResourceCatalog`? Also the comments in `NodeDescriptor` says as if the class describes an Evaluator's inet address, isn't this wrong? Am I missing something here?\n2. MesosRemoteManager\n   - This is a little hack I did to work around some problems I had in making REEF semantics work with Mesos API. I see that it is using a deprecated constructor. I'm currently looking into how to do without this. \n   - Meanwhile, as it does work, I think we can leave it as is for now.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/156291101/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/156307758","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/626#issuecomment-156307758","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/626","id":156307758,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NjMwNzc1OA==","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-13T02:54:00Z","updated_at":"2015-11-13T02:54:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thankn you very much, @johnyangk .\n\nThen, as a author of the following comment, why do you leave the following TODO comments?

All public facing APIs are already documented. Let me know if there are sections of the code that isn't intuitive, since most of these calls are just wrappers for the Azure Storage Blob Client. For now, the `AzureBlobFileSystem` isn't particularly efficient because it makes calls such as `GetBlobReferenceFromServer()`.\nSee http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18053679/what-is-the-difference-between-getblobreference-and-getblobreferencefromserver for why it's not efficient.\nI believe, however, there is no `GetBlobFromReference()` method in the Azure Blob Storage API, but instead there are methods such as `GetBlockBlobReference()` and `GetPageBlobReference()`. This, although more efficient than `GetBlobReferenceFromServer()`, will limit us to a single type of blob we can support, so I ultimately chose to use `GetBlobReferenceFromServer()` instead. Do you think we should only support a single type of blob? Or should we be more general.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/156656152/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/156656333","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/641#issuecomment-156656333","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/641","id":156656333,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NjY1NjMzMw==","user":{"login":"afchung","id":2817619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTc2MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2817619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung","html_url":"https://github.com/afchung","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-14T06:53:56Z","updated_at":"2015-11-14T06:55:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@markusweimer
