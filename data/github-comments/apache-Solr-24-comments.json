I close this PR and start to work on a solrj-streaming PR lets be sure we don't want this to be a server module.\r\n\r\nThe original streaming classes were designed to be a Java API using the decorator pattern to layer on new behaviors. This fit pretty well with the Solrj library which is Java based. So it was placed there.\r\n\r\nWhen streaming expressions came around it became easy to support complex expressions that simply are not practical with the Java API. The /stream handler became the focal point which moved things towards a server side model. At this point I consider Streaming Expressions a server side tool.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is that we make it a server side module and we can add Solrj support for sending a Streaming Expression to the stream handler.\r\n\r\nThe only reason I see to keep it a client side tool is to support existing clients that are using the Java API. Which may be reason enough.\r\n\r\nOne compromise would be to leave a small subset of TupleStream implementations in Solrj. Then move all the rest of the classes to a server side module.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1285456616/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1285467317","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1094#issuecomment-1285467317","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1094","id":1285467317,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5Mnqy1","user":{"login":"janhoy","id":409128,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTEyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/409128?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy","html_url":"https://github.com/janhoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-20T12:33:47Z","updated_at":"2022-10-20T12:33:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I have used streaming in just a limited amount client-side.

It's fine to update these at any time because there are no actual releases for these branches, just nightly builds of the ref-guide.\r\n\r\nHowever for the release branches (`branch_9_0`, `branch_9_1`), we only want to update the `antora.yaml` on release, because they represent the official ref guide for the latest release of that minor version. So let's say that Solr 9.2.0 uses Lucene 9.5.0, there is a bug discovered in Lucene 9.5.0 so 9.5.1 is released. If we then go update `branch_9_2` to use Lucene 9.5.1, we do not want the official ref guide to say that Solr `9.2.0` is using Lucene `9.5.1`.\r\n\r\nSo while for the vast majority of the time this check is good, it's not 100% of the time. So we probably shouldn't bake it into the precommit command.\r\n\r\nOn a side note, there is a task `gradle setOfficialAntoraYaml` that will re-generate this file with all correct changes. (This is used as a part of the releaseWizard process).  I will add some text to the top of the antora.yaml that spells this out better.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1285712667/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1285735665","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1014#issuecomment-1285735665","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1014","id":1285735665,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5MosTx","user":{"login":"HoustonPutman","id":3376422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzY0MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3376422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman","html_url":"https://github.com/HoustonPutman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-20T15:22:26Z","updated_at":"2022-10-20T15:22:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Just a quick comment: Does the move to Overseer render SolrZkClient obsolete @HoustonPutman ?
