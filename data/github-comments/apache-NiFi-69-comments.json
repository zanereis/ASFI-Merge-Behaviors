LGTM, ran full build with unit tests and contrib-check (will remove some dead code while merging), and tested with regular and operator-enabled documents. A couple parting comments:\r\n\r\n1) Are you interested in adding this functionality to PutMongoRecord as well? If so please feel free to write a Jira and/or implement it :)\r\n2) Now that it supports operators, should we consider allowing an update query rather than just a key?\r\n\r\nIn any case, this is great, thanks for the improvement!

I must say, I very much enjoy your coding style. During the review, though, I did notice a few things. \r\n\r\n- The `^` characters for the version numbers in the package.json should be removed. \r\n- The fa-align-left icon on the 'Format' editor button does not appear to be centered. It seems to be 1px too high. \r\n- When a user hovers over the 'Save' button that the 'Changes saved successfully' text seems to shift a few pixels.\r\n- Documentation/code comments. Please add JS doc to all methods.\r\n\r\nI would also like to see if @moranr or @mattyb149 have any other suggestions for the styling of the components in this UI (for consistency with nifi) or any other functionality we may want to add with this UI/UX.\r\n\r\nI have a few other concerns with this advanced UI that I think we should discuss here. At first @yuri1969 , I was wondering why you chose to use Angular 1.x. These advanced UI's are web applications in and of themselves so you could have chosen any front end libraries you like. Then I realized that you probably chose to use Angular v1.5.x because that is what Nifi (and the Jolt advance UI) use and those libraries are already available in the nifi-web-ui. While I agree that this is a practical approach (and follows what has already been implemented previously in Nifi) I question whether this is a good long term solution. We need a high quality and enforceable way to provide Nifi UI developers with a set of reusable UI/UX components that can be leveraged in nifi, any advanced nifi processor UI's, and the new nifi registry so that we can deliver a consistent UX to our users across all our various 'web apps'.\r\n\r\nThere is a Jira out there (somewhere, although I cant find it right now) to upgrade Angular to the latest and greatest and to move away from Angular 1.x.  There is also a lot of work being done right now for the upcoming nifi registry release that will provide an NgModule called \"Fluid Design System\" that is meant to be this \"high quality reusable UI/UX component\" module that will help to provide a consistent UX. @mcgilman  I would like your take on this as well....I my mind I would really like to see this advanced UI be developed as an Angular 4.x application and leverage the new FDS module.\r\n\r\nAnother concern I have is the lack of unit tests. This is not a knock against @yuri1969 but rather a general statement on the state of the nifi UI code base (and again @mcgilman I would like your input on this as I know I am guilty of not providing unit tests for new nifi UI features as well). I feel strongly that if we are going to introduce an entirely new web application (as we are doing with the nifi registry and here with this advanced UI) that we should hold it to the same quality standards we expect with any Java code (including code formatting, code documentation, unit tests, and integration tests). @yuri1969 whether or not we decide to use angular 1.x or 4.x It should be fairly straight forward to include a karma.conf.js file and to leverage the frontend-maven-plugin in the pom to run karma/jasmine tests for this advanced UI.\r\n\r\n@yuri1969 what do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/344272308/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/344334113","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2269#issuecomment-344334113","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2269","id":344334113,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NDMzNDExMw==","user":{"login":"scottyaslan","id":6797571,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3OTc1NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6797571?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottyaslan","html_url":"https://github.com/scottyaslan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottyaslan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottyaslan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottyaslan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottyaslan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottyaslan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottyaslan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottyaslan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottyaslan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottyaslan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-14T17:27:24Z","updated_at":"2017-11-14T17:27:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I just had another thought...do we think that it is a worthwhile effort to minify and compress the JS/CSS/HTML?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/344334113/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/344335401","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2269#issuecomment-344335401","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2269","id":344335401,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NDMzNTQwMQ==","user":{"login":"yuri1969","id":13468636,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDY4NjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13468636?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuri1969","html_url":"https://github.com/yuri1969","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuri1969/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuri1969/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuri1969/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuri1969/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuri1969/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuri1969/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuri1969/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuri1969/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuri1969/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-14T17:31:34Z","updated_at":"2017-11-14T17:31:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@scottyaslan Thank you for the kind words.

I just wanted to get the discussion moving forward about how we can offer a consistent quality UX across the nifi suite of web apps.\r\n\r\nFor the JS unit tests you should be able to use the nifi registry as an example. It uses npm and the frontend-maven-plugin to run the karma.conf.js (https://github.com/apache/nifi-registry/blob/master/nifi-registry-web-ui/pom.xml#L442 and also https://github.com/apache/nifi-registry/blob/master/nifi-registry-web-ui/src/main/frontend/package.json#L7).\r\n\r\nAs for optimizing/minifying/bundling the JS/CSS/HTML there are a few different ways you could go about it. The nifi web site and the nifi registry both use grunt so there are some options there. The nifi registry uses grunt along with SystemJS to bundle and minify the client code (https://github.com/apache/nifi-registry/blob/master/nifi-registry-web-ui/pom.xml#L344). Nifi itself, however, uses maven and the YUI compressor to produce a client bundle (https://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/master/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-framework-bundle/nifi-framework/nifi-web/nifi-web-ui/pom.xml#L418).

That is mainly because writes in Druid can only happen after a configured quantity of data (Segment Granularity Spec) has been indexed and organized into a storage segment (schema, bitmap index, aggregate metrics, compression). Only an Indexing job can create a segment (either batch or realtime). Realtime indexing jobs can be created in one of two ways. 1.) Pull via a Firehose (Druid Aware Pull API) created to read the stream source, controlled by a Druid Realtime Node (like the Kafka Indexing Service). 2.) Push via Tranquility (Druid Indexing API) from stream source to Druid Overlord and then MiddleManager Nodes that will make the data immediately queryable while indexing it for storage as a segment.
