Sorry to leave this hanging for so long.\r\n\r\nThere is a bug in Spark (that has been patched but I don't think it's been released) where queries without any unresolved fields (such as named columns in the query) don't properly parse. There's also a bug where MERGE INTO queries are resolved by ordinal position (and not by field name) in Spark, which has also been patched but I don't believe we'll see those patches upstream until Spark 3.2. Though I don't think either of those are what you're hitting.\r\n\r\nIs this just a concern about predicate pushdown? I do seem to recall that (at least in older versions), predicates aren't always pushed down if the type is different (I think especially coming from subqueries). I'd have to look into it again.\r\n\r\nI'll see if I can recall (or find somebody who knows more than I do) about the conditions in which predicate pushdown does or does not occur.\r\n\r\nIf you can upgrade to Spark 3.1, that would be ideal. Now that we support Spark 3.1, I will admit that I am always a bit suspicious of a lot of behavior with Spark 3.0.x (though I cannot confirm that that's the issue here).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/907499637/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/907503979","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3030#issuecomment-907503979","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3030","id":907503979,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX842F2lr","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-27T22:15:37Z","updated_at":"2021-08-27T22:15:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes, reopening a PR will retrigger tests.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/907503979/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/907515416","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3008#issuecomment-907515416","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3008","id":907515416,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX842F5YY","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-27T22:56:29Z","updated_at":"2021-08-27T22:56:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merging now.

I had to add the minimal hadoop dependency and in the code I had to initialize the hadoop conf with the constructor which has a boolean false, telling that to not load any hadoop config file (since I don't have in Flink). Finally, I managed to work with the streaming job, which is running in Flink 1.13.1 (behind Ververica CE).\r\nDefinitively, I see a good reason to remove the hadoop conf dependency from GlueCatalog, which uses the custom catalog from iceberg code.\r\n\r\nCurrently there are three catalog implementation classes and somehow GlueCatalog falls under the custom catalog implementation. From design aspects, the constellation of these three type of catalogs and how another specialized like GlueCatalog is used, may cause some confusion at first time when you try to use. Some refactoring, such as removal of hadoop conf or more, it would be nice to

If the only reason to have the GlueCatalog implement Configurable is to satisfy the current constraints of dynamic FileIO loading, likely we can change that (I believe dynamic FileIO loading was added

Additional updates to the FlinkCatalogFactory are still needed on top of these changes in order to fully remove the hadoop dependency.  One possible solution is to add `glue` as one of the known `catalog-type`'s and avoid calling `clusterHadoopConf()` when the user sets this value (I tested this change with a local build and it worked in a non-hadoop environment).\r\n2. While this addresses the issue for the GlueCatalog, it will not fix this issue for other catalog implementations which also should be able to work outside of a hadoop environment (e.g. DynamoCatalog).\r\n\r\nI am not completely sure how best to address concern 2.  When I look at both the GlueCatalog and DynamoCatalog, it seems the only reason for the `Configurable` interface is for supporting dynamic loading of FileIO implementations which may or may not need to inspect hadoop conf (currently only `HadoopFileIO`).   `HadoopCatalog` and `HiveCatalog` both look for additional configuration settings in the hadoop conf (beyond just for `HadoopFileIO`).\r\n\r\nPerhaps it makes sense to decouple these two dependencies such that a FileIO implementation can be provided to any catalog independent of that catalog's interaction with hadoop (or lack thereof).  I think this would also simplify the story for the `GlueCatalog` without having to have two distinct classes.  (There is a potential strange place a user could get into trying to use the base `GlueCatalog` for the `catalog-impl` and `HadoopFileIO` for the `io-impl`).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/908026571/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/908042284","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/3044#issuecomment-908042284","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3044","id":908042284,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX842H6As","user":{"login":"kainoa21","id":4909735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MDk3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4909735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kainoa21","html_url":"https://github.com/kainoa21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kainoa21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kainoa21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kainoa21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kainoa21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kainoa21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kainoa21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kainoa21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kainoa21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kainoa21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-30T05:32:37Z","updated_at":"2021-08-30T05:32:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I believe that one potential root issue is that `FileIO` has leaked out from `TableOperations` into catalog implementations like `GlueCatalog`.  Theoretically, provided a catalog extending `BaseMetastoreCatalog` can implement `newTableOps` then all the `FileIO` configuration should happen inside TableOperations.  \r\n\r\nIt makes more sense that `GlueTableOperations` might have multiple implementations (one that explicitly handles `HadoopFileIO`).  Even then, in an ideal case the only class that would explicitly need to handle hadoop conf would be `HadoopFileIO`.  This would require a more complex `Catalog` initialization implementation (probably some sort of builder pattern) where all of the requisite pieces could be instantiated and configured independently.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/908042284/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/908311617","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3034#issuecomment-908311617","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3034","id":908311617,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX842I7xB","user":{"login":"hehuiyuan","id":18002496,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDAyNDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18002496?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hehuiyuan","html_url":"https://github.com/hehuiyuan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hehuiyuan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hehuiyuan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hehuiyuan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hehuiyuan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hehuiyuan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hehuiyuan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hehuiyuan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hehuiyuan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hehuiyuan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-30T12:44:57Z","updated_at":"2021-09-18T02:43:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi  @kbendick , is that what you mean?\r\nTake a look when you have time.?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/908311617/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/908354618","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3013#issuecomment-908354618","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3013","id":908354618,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX842JGQ6","user":{"login":"ggershinsky","id":12033212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDMzMjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12033212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggershinsky","html_url":"https://github.com/ggershinsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggershinsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggershinsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggershinsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggershinsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggershinsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggershinsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggershinsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggershinsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggershinsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-30T13:43:25Z","updated_at":"2021-08-30T13:43:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Back from the vacation.

Thank you @stevenzwu for the info.\r\n\r\nWe are hoping to reduce the tight coupling of Hadoop `Configuration` from the catalogs, as some folks have pointed out that it's difficult (or not presently possible as far as they know) to use things like `GlueCatalog` which don't actually require Hadoop in environments that are difficult to configure (specifically when using `AWS Kinesis Data Analytics`).\r\n\r\nFurther information can be found in this issue: https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/3044\r\n\r\nSpecifically, S3FileIO doesn't actually make use of anything from the `Configurable` interface, so there is an effort to try to make it so that `GlueCatalog` (and also `DynamoDbCatalog`) can be used in environments where Hadoop is not present and that is difficult to configure for them. This will greatly help with that goal. Eventually, it might wind up being beneficial to use the class loader that's provided by the new `Context` interface of Flink 1.13's `CatalogFactory`.\r\n\r\nI'll leave the rest of the discussion over in that issue (and possibly bring it up in that PR, though it's something that can be done in a follow up PR once this open one has been merged in).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/908590215/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/908590765","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/3050#issuecomment-908590765","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3050","id":908590765,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX842J_6t","user":{"login":"kbendick","id":9833362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MzMzNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9833362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick","html_url":"https://github.com/kbendick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-30T18:40:58Z","updated_at":"2021-08-30T18:40:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I will close this as a duplicate of https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/2558","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/908590765/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/908597980","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/2558#issuecomment-908597980","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2558","id":908597980,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX842KBrc","user":{"login":"kbendick","id":9833362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MzMzNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9833362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick","html_url":"https://github.com/kbendick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-30T18:51:18Z","updated_at":"2021-08-30T18:51:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for working on this. I wanted to draw attention to the issue mentioned above (Update FlinkCatalogFactory to implement the new Factory interface). I closed it as basically a duplicate of this one though.\r\n\r\nThe reason I opened that issue is that several users have reported difficulties in using Iceberg with Flink, specifically in configuring Hadoop.\r\n\r\nIn some environments, users might not have access to setup the class path properly for including Hadoop. The new [Context interface that provides access to the ClassLoader ](https://github.com/apache/flink/commit/4497e96b96724aee6637f19f64ffc8ba47a9b0ac#diff-d4dda8460ab068327897de5487517f43186faced18d3a121981e70f6ad9f827aR85) might help with that.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate goal is to decouple the need for hadoop to be in the environment when it's not actually needed (for example, when using `S3FileIO`). The thought was that upgrading to 1.13 (and the new FlinkCatalogFactory interface) will be helpful to provide the easier access to the ClassLoader.\r\n\r\nIn environments where hadoop `Configuration` isn't used, such as Ververica Platform or AWS Kinesis Data Analytics with `S3FileIO`, the hope is to remove the need for the Hadoop `Configuration` entirely.\r\n\r\nFor Ververica, users have reported a workaround but in Kinesis Data Analytics, it's a bit more difficult (as far as has been reported).\r\n\r\nMore information on the Hadoop `Configurable` concern can be found in this issue: https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/3044\r\n\r\nThanks again @zhangjun0x01!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/908597980/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/908609408","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/2934#issuecomment-908609408","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2934","id":908609408,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX842KEeA","user":{"login":"cccs-br","id":56260250,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjYwMjUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56260250?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cccs-br","html_url":"https://github.com/cccs-br","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cccs-br/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cccs-br/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cccs-br/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cccs-br/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cccs-br/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cccs-br/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cccs-br/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cccs-br/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cccs-br/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-30T19:06:52Z","updated_at":"2021-08-30T19:06:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi everyone, ...was just wondering if there are any updates on this?

I left some comments there, but my larger concern is not being able to access additional catalog options.  I've left some comments on that PR: https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2629\r\n\r\n> One possible solution is to add glue as one of the known catalog-type's and avoid calling clusterHadoopConf() when the user sets this value (I tested this change with a local build and it worked in a non-hadoop environment).\r\n\r\nAt present, I think adding to the known `catalog-type`s might be the best path forward to resolve the issue more immediately. I asked on the upgrade to Flink 1.13 PR, but it's possible that generically allowing `*` as an additional catalog option might not be possible. In which case, we'll definitely need to add `glue` etc (or at least all of their possible options).\r\n\r\n> I believe that one potential root issue is that FileIO has leaked out from TableOperations into catalog implementations like GlueCatalog. Theoretically, provided a catalog extending BaseMetastoreCatalog can implement newTableOps then all the FileIO configuration should happen inside TableOperations.\r\n\r\nIn the longer term, if these larger API changes to the interactions between `FileIO` and `TableOperations` and `Catalog` are undertaken / considered, we can remove the added `catalog-type`s if need be. But this is possibly a larger API change that will probably need to be considered a bit more closely.\r\n\r\nIn the near-term, I think it's most realistic to add the catalogs we support here in the repo to `catalog-type` to address the immediate issue. They can be removed later on if they're not needed / if the API changes. Plus, the additional configs (even for S3FileIO / AWS Authentication) might need to be added as predeclared to the `FlinkCatalogFactoryOptions` class as part of the 1.13 upgrade.\r\n\r\nIf somebody can provide a workaround for KDA, then the issue wouldn't necessarily be as pressing.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/908635309/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/908682253","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2945#issuecomment-908682253","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2945","id":908682253,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX842KWQN","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-30T20:46:42Z","updated_at":"2021-08-30T20:46:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@openinx,

At present, I think adding to the known catalog-types might be the best path forward to resolve the issue more immediately. \r\n\r\nThat is actually something we did not want to do and that's why the aws module is not a part of the flink module dependency. Adding that dependency is likely good for AWS, but as more catalog implementations are added, it becomes not manageable to have that many dependencies.\r\n\r\n>  believe that one potential root issue is that FileIO has leaked out from TableOperations into catalog implementations like GlueCatalog. \r\n\r\nThis was also discussed when implementing the catalog. Having FileIO default definition at catalog level is a feature, that's why `CatalogProperties.FILE_IO_IMPL` was created. Initializing the default FileIO in catalog allows reusing the same FileIO singleton instead of creating many different ones. \r\n\r\nI don't think the problem is solved even if you hide the `FileIO` creation in `TableOprations`, because `FileIO` also checks for the `Configurable` interface, it does not make much difference.\r\n\r\n> Additional updates to the FlinkCatalogFactory are still needed on top of these changes in order to fully remove the hadoop dependency\r\n\r\nYes you are right, we can fully remove the dependency in `GlueCatalog`, but the issue is more on the engine side that basically requires such dependency. The Flink catalog entry point `CatalogFactory.createCatalog(String name, Map<String, String> properties)` has a direct call to `createCatalog(name, properties, clusterHadoopConf())` that initializes Hadoop configuration, and the serialized catalog loader `CustomCatalogLoader` has `SerializableConfiguration` as a field, so you are guaranteed to get serialization exception in Flink if you don't have the Hadoop configuration. This looks like a deeper issue than just a fix at catalog side.\r\n\r\nI think we should first tackle this on engine side, and then see what's the best way forward for catalog implementations. This seems like a valid ask for Flink catalog factory improvement.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, although a bit hacky, why not add just 2 empty classes `Configuration` and `Configurable` to your classpath? That removes the need for the entire hadoop jar.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/910015259/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/910024430","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3035#issuecomment-910024430","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3035","id":910024430,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX842Pd7u","user":{"login":"jackye1995","id":29823233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODIzMjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29823233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995","html_url":"https://github.com/jackye1995","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-01T07:41:07Z","updated_at":"2021-09-01T07:41:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"can you also add the following integration test?\r\n\r\n```\r\n  @Test\r\n  public void testDropNamespace() {\r\n    Namespace namespace = Namespace.of(genRandomName());\r\n    catalog.createNamespace(namespace);\r\n    catalog.dropNamespace(namespace);\r\n    GetItemResponse response = dynamo.getItem(GetItemRequest.builder()\r\n        .tableName(catalogTableName)\r\n        .key(DynamoDbCatalog.namespacePrimaryKey(namespace))\r\n        .build());\r\n    Assert.assertFalse(\"namespace must not exist\", response.hasItem());\r\n  }\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/910024430/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/910380944","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3035#issuecomment-910380944","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3035","id":910380944,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX842Q0-Q","user":{"login":"bijanhoule","id":7012524,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMTI1MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7012524?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bijanhoule","html_url":"https://github.com/bijanhoule","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bijanhoule/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bijanhoule/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bijanhoule/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bijanhoule/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bijanhoule/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bijanhoule/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bijanhoule/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bijanhoule/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bijanhoule/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-01T15:11:30Z","updated_at":"2021-09-01T15:11:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> can you also add the following integration test?\r\n> \r\n> ...\r\n\r\nGood call, thank you!

The iceberg-aws module is a great example, it provides independent mock unit tests for the small feature,  the most important point is :  Adobe has provided the s3 integration test utility : [com.adobe.testing:s3mock-junit4](https://github.com/adobe/S3Mock),   it could just launch a local mini s3 cluster for accessing the HTTP API (the S3Mock pretend as a real S3 http server by implementing the S3 API under a local fs directory).  The S3Mock simulator have fully covered test cases to guarantee the local S3 has the same semantics as the [aws s3](https://aws.amazon.com/cn/s3/). \r\n\r\nWhen I implement [the aliyun OSS integration](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2230/files),  I thought I should provide a  similar object storage simulator to align between the local tests and public aliyun oss,  so I provided a [OSSMockApplication](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2230/files#diff-cae7d6bade136ee5e97da24f979e6352929af6df9d244a3afc3a94770396c1bc) and [TestLocalOSS](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2230/files#diff-f8329e3691562000032033a485ecc5e30bf6d6a3b7e25e5f8cdd4f4e387b604aR53) to align the semantics.  For my personal view,  I would prefer to provide a fully tested simulator for private vendor integration so that we could build unit tests on top of it to verify the correctness.\r\n\r\nAs we will introduce more and more public/private vendor integration in future,  I think we should consider agreeing on the details of introducing the vendor as soon as possible, and provide a more complete guide for community contributors to follow and implement.\r\n\r\nFYI @rdblue & @danielcweeks .

The iceberg-aws module is a great example, it provides independent mock unit tests for the small feature, the most important point is : Adobe has provided the s3 integration test utility : [com.adobe.testing:s3mock-junit4](https://github.com/adobe/S3Mock), it could just launch a local mini s3 cluster for accessing the HTTP API (the S3Mock pretend as a real S3 http server by implementing the S3 API under a local fs directory). The S3Mock simulator have fully covered test cases to guarantee the local S3 has the same semantics as the [aws s3](https://aws.amazon.com/cn/s3/).\r\n> \r\n> When I implement [the aliyun OSS integration](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2230/files), I thought I should provide a similar object storage simulator to align between the local tests and public aliyun oss, so I provided a [OSSMockApplication](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2230/files#diff-cae7d6bade136ee5e97da24f979e6352929af6df9d244a3afc3a94770396c1bc) and [TestLocalOSS](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2230/files#diff-f8329e3691562000032033a485ecc5e30bf6d6a3b7e25e5f8cdd4f4e387b604aR53) to align the semantics. For my personal view, I would prefer to provide a fully tested simulator for private vendor integration so that we could build unit tests on top of it to verify the correctness.\r\n> \r\n> As we will introduce more and more public/private vendor integration in future, I think we should consider agreeing on the details of introducing the vendor as soon as possible, and provide a more complete guide for community contributors to follow and implement.\r\n> \r\n> FYI @rdblue & @danielcweeks .\r\n\r\nI think in the ideal world we should, but I'm not sure if we need to completely block new contributions for cloud vendor integration if there is no working backend library for storage services that are available for unit test. In aws module we have an [integration test](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/tree/master/aws/src/integration/java/org/apache/iceberg/aws) package that talks to the actual service. However we don't run them during PR submission and they are run manually before each release. I think we should try to integrate them as one of the auto tests to catch regression. With or without a library that provides full functionality for unit testing, I think this integration test is still valuable.

Can you help me understand why this is specific to EMC?\r\n\r\nECS can append data to object. So the complex data cache of the S3 FileIO impl can be omit. \r\n\r\nThe ECSClient interface is for that if Amazon deprecated their V1 SDK, it's easily to create a new implementation of this interface.\r\n\r\nActually, the V2 SDK is same with V1 SDK. But just V1 SDK allow to custom HTTP headers that can help ECS and other object services to provide some extension feature.\r\nIf Iceberg need a V1-SDKed FileIO, I can help to implement one. The object writes will be same with current AWS implementation with a local data cache.\r\n\r\nECS also have its own SDK, but the license may cause some problems.
