Each fix lead to a new error that lead to a new fix. The XQTS and VXQuery test suite were used to make sure the change did not adversely affect the whole system. In fact, XQTS now has ~150 more passing queries. Since our current testing model only uses query and results, its possible to test some of these concepts independently but not all. \nCurrently, VXQuery does not have a query plan test suite. Although this could help test some of the changes to the system, I think we still have a long way to go to get a simplified optimized query plan. Query plan checking may require a lot of changes as we continue to expand support for XQuery. It would require thought as to what query plans we want to test and will not have future changes to their result (although this may not be avoidable).\nAs we start to get XMark queries working, they could be included into the VXQuery Test Suite to help make sure future changes do not break them. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/vxquery/issues/comments/129297857/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/vxquery/issues/comments/129636108","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/vxquery/pull/22#issuecomment-129636108","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/vxquery/issues/22","id":129636108,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyOTYzNjEwOA==","user":{"login":"shivanimall","id":5581525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1ODE1MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5581525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivanimall","html_url":"https://github.com/shivanimall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivanimall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivanimall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivanimall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivanimall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivanimall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivanimall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivanimall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivanimall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivanimall/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-10T22:40:49Z","updated_at":"2015-08-10T22:40:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This is ready to be reviewed again!
