are my attempts at **Flink 1.13.5 / 1.15.2, iceberg 1.14.1**  and the log logs generated by the task.\r\n\r\n> The following figure shows that the compression task has been in the Map stage：\r\n<img

of data compression OOM is inevitable, and the compression time will become longer and longer.\r\n\r\n I see that there are API methods   **appendsBetween() / appendsAfter()** related to incremental compression in the source code, does this mean that incremental compression can be used to replace the repeated compression process of full data in the future?\r\n\r\nthanks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1309843130/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1309985875","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/6166#issuecomment-1309985875","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/6166","id":1309985875,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85OFMxT","user":{"login":"pvary","id":19705742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzA1NzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19705742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary","html_url":"https://github.com/pvary","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-10T09:13:47Z","updated_at":"2022-11-10T09:13:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks

Currently, I only dealt with position deletes and my plan was to add 2 counters: # of pos delete files and # of rows within these position delete files.\r\nI haven't given a thought to equality deletes. The # of files might be useful for some extent but I don't know if the row count would give us any further insight for query planning or table maintenance. To have parity between the 2 types of delete files we might want to add the equality delete row count as well.\r\nI for sure didn't plan to apply the delete files to have counters that reflect the remaining rows/files.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1310484363/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1310487799","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/6171#issuecomment-1310487799","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/6171","id":1310487799,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85OHHT3","user":{"login":"thompson0012","id":51963680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxOTYzNjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51963680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thompson0012","html_url":"https://github.com/thompson0012","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thompson0012/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thompson0012/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thompson0012/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thompson0012/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thompson0012/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thompson0012/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thompson0012/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thompson0012/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thompson0012/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-10T15:44:18Z","updated_at":"2022-11-10T15:44:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"i know there are some issues found in #5993 , so i use this [images](https://hub.docker.com/r/jupyter/pyspark-notebook)\r\nwith the following .jars\r\n1.
