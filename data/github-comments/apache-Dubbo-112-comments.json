issue I found is, when I create a service configurator via nacos-config, for example, dataId =`dubbo-config-org.apache.dubbo.demo.DemoService.configurators` and group=`dubbo` in the default namespace (known as public in Nacos), and run the dubbo-demo, the configuration cannot be retrieved.\r\n\r\nThe reason is, if the namespace is not specified, Dubbo use \"dubbo\" as a default namespace, while Nacos use empty string \"\" as default namespace. So what I did is to remove the url that contains parameter \"namespace=dubbo\". In that case, Nacos will use empty String instead.\r\n\r\nBelow is the change I made to `NacosDynamicConfigurationFactory`:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n     protected DynamicConfiguration createDynamicConfiguration(URL url) {\r\n-        return new NacosDynamicConfiguration(url);\r\n+        URL nacosURL = url;\r\n+        if (Constants.DUBBO.equals(url.getParameter(PropertyKeyConst.NAMESPACE))) {\r\n+            // Nacos use empty string as default name space, replace default namespace \"dubbo\" to \"\"\r\n+            nacosURL = url.removeParameter(PropertyKeyConst.NAMESPACE);\r\n+        }\r\n+        return new NacosDynamicConfiguration(nacosURL);\r\n     }\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/490761071/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/490761529","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/4004#issuecomment-490761529","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4004","id":490761529,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MDc2MTUyOQ==","user":{"login":"ralf0131","id":4397305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTczMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4397305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131","html_url":"https://github.com/ralf0131","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-09T06:28:53Z","updated_at":"2019-05-09T06:28:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"What specific issue are you saying?

by the previous issue,  if we configure `dataId=dubbo-config-org.apache.dubbo.demo.DemoService.configurators` and `group=dubbo`, Dubbo still can not retrieve the configuration value during start up, listeners to the update works well.\r\n\r\nThe reason is in `org.apache.dubbo.registry.integration.AbstractConfiguratorListener#initWith`, there is a call to get config directly:\r\n\r\n```\r\nString rawConfig = dynamicConfiguration.getConfig(key);\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, since no group is passed, the `DEFAULT_GROUP` will be used in Nacos, therefore the config value could not be retrieved.\r\n\r\nSince in service governance configuration, Dubbo will always use \"dubbo\" as group. What I did is apply the following change to `AbstractConfiguratorListener`\r\n\r\n```\r\n-        String rawConfig = dynamicConfiguration.getConfig(key);\r\n+        String rawConfig = dynamicConfiguration.getConfig(key, Constants.DUBBO);\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen everything will work fine.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/490815333/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/490831177","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/pull/3775#issuecomment-490831177","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3775","id":490831177,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MDgzMTE3Nw==","user":{"login":"ralf0131","id":4397305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTczMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4397305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131","html_url":"https://github.com/ralf0131","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-09T09:32:23Z","updated_at":"2019-05-09T09:32:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@danielamorais The pull request is almost ready to be merged, there are still some issues pending to be resolved, would you please take a loot at it?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/490831177/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/490832945","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/pull/3988#issuecomment-490832945","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3988","id":490832945,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MDgzMjk0NQ==","user":{"login":"Moriadry-zz","id":6925549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjU1NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6925549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz","html_url":"https://github.com/Moriadry-zz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-09T09:37:21Z","updated_at":"2019-05-09T09:37:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you Huxing!
