To provide a little more context, the key change proposed here (besides the new `IRepacking` interface) is to the `IPacking` interface:\n\n```\n-  void initialize(Config config, Config runtime);\n+  void initialize(Config config, TopologyAPI.Topology topology);\n```\n\nThe goal is to make the initialize method for `IPacking` the same as for `IRepacking` to simplify classes that implement both. By standardizing on `Config config, TopologyAPI.Topology topology` we can do that but it's of course a breaking change for `IPacking` impls in the wild. I think that's ok (assuming we're ok with this signature) since we're still evolving the APIs and the refactor to `IPacking` impls would be straight forward.\n\nSee discussion in https://github.com/billonahill/heron/pull/4#discussion_r74977716 for more context.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/241158820/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/241160772","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/1287#issuecomment-241160772","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1287","id":241160772,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MTE2MDc3Mg==","user":{"login":"billonahill","id":23758,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNzU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23758?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill","html_url":"https://github.com/billonahill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-19T23:38:46Z","updated_at":"2016-08-19T23:38:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"So the issue was the wrong number of indent spaces?\n\n👍 \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/241160772/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/241163140","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/1287#issuecomment-241163140","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1287","id":241163140,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MTE2MzE0MA==","user":{"login":"objmagic","id":3656079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTYwNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3656079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic","html_url":"https://github.com/objmagic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-20T00:00:15Z","updated_at":"2016-08-20T00:00:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@billonahill no.

think the signature should match what the implementations typically (or contractually) need. In the case of `IPacking`, every implementation just fishes the Topology from the Runtime and then drops it:\n\n```\nthis.topology = com.twitter.heron.spi.utils.Runtime.topology(runtime);\n```\n\nso I think it makes sense to be more explicit with the init signature and pass the Topology itself. Unless we foresee a reason why one might need runtime for something else.\n\nIIRC during repacking we don't have the runtime available to us. @avflor correct me if I'm wrong. The `IScheduler` and `ILauncher` always has it at submission time though.\n\nThat said, I'm open for other suggestions.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/241810695/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/241817343","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/1285#issuecomment-241817343","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1285","id":241817343,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MTgxNzM0Mw==","user":{"login":"avflor","id":18666312,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjY2MzEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18666312?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor","html_url":"https://github.com/avflor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-23T17:52:51Z","updated_at":"2016-08-23T17:52:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I also agree with Bill that the runtime is not needed.

Currently there is no need.\n\nHowever I am worried about the cost of changing interface. A small change would require changing all implementations of IPacking, changing all test cases where methods are invoked directly, and potentially changing [power]mocks where methods could be invoked using reflection. The current pattern has enough headroom for future enhancements. It has some qualities of the Spring framework, where in the dependencies are injected into the implementation. For e.g. REEF is based on such a pattern.\n\nMy impression is that the confusion is created by incompleteness of the `runtime` config object. In this case I would prefer keeping the config object complete over changing the interface.
