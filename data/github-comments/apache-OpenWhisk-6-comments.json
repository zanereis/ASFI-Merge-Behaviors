This plan makes no changes to the API but will introduce a new flag in the CLI.\n\nThe basic strategy is that each new version of a runtime is identified by a unique string, and all runtime versions are peers -- there is no hierarchy.    So in particular, we currently have runtimes named \"nodejs\", \"swift\", and \"docker\" (and \"python\" when we handle the PR).\n\nStep 1 will be to simply introduce a new runtime \"swift3\" which is logically a peer of all the other variants.\nThis requires no API change.\n\nStep 2 will be to add a -type flag to wsk action create.   So wsk action create x.swift will create a \"swift\" action, but wsk action create -type \"swift3\" x.swift creates a \"swift3\" action.\n\nThat's basically it for the short term, and will satisfy our short term needs (modulo UI support).\n\nIn the medium term, we would rename our current runtimes to \"nodejs0.12.9\", \"swift2.2\", and \"python3.3\" (or whatever),   and then define aliases such as \"nodejs\" -> latest version of nodejs we support.    So \"nodejs\" would change it's meaning to mean \"the latest version supported in the system\".\n\nThat's basically it.    Please comment if you have an opinion.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/215214428/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/215216557","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/17#issuecomment-215216557","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/17","id":215216557,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNTIxNjU1Nw==","user":{"login":"perryibm","id":14339749,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzM5NzQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14339749?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/perryibm","html_url":"https://github.com/perryibm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perryibm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perryibm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perryibm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perryibm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perryibm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perryibm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perryibm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perryibm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perryibm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-27T20:23:33Z","updated_at":"2016-04-27T20:23:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Fine with me but to confirm.....\n\nIn both the short-term and medium-term of the proposal, the invoker will pull a distinct image from our registry for each runtime (or runtime + version).

In which granularity do we update? That's probably dependent on the runtime itself. \n- **node.js < 0** for example i would nail them to the minor version (nodejs0.12 for example).\n- **node.js > 4** though, i'ld go for just major version (nodejs4, nodejs5, nodejs6)\n\nA parseable naming-approach would be good aswell. For example we could follow docker's `:tag` approach to then have `nodejs:4`, `nodejs:5` and so on, while `nodejs:latest` would be a placeholder for the latest and greatest.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/215219573/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/215450049","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/267#issuecomment-215450049","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/267","id":215450049,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNTQ1MDA0OQ==","user":{"login":"ioana-blue","id":17202292,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjAyMjky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17202292?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue","html_url":"https://github.com/ioana-blue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-28T14:48:06Z","updated_at":"2016-04-28T14:48:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"fixed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/215450049/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/215506385","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/17#issuecomment-215506385","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/17","id":215506385,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNTUwNjM4NQ==","user":{"login":"csantanapr","id":1094878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTQ4Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1094878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr","html_url":"https://github.com/csantanapr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-28T17:41:53Z","updated_at":"2016-04-28T17:41:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"FYI:

It would be kind of tricky to get a simple sample to work out of the box.\n  Maybe we can show an action that shows how to use whisk.trigger() and there is a rule that comes in samples to listen to the trigger and invokes the forecast. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/216588113/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/216608142","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/188#issuecomment-216608142","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/188","id":216608142,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNjYwODE0Mg==","user":{"login":"jberstler","id":7012682,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMTI2ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7012682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jberstler","html_url":"https://github.com/jberstler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jberstler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jberstler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jberstler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jberstler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jberstler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jberstler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jberstler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jberstler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jberstler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-03T17:42:56Z","updated_at":"2016-05-03T17:42:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I feel like as samples (code we show to the customer to instruct them in the ways of OpenWhisk) a lot of these are so simple as to not provide much educational value.  For example, the differences between Hello, Echo, and WordCount do not provide _any_ clarity on what can be done by running this code on OpenWhisk - they are really just showing some very trivial things that can be done with the Swift language on any platform.\n\nIf the purpose of these samples is to teach the customer useful things they need to know about OpenWhisk, then I think one very simple Hello action would be appropriate. This shows them the basic structure of a Whisk action in Swift.  Beyond that, we probably want to start showing them samples that show the unique capabilities of OpenWhisk like... invoking other actions, firing triggers, etc.\n\nI realize that we don't currently have a `whisk` backend object that does these things in the same way that is available on, say, the Node.JS runtime, but maybe we should focus on creating that so we can implement more educational samples.\n\nThoughts?\n\n@sjfink I know you had reservations about exposing Kitura to the customer, but if we encapsulated use of Kitura to the implementation of functions like `invoke()` and `fireTrigger()` inside a `whisk` object that we make available to the customer's Swift code, then the customer will never know or care how it works under the hood.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/216608142/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/216608602","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/188#issuecomment-216608602","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/188","id":216608602,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNjYwODYwMg==","user":{"login":"csantanapr","id":1094878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTQ4Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1094878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr","html_url":"https://github.com/csantanapr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-03T17:44:36Z","updated_at":"2016-05-03T17:44:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@bjustin-ibm

A: travis timeout is going to bite us. the vagrant download takes about 25 mins. timeout is 50 mins. without forking this into a separate travis build, it is not going to work.\n- problem B: our
