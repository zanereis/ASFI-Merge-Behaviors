Some of the items are merely to get the build to work in my environments. \r\n\r\nMy main concern is that I have been unable to test this functionality in an integrated environment - Currently our organization is only using the Hive plugin and my analysis of the code suggests that only \"grant\" and \"revoke\" permission operations (in RangerBasePlugin) make use of RangerAccessResultProcessor, which seems to end up in the audit log. Our test environment does show such events, but I am fairly certain this does not actually use the Audit DB (with the new Elasticsearch support). I have prepared some test code that uses a local Elasticsearch to read and write events (ElasticSearchAccessAuditsServiceTest) but have been unable to test actual audit events in our integration test environment.\r\n\r\nDo you have any suggestions on how to properly test this?
