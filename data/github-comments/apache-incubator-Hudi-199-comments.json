HFile 2.x vs 1.x, its more about getting on a version that is not 5 years old :) . I don't think we saw any large perf improvements between 1.x and 2.x. I think even with the 1.x hbase we are on the ver 3 of HFile? (http://www.devdoc.net/bigdata/hbase-0.98.7-hadoop1/book/hfilev3.html , the HFile has its own version, like Hudi table version) @codope can chime in here as well. The urgency to do this stems from finalizing this before all the indexing work lands. \r\n\r\n>Should I just put the generated java classes inside the repo and get rid of the proto related files altogether?\r\n\r\nNeed to take a closer look. if proto is used to define the storage format. may be we should keep it in? How big is that\r\n\r\n\r\n>Regarding the new dependencies pulled in, I can further trim the list down if some can cause conflict, e.g., commons-lang3, protobuf:\r\n\r\nright. the desired way for us is to trim the HFile to much much smaller amount of code even. We should not bring in any new dependencies that Hudi has gotten rid of - commons-lang, guava. Otherwise it defeats the purpose a little bit. \r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1026923494/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1026932215","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/4695#issuecomment-1026932215","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4695","id":1026932215,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM49Nb33","user":{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-01T14:57:40Z","updated_at":"2022-02-01T14:57:40Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"at 66K lines, this is currently still too much code to maintain for return.

@ganczarek @nsivabalan  \r\nCurrently using the 0.5 jars which has no custom changes. Will check the possibility of writing custom key generator to overwrite getPartitionPath in hudi 0.5 code. . No other workarounds to achieve this ?  \r\n\r\nWe are planning to implement partitioning path like this s3://bucketname/folder1/partition_col_nm1=2015-01-01/ in 0.5 hudi release.  So even when hudi is upgraded from 0.5 to higher versions(say > 0.8) , the partitioning consistency will be maintained.

hey @ganczarek : looks like there is a bug https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-3346. we will work on the fix. should be straight forward. Atleast in this case, manually deleting the commit meta file just for this instant should be fine. Here is what could have resulted in this.\r\n> \r\n> Just before downgrade, a commit was started, but before going into inflight or before a single marker file could be created, the process crashed. And so there is no marker dir only created for this commit. Downgrade code missed to check for existence in one place (but there are other places where this check is made) and so it failed.\r\n> \r\n> I have created a tracking [ticket](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-3346) here. We are good to close this.\r\n\r\nSorry, I missed this.  There should be a check for marker directory before trying to delete it, which is missing before.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1028487024/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1028521054","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/4705#issuecomment-1028521054","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4705","id":1028521054,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM49Tfxe","user":{"login":"hudi-bot","id":79415918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDE1OTE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79415918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/hudi-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-03T01:35:05Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T01:35:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\nMeta

I have noticed that @XuQianJin-Stars have proposed the [RFC-47] **Add Call Produce Command for Spark SQL**(https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/4607), which will be a more generic way to support the hudi cli command.  This Pr can be a part of the RFC-47 so that we can unified the grammar for all the commands including the clustering command. So I think @XuQianJin-Stars can you take a look at the Pr and think the common way to support the hudi cli command.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1030626700/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1030628126","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/4667#issuecomment-1030628126","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4667","id":1030628126,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM49biMe","user":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-05T13:45:28Z","updated_at":"2022-02-05T13:45:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"just a thought.
