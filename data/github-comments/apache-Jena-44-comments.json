If the test comes out of a specific issue we generally leave a comment to that effect in the source code e.g. `// GH-2094` or for the test so future developers can understand the context of the test","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1840457816/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1841615597","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/issues/2120#issuecomment-1841615597","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/2120","id":1841615597,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec5txNLt","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-05T21:10:06Z","updated_at":"2023-12-05T21:10:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"org.wiremock:wiremock version 3.3.1 depends on Jetty11 which uses `jakarta.servlet`.\r\n\r\nWiremock switched from Jetty 9 (package space `javax.servlet`) to Jetty 11 (`jakarta.servlet`) at 3.0.0.\r\n\r\n\r\n> The changelog below represents key changes between 2.35.0 and 3.0.0.\r\n...\r\n> 💥 Breaking changes\r\n...\r\n> Upgrade from Jetty 9 to Jetty 11 (Changelog)\r\n \r\n\r\nApache Jena Fuseki 4.6.1 uses Jetty 10 (`javax.servlet`).\r\n\r\nJena is switching to `jakarta.servlet` with Jena 5.0.0.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1841615597/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1842394691","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/issues/2120#issuecomment-1842394691","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/2120","id":1842394691,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec5t0LZD","user":{"login":"AronBuzogany","id":108480125,"node_id":"U_kgDOBndGfQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108480125?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AronBuzogany","html_url":"https://github.com/AronBuzogany","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AronBuzogany/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AronBuzogany/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AronBuzogany/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AronBuzogany/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AronBuzogany/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AronBuzogany/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AronBuzogany/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AronBuzogany/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AronBuzogany/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-06T08:17:46Z","updated_at":"2023-12-06T08:24:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you for the detailed explanation!

One table header row and one table value row?\r\n\r\nIf it is just one line / row and we remove the sortable function we might already be done as the table outline looks neat and in place with the remain page elements.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1845022372/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1845971755","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/issues/1874#issuecomment-1845971755","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/1874","id":1845971755,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec5uB0sr","user":{"login":"Claudenw","id":2439838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0Mzk4Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2439838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Claudenw","html_url":"https://github.com/Claudenw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Claudenw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Claudenw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Claudenw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Claudenw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Claudenw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Claudenw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Claudenw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Claudenw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Claudenw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-07T19:25:41Z","updated_at":"2023-12-07T19:25:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The UpdateBuilder is missing the Node_Triple check.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1845971755/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1848670796","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/issues/2083#issuecomment-1848670796","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/2083","id":1848670796,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec5uMHpM","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-09T20:20:16Z","updated_at":"2023-12-09T20:20:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"We haven't heard back on this and can't reproduce it.\r\n\r\n@mpro7 Please do reopen this issue if there is new information.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1848670796/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1848683281","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/issues/2125#issuecomment-1848683281","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/2125","id":1848683281,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec5uMKsR","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-09T21:06:48Z","updated_at":"2023-12-09T21:06:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Mistake -

We are all volunteers, some contributors work actively with Jena, so they may have some extra $time to work on features required by employers.\r\n\r\n>There are issues (https://github.com/filip26/titanium-json-ld/issues/292, https://github.com/filip26/titanium-json-ld/issues/248 and others) preventing proper use of JSON-LD 1.1 in our use cases, and therefore, the use of Apache Jena itself, and it seems that these issues have no priority, probably due to lack of resources.\r\n\r\nIf you need that for a project, or for your $work, the best option here could be to hire someone to work on those issues, or maybe try to improve titanium-json-ld.\r\n\r\nFor me my main use cases involve the Fuseki UI, loading and querying simple ontologies, so I use my spare/volunteer time to focus on these areas. At $work I have very little use of Jena, so my bandwidth to work on Jena is limited -- other contributors/volunteers here might have similar situations, preventing them from working on those issues.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1852177820/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1855260425","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/issues/2083#issuecomment-1855260425","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/2083","id":1855260425,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec5ulQcJ","user":{"login":"mpro7","id":29251288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MjUxMjg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29251288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpro7","html_url":"https://github.com/mpro7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpro7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpro7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpro7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpro7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpro7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpro7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpro7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpro7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpro7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-14T07:04:55Z","updated_at":"2023-12-14T07:04:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@afs sorry for coming back late, we solved the issue which was on our side.

is probably where the implementation of `StreamRDF` implements `triple()` as `quad()` with default graph.  \r\nFrom the looks of it, in Jena 4.8 this produced TTL, while in Jena 4.9 it seems to

Could I ask what the code is trying to achieve by converting a triple to a quad if the intended output is Turtle (triples only)?\r\n\r\nNot really, sorry... we're dealing with some rather gnarly legacy code, and in this part of the code base there were tons of abstractions and wrappers, because historically this was designed to work both with a Jena or an RDF4J model underneath. But RDF4J had been removed long ago, so the abstractions had become rather pointless. When I inlined all that was going on, I ended up with something similar to the sample code I pasted above - and that's when it became obvious that the implementation does not make sense.  \r\nWe ended up removing some of the redundant abstractions, calling functionality on the Jena models directly, and that had already fixed our problem (as @mpro7 had pointed out).  \r\nIn the real code base, the function would also take in an RDFLanguage as a param; and then it would be used to transform a stram of RDF statements from one language to another - but that doesn't make `inner.quad(jena.sparql.core.Quad.create(jena.sparql.core.Quad.defaultGraphIRI, triple))` more sensible, of course.\r\n\r\nIn any case, our issue is fixed, no need to worry about that. But my example proves that the behaviour from Jena 4.8 to 4.9 has changed somewhat (and arguable a TTL-Parser should probably not return TRIG, even if it gets quads for triples), so if you want to investigate that, I hope my example helps.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1867813102/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1867929317","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/issues/2083#issuecomment-1867929317","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/2083","id":1867929317,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec5vVlbl","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-22T17:38:20Z","updated_at":"2023-12-22T17:38:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"#2133 puts back the behavior.

 I see guava was added for use not that long ago, would it make sense to add the dependency to the service-enhancer pom.xml? to ensure that it is loaded, or could it be that it is my user error?\r\n\r\nI thought actually the opposite was true, Guava was removed in favour of [ben-manes/caffeine](https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine) since we were only really using Guava for caching and the lack of stability in Guava APIs meant we were having to mess around with shading which we no longer wanted to do.\r\n\r\nSo this might be a side-effect of that, the service enhancer plugin previously assumed that it would get Guava transitively from elsewhere in Jena which is no longer true.\r\n\r\nSo yes probably two options:\r\n\r\n- Short term - explicitly add Guava as a local dependency to your Fuseki Classpath\r\n- Long term - create a new issue and PR to migrate the plugin to using the new preferred cache

I would greatly appreciate it if you could include my implementation in your benchmarking tests.\r\n\r\nMy own benchmarks and tests suggest that this implementation of a SWMR+ graph will soon be viable for deployment with our clients. However, it's important to note that testing and documentation are still works in progress, and some refactoring is anticipated. Despite these ongoing developments, the implementation is functioning as intended and meets our speed requirements.\r\n\r\nIn our use case, we manage a graph with approximately 600,000 triples. We face a demanding scenario where 375,000 triples are updated every three seconds, alongside smaller updates involving about 100 triples every second. This occurs concurrently with eight threads, each reading all triples once per second. On my new notebook, which has sufficient processing power, I've been able to simulate this scenario in a single unit test. You can find these tests here:\r\n\r\n- [testOneThreadUpdatingWithSeveralThreadsReading](https://github.com/arne-bdt/jena/blob/5c230d1697b3a2a14cff7ee6328d599cf8699feb/jena-benchmarks/jena-benchmarks-jmh/src/test/java/org/apache/jena/mem/graph/TestMEASTransactional2.java#L316)\r\n\r\n- [testMultipleThreadsUpdatingWithSeveralThreadsReading](https://github.com/arne-bdt/jena/blob/5c230d1697b3a2a14cff7ee6328d599cf8699feb/jena-benchmarks/jena-benchmarks-jmh/src/test/java/org/apache/jena/mem/graph/TestMEASTransactional2.java#L187)\r\n\r\nTo run these tests, you'll need to check out my [SMMR_Dataset branch ](https://github.com/arne-bdt/jena/tree/SWMR_Dataset) to get it running.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1890770500/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1890975847","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/issues/2172#issuecomment-1890975847","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/2172","id":1890975847,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec5wtgBn","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-14T14:59:36Z","updated_at":"2024-01-14T14:59:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@kinow - that was quick!
