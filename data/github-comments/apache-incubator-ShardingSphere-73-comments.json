The lock is worked in another dependent jar related to db, and it's just a distributed lock for intializing. To keep the jar pure, we don't want to introduce another jar like zookeeper or redis for a distribute lock in the jar at moment.  Keeping the lock and release work on the same database is just ok for us at moment.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/541275875/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/541281984","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/3207#issuecomment-541281984","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/3207","id":541281984,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MTI4MTk4NA==","user":{"login":"xiyelife","id":8772975,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NzI5NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8772975?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiyelife","html_url":"https://github.com/xiyelife","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiyelife/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiyelife/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiyelife/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiyelife/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiyelife/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiyelife/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiyelife/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiyelife/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiyelife/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-12T04:03:19Z","updated_at":"2019-10-12T06:38:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tristaZero @terrymanu  use the latest version , when insert by mybatis, the parameters were still found to be out of ordered.
