I just have one major concern.  The way to select the serialization method appears to be a cluster wide configuration, but seems to be read from the topology configuration.  At a minimum the configuration should begin with \"topology.\" but I would really prefer to have it be something that subclasses to ShellSpout and ShellBolt set.  I can easily see a topology where some ShellBolts are using JSON, and others are using a custom binary protocol.
