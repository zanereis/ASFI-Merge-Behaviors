I think your main point is valid, namely that there are circumstances, pointed out by you, when gremlin-driver should select the GSSAPI mechanism even though no JAAS_ENTRY is specified (ToDo: make a test for this to safeguard the desired behavior).\r\nHaving said this, the old behavior (select GSSAPI out of the blue if no username/password is supplied) also has its risks and problems given the multitude of SASL mechanisms that people could want to use, see [http://www.iana.org/assignments/sasl-mechanisms/sasl-mechanisms.xhtml](http://www.iana.org/assignments/sasl-mechanisms/sasl-mechanisms.xhtml). Ideally, one would want gremlin-server to provide a token with the mechanism(s) it supports, so that gremlin-driver can use this to instantiate the SaslClient properly. \r\nIn your case, with `javax.security.auth.useSubjectCredsOnly=false` configured, you would have a Gremlin-Server with a Krb5Authenticator configured, the server would provide the GSSAPI token in its authentication request and gremlin-driver would know to select the GSSAPI mechanism. \r\nHowever, this ideal situation requires more changes to the gremlin-driver and gremlin-server code. \r\nI could live now with adding the GSSException as an option to the tests with your explanation how it could be a valid option. This solves the current challenge and we can add this discussion as comments to the code for future reference, when requirements for other SASL mechanisms pop up.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/275509230/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/275639513","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/534#issuecomment-275639513","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/534","id":275639513,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NTYzOTUxMw==","user":{"login":"mike-tr-adamson","id":2841496,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NDE0OTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2841496?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tr-adamson","html_url":"https://github.com/mike-tr-adamson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tr-adamson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tr-adamson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tr-adamson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tr-adamson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tr-adamson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tr-adamson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tr-adamson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tr-adamson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tr-adamson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-27T10:53:44Z","updated_at":"2017-01-27T10:53:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @vtslab, the majority of SASL mechanisms that are suitable for this form of authentication require some form of credential, be it token or certificate, at the client end. I agree that these are best approached separately.\r\n\r\n> In your case, with javax.security.auth.useSubjectCredsOnly=false configured, you would have a Gremlin-> Server with a Krb5Authenticator configured, the server would provide the GSSAPI token in its\r\n> authentication request and gremlin-driver would know to select the GSSAPI mechanism.\r\n\r\nThe ideal solution, in my mind anyway, would be for the server to announce which mechanism it wants the client to use. This would allow for a quick fail on the client side if any credentials required by the mechanism weren't available. It ought to be quite straightforward to add this to the authenticate response from the server. It would certainly take away some of the guessing.\r\n\r\nI'm not suggesting that this change is done here but may be something for a future enhancement to the authentication.\r\n ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/275639513/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/275672319","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/550#issuecomment-275672319","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/550","id":275672319,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NTY3MjMxOQ==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-27T14:05:39Z","updated_at":"2017-01-27T14:05:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for this.
