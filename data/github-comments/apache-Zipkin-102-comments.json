this will bump anyone actively not interested in moving to okhttp v4 with the reverse problem. I think recently @vietj had a concern of some kind about okhttp version, presumably due to zipkin-junit.\r\n\r\nThere's no plan to remove MWS from zipkin-junit as this hasn't caused any problems and it is unlikely armeria will cause less in a testing tool.\r\n\r\nIn other words even if we use armeria directly in zipkin-server, it doesn't affect the decision in zipkin-junit. For this reason, I don't think it should be joined in any way to the dependency tree in zipkin-server. please keep this a discussion of which version zipkin-junit should use.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/546908793/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/546912209","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/2889#issuecomment-546912209","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2889","id":546912209,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NjkxMjIwOQ==","user":{"login":"adriangonz","id":1577620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzc2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1577620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adriangonz","html_url":"https://github.com/adriangonz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adriangonz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adriangonz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adriangonz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adriangonz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adriangonz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adriangonz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adriangonz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adriangonz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adriangonz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-28T11:52:13Z","updated_at":"2019-10-28T11:52:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Got it.
