, thanks for your feedback. Actually I also have the same idea to implementation my own AllocateMessageQueueStrategy to select the canary queues. Also it seems we need to implement the MessageSelector based on the same selection algo to distinguish the canary producer. And we need to dynamically twist the ration of canary traffic to exiting production traffic. So this becomes complicated and I do implemented a POC to do that, but it seems not graceful enough. So I am wondering whether there is a existing solution with current RMQ release, unluckily it seems not :( .  I have to improve my solution now.
