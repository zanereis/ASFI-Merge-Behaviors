I looked at ZEPPELIN-3913 and it mainly aims at streaming engine based on Flink.  I think it is better to use new version Flink (currently 1.7) as starting point  of streaming engine, and this PR is only for current batch engine and does not introduce extra functions, current tests could cover the modifications. So I think this PR and issue ZEPPELIN-3914 could be a subtask of  ZEPPELIN-3913 and does not conflicts with ZEPPELIN-3913.\r\nWhat do you think ? @zjffdu ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/447726974/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/447728150","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/3266#issuecomment-447728150","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/3266","id":447728150,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NzcyODE1MA==","user":{"login":"zjffdu","id":164491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu","html_url":"https://github.com/zjffdu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-17T05:39:09Z","updated_at":"2018-12-17T05:39:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@xueyumusic Thanks for the contribution, we can make it as subtask of ZEPPELIN-3913.
