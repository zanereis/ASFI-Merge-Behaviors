Pinot will actually replace the column with `CAST(myCol AS LONG)`.\r\n\r\nSo there are 2 problems:\r\n1. Column in WHERE clause should not be treated as alias because it is not allowed to access alias in WHERE clause\r\n2. Currently we cannot do NULL filter on transformed column. @shenyu0127 is working on filter NULL support, and should be able to support this\r\n\r\nSeems using an existing column name as alias is not best practice because that can cause confusion","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1645222587/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1645464366","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/11148#issuecomment-1645464366","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/11148","id":1645464366,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5iE8su","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-21T11:54:52Z","updated_at":"2023-07-21T12:36:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## [Codecov](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/11148?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=apache) Report\n> Merging [#11148](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/11148?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=apache) (a018118) into [master](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/commit/12ddd3310b65c2e3e871a8fba0c8ccc503afd980?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=apache) (12ddd33) will **not change** coverage.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n```diff\n@@           Coverage Diff           @@\n##           master   #11148   +/-   ##\n=======================================\n  Coverage    0.11%    0.11%           \n=======================================\n  Files        2205     2205           \n  Lines      118328   118328           \n  Branches    17908    17908           \n=======================================\n  Hits          137      137           \n  Misses     118171   118171           \n  Partials       20       20           \n```\n\n| Flag | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| integration1temurin11 | `0.00% <ø> (ø)` | |\n| integration1temurin17 | `0.00% <ø> (ø)` | |\n| integration1temurin20 | `0.00% <ø> (ø)` | |\n| integration2temurin11 | `0.00% <ø> (?)` | |\n| integration2temurin17 | `0.00% <ø> (ø)` | |\n| integration2temurin20 | `0.00% <ø> (ø)` | |\n| unittests1temurin11 | `0.00% <ø> (?)` | |\n| unittests1temurin17 | `0.00% <ø> (ø)` | |\n| unittests1temurin20 | `0.00% <ø> (ø)` | |\n| unittests2temurin11 | `0.11% <ø> (ø)` | |\n| unittests2temurin17 | `0.11% <ø> (ø)` | |\n| unittests2temurin20 | `0.11% <ø> (ø)` | |\n\nFlags with carried forward coverage won't be shown.

LOL i didn't know KLL and Tuples are actually a different sketches :-) thank you for the notes. \r\n\r\nqq: does it matter what sketch is being used? the scalar function here doesn't really know what sketch is being used, all it does is \r\n1. extract the sketch from binary or stringified format\r\n2. apply set operation (optionally)\r\n3. compute the estimate. \r\n\r\ndo we need different handling for KLL or Tuple based
