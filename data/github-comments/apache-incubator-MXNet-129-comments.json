for your answer tornadomeet, I think your suggestion might be equivalent to setting forward(is_train=True) in the predict call? This does provide dropout uncertainty but I believe it is only homoscedastic - i.e. it assumes that the uncertainty of the target variable in relation to predictor variables is consistent throughout the predictor variable feature space, which is not the case in my application. \r\n\r\nThe reason to use random drop during test is to get a probabilistic output - i.e. with dropout on you can re-run predict x times to build up a probability distribution, the spread of which provides an indication of the uncertainty of the prediction. Yarin Gal has written a [very good article](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/yarin/blog_3d801aa532c1ce.html) about this.\r\n\r\nThanks for your answer tqchen. Would that allow the spread of prediction uncertainty for the target variable to become data dependent?\r\n\r\nThe aim is to achieve the lower of these two images, standard dropout uncertainty
