And also how are you enforcing a maximum dynamic bloom filter size. Can you share data on how big the bloom filter would be, if you say wrote 1M keys at fpp ratio 10^-9\r\n\r\nFew questions/clarifications:\r\n- I guess you can't bound the size in dynamic bloom filter. Size will grow according to the number to entries added. Initialize number of entries passed will be used to set the min size. \r\n- I am trying to find ways to test the FP ratio. Not sure how would you test that. \r\n- I was able to verify that adding more entries to the filter than the initial size, increases the size of the bloom. \r\n- Here are the sizes of dynamic bloom filter with error rate 10^-9 and initial number of entries as 10k\r\n Size of bloom with 100 entries = 71940 bytes ~= 71kb\r\n Size of bloom with 1000 entries = 71940 bytes ~= 71kb\r\n Size of bloom with 10000 entries = 71940 bytes ~= 71kb\r\n Size of bloom with 100000 entries = 719088 bytes ~= 720kb\r\n Size of bloom with 1000000 entries  = 7190568 bytes ~= 7.1 MB\r\n- Not sure if we really need to have a (unit) test to ensure that size grows when no of entries added increases. Only assertion we can do is to verify that the size is greater when compared to smaller no of entries are added.

Currently we have a low default 60K, which comes out to reading ~400kb from the parquet footer. not too shabby a overhead.. My understanding is that the parquet footers are all read at once and even query engines would read the footer.. So if we don't bound the size of the dynamic bloom fitler to say 1MB or so, queries can pay a penalty? (I dont know how big this would be or if its okay) But we won't offer the user the choice to make tradeoffs.. IIUC we need our own impl of dynamic bloom if we were to limit the size.. correct? how doable is that? \r\n\r\n>I am trying to find ways to test the FP ratio. Not sure how would you test that.\r\nThe way I have done it in the past, is to generate a lot of key and hold it in two lists : added, notAdded.. I add the ones from `added` to bloom filter and then check for false positives using notAdded list.. how much % of not added had a hit is your fp.. For this impl, we need ensure that the fp ratio remains the same, even as you increase the size of added/notAdded lists.. \r\n\r\nOther small points:\r\n- if we don't have a way to configure the bloom type to use, we should add one\r\n- We should consider if the default here should be `the error rate 10^-9`. This will also help reduce the size.. we already have techniques like range pruning  to reduce the amount of comparisons.. Assuming even a large 100M entries inserted into a partition, if the bloom filter had `10^-8`, it might be enough prevent  false positives right.. I guess this will drop the storage needed considerably? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/549065995/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/549066188","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/623#issuecomment-549066188","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/623","id":549066188,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0OTA2NjE4OA==","user":{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-02T17:50:02Z","updated_at":"2019-11-02T17:50:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@n3nash has a PR up I think #991 . if you have not started on a bunch of work already, we can use that and see how to improve upon?

Currently we have a low default 60K, which comes out to reading ~400kb from the parquet footer. not too shabby a overhead.. My understanding is that the parquet footers are all read at once and even query engines would read the footer.. So if we don't bound the size of the dynamic bloom fitler to say 1MB or so, queries can pay a penalty? (I dont know how big this would be or if its okay) But we won't offer the user the choice to make tradeoffs.. IIUC we need our own impl of dynamic bloom if we were to limit the size.. correct? how doable is that?\r\n> \r\n> > I am trying to find ways to test the FP ratio. Not sure how would you test that.\r\n> > The way I have done it in the past, is to generate a lot of key and hold it in two lists : added, notAdded.. I add the ones from `added` to bloom filter and then check for false positives using notAdded list.. how much % of not added had a hit is your fp.. For this impl, we need ensure that the fp ratio remains the same, even as you increase the size of added/notAdded lists..\r\n> \r\n> Other small points:\r\n> \r\n> * if we don't have a way to configure the bloom type to use, we should add one\r\n> * We should consider if the default here should be `the error rate 10^-9`. This will also help reduce the size.. we already have techniques like range pruning  to reduce the amount of comparisons.. Assuming even a large 100M entries inserted into a partition, if the bloom filter had `10^-8`, it might be enough prevent  false positives right.. I guess this will drop the storage needed considerably?\r\n\r\nThanks Vinoth for the detailed response. \r\n- To bound the dynamic bloom, we have two options. a. I can google to find if we have some ready to use solution. b. If nothing exists, we can come up with our own DynamicBloom with max bounds on the no of entries. Just that until we reach the max no of entries, the FP ratio will be honored, after which the FP ratio may start to increase. I can get this done. \r\n- Wrt testing FP ratio, thanks for the idea. I had similar idea. \r\n- Here are the size differences between FP ratio 10^-8 and 10^-9. Key size considered is 50 bytes. \r\n\r\nSize | FP 10^-8 | FP 10^-9\r\n-- | -- | --\r\n10k | 380k | 430k\r\n100k | 760k | 860k\r\n1M | 6.5MB | 7.3MB\r\n10M | 64MB | 72MB\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/549160133/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/549182632","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/623#issuecomment-549182632","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/623","id":549182632,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0OTE4MjYzMg==","user":{"login":"n3nash","id":2722167,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MjIxNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2722167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash","html_url":"https://github.com/n3nash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-03T21:50:51Z","updated_at":"2019-11-03T21:50:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing this one in favor of the new one","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/549182632/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/549183685","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/991#issuecomment-549183685","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/991","id":549183685,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0OTE4MzY4NQ==","user":{"login":"n3nash","id":2722167,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MjIxNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2722167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash","html_url":"https://github.com/n3nash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-03T22:03:02Z","updated_at":"2019-11-03T22:03:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vinothchandar @bvaradar I've tried to address most of your comments you had in this PR : https://github.com/apache/incubator-hudi/pull/623.

I had removed the shading of Hive from `hudi-spark-bundle` to unblock this PR, but not from `hudi-utilities-bundle` and thats why this issue occurs through DeltaStreamer which uses shaded Hive. The reason for this happening is I have added `Hive.get` in this code, and `Hive` class exists in `hive-exec` which has not been shaded in Hudi until now, and ideally should not be because its a fat jar itself. But `HiveConf` is shaded and relocated.\r\n\r\nI think we need to take a larger call here, whether its fine to remove Hive shading from `hudi-utilities-bundle` or not. And with this change of introducing `Hive.get` even if Hive is shaded it will still break, because `hive-exec` is not being shaded while other modules are being shaded. So it will cause this `NoSuchMethodError`. Need your suggestions on whether we should completely move out of shading Hive.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/549577195/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/549589386","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/993#issuecomment-549589386","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/993","id":549589386,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0OTU4OTM4Ng==","user":{"login":"leesf","id":10128888,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTI4ODg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10128888?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leesf","html_url":"https://github.com/leesf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leesf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leesf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leesf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leesf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leesf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leesf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leesf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leesf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leesf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-04T23:09:21Z","updated_at":"2019-11-04T23:09:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vinothchandar

Thanks for making this PR!\r\n\r\nI've been working on upgrading HUDI to Spark 2.4 internally at Uber! So I'll list out a few things that I had to do, so that you're not trying to re-discover these things yourself :) \r\n\r\n1. Some of the `create` functions in `HoodieWrapperFileSystem` don't fully work with Parquet 1.10+. See [here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-hudi/blob/b19bed442d84c1cb1e48d184c9554920735bcb6c/hudi-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/common/io/storage/HoodieWrapperFileSystem.java#L146). We'll need to make sure that all the `create` functions correctly call `wrapOutputStream`. \r\n2. `hive-exec` is a fat JAR. It might be causing unit tests failure as it may introduce an older version of avro into the calsspath. We're currently trying to figure out how to address this. Let us know if you have any suggestions! \r\n\r\nBtw - I also went to UIUC! Great to meet new Illini!

Thanks for making this PR!\r\n> \r\n> I've been working on upgrading HUDI to Spark 2.4 internally at Uber! So I'll list out a few things that I had to do, so that you're not trying to re-discover these things yourself :)\r\n> \r\n>     1. Some of the `create` functions in `HoodieWrapperFileSystem` don't fully work with Parquet 1.10+. See [here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-hudi/blob/b19bed442d84c1cb1e48d184c9554920735bcb6c/hudi-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/common/io/storage/HoodieWrapperFileSystem.java#L146). We'll need to make sure that all the `create` functions correctly call `wrapOutputStream`.\r\n> \r\n>     2. `hive-exec` is a fat JAR. It might be causing unit tests failure as it may introduce an older version of avro into the calsspath. We're currently trying to figure out how to address this. Let us know if you have any suggestions!\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> Btw - I also went to UIUC! Great to meet new Illini!\r\n\r\n@modi95 good to hear from a fellow Illini !\r\n\r\nAbout the points you raised:\r\n\r\n1.  I guess I am not quite sure yet, where this comes into the picture. Did you run into an actual issue ? Is there an easy way to reproduce this ?\r\n\r\n2. Yeah I need to look into the test failures. Not sure of the reasons yet. But first thing I guess I need to do is upgrade the docker images right, to use spark 2.4.4 and probably hive 2.3.6 ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/552682699/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/552683643","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/1005#issuecomment-552683643","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1005","id":552683643,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MjY4MzY0Mw==","user":{"login":"umehrot2","id":8647012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NDcwMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8647012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umehrot2","html_url":"https://github.com/umehrot2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umehrot2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umehrot2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umehrot2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umehrot2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umehrot2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umehrot2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umehrot2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umehrot2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umehrot2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-12T00:50:56Z","updated_at":"2019-11-12T00:50:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Change looks good.
