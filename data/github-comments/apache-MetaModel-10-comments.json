\r\n> \r\n> Really appreciate the backwards-compatible approach used here, and the fact that all existing tests are unaltered. My only nitpick is that there are some indentation differences in some of the files. For example `ExcelConfiguration`. But it does also look like the source files have inconsistent indentation so I can live with it, just a note for us that it looks like we need to reformat some files.\r\n\r\nYeah, I didn't apply any formatting on purpose, because then I usually have to undo a lot of changes it makes on code that I did not tough. I can try to apply that now.\r\nI also think that this project's code in general really needs refactoring, because the current is hard to understand and messy right now. That should probably be done in another PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/562025565/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/564048809","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metamodel/pull/235#issuecomment-564048809","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/235","id":564048809,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NDA0ODgwOQ==","user":{"login":"kaspersorensen","id":291450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTQ1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/291450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen","html_url":"https://github.com/kaspersorensen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-10T14:08:57Z","updated_at":"2019-12-10T14:08:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/564048809/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/564522235","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metamodel/pull/235#issuecomment-564522235","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/235","id":564522235,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NDUyMjIzNQ==","user":{"login":"arjansh","id":16542747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTQyNzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16542747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjansh","html_url":"https://github.com/arjansh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjansh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjansh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjansh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjansh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjansh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjansh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjansh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjansh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjansh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-11T12:40:37Z","updated_at":"2019-12-11T12:40:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@kaspersorensen If this looks good to you, shouldn't we/one of us merge it then?
