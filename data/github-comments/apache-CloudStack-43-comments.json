@miguelaferreira \n\nOkay for the Marvin test, but then it will make the thing wait for another day, at least. Which is fine, but I hope people LGTM it afterwards. I'm worried about the lack of reviews/tests by reviewers on PRs.\n\nConcerning the unit test, I won't add it because I want to refactor the code as a project and have it done in a way that we can add tests and refactor, as it was done with other components. I know it could be done in a way where I could refactor just 1 method, add a tests and push it. However, I do not want to mix styles in the Python code.\n\nBy styles I mean: the way it was developed and the way I would have developed it. So, mixing styles by refactoring 1 method to add 1 test will not really improve it. Once we release 4.6, and if that okay with the team, I, we, will work on the python refactor.\n\nCheers,\nWilder\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/136664670/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/136667092","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/768#issuecomment-136667092","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/768","id":136667092,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNjY2NzA5Mg==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-01T10:26:56Z","updated_at":"2015-09-01T10:26:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[cloudstack-pull-rats #465](https://builds.apache.org/job/cloudstack-pull-rats/465/) SUCCESS\nThis pull request looks good\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/136667092/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/136667361","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/765#issuecomment-136667361","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/765","id":136667361,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNjY2NzM2MQ==","user":{"login":"miguelaferreira","id":4670993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NzA5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4670993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira","html_url":"https://github.com/miguelaferreira","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-01T10:28:46Z","updated_at":"2015-09-01T10:28:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@wilderrodrigues ok for the python unit tests, but I would really like a marvin test, or al least some way to automate setting up the environment you described.
