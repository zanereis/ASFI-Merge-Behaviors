We had the issue at a rate of ~10 files per week with an app producing hundreds of files per hour. \r\n\r\n@amogh-jahagirdar  And yes I know that the file name is not only the query id. But I think the other elements can definitively repeat (`taskId` and `partitionId`). What I'm not sure of is the `fileCount` part. I think it is kept in memory but resets when the app is restarted (ie: not part of the state). So my point is: with a UUID this can't happen (barring the UUID collision) as whatever collisions on the other part of the filename are handled by a uniq part. \r\nAnother fix could be to keep the `operationId` but add an UUID as well.
