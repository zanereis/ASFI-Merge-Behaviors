the upgrading of production related software lies under an admin or a person with proper ACLs who defiantly reads the documentation before upgrading. If there is a section in `Upgrade Docs` which indicates `Breaking changes in 0.8.x`, then it is easy to just point the person to a script that can be even downloaded remotely with instructions of how it works. (maybe a place on git called migration):\r\n\r\n1. Copy `Notebook` and `conf` directories to `0.8.0`,\r\n2. `curl` the script and run it pointing to new `Notebook` directory,\r\n3. Start the new Zeppelin.\r\n\r\nPS: I would say let's have a script and a notebook available for those who would prefer either. But not shipped with Zeppelin. I don't want this Note or script do anything automatically.
