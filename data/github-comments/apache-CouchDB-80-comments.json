@nicknaychov, are you talking about the `placement` option described here?\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/cluster/sharding.html#specifying-database-placement\r\n\r\nThat setting controls which nodes host replicas of database shards. CouchDB has some internal optimizations to preferentially retrieve DB metadata from nodes in the same zone as the node handling the incoming HTTP request, but general R/W traffic will cross zones and communicate with every replica of a database shard as needed. Typically the placement setting is used to ensure replicas are distributed to different fault domains, e.g. different availability zones in a cloud region.\r\n\r\nIf you want to confirm that the placement you configured took effect for a particular database you can query the `_shards` endpoint:\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/api/database/shard.html\r\n\r\nEven in the case where you configured the placement so that the shards for database A are hosted on one set of nodes and the shards for database B are hosted on another set, the cluster will still cross zones as needed to satisfy R/W requests. For example, you could submit a request to one of the nodes hosting A asking to read a document for B and that request will succeed -- it will just issue the internal RPCs to retrieve the document data from the nodes in the other zone.\r\n\r\nHopefully that makes sense. Also dropping the `rfc` label as that's intended for formal proposals to enhance CouchDB.
