Looks like it is now a wrapper around a `StringWriter`. Still, the goal of this class is to take a bunch of arguments and produce a string. That string can be printed, sent to a log, or just displayed in the debugger. (It is the debugger case that I was probably concerned about; some classes threw exceptions if you tried to examine them in the debugger.)\r\n\r\nGiven that this class is a string *builder* and not a string *printer*, the `append()` method evokes the `append()` method in `StringBuilder`. This may be the point that @vrozov is making.\r\n\r\nThat said, there is certainly no harm in changing the name if it helps people understand the purpose of the class more clearly. Since this is purely an internal debug class, either name is fine.\r\n\r\nIn fact, thinking about this `print()` may be slightly better: we are not literally printing to paper, but we are formatting the data for display. `append()` is more of a low-level operation, `print()` implies formatting for readability by humans.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/385274339/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/385276120","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1236#issuecomment-385276120","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1236","id":385276120,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NTI3NjEyMA==","user":{"login":"Kui-Liu","id":17425450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDI1NDUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17425450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kui-Liu","html_url":"https://github.com/Kui-Liu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kui-Liu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kui-Liu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kui-Liu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kui-Liu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kui-Liu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kui-Liu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kui-Liu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kui-Liu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kui-Liu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-29T19:43:07Z","updated_at":"2018-04-29T19:43:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vrozov Thanks.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/385276120/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/385290273","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1235#issuecomment-385290273","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1235","id":385290273,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NTI5MDI3Mw==","user":{"login":"vrozov","id":12200381,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjAwMzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12200381?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov","html_url":"https://github.com/vrozov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-29T23:30:21Z","updated_at":"2018-04-29T23:30:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"My take is that \"append\" is more common for classes with the similar functionality, see for example `ToStringBuilder`.

By default, it will be YARN if cgroups are enabled in YARN, as they can be for Apache YARN.\r\n\r\nIt is then fine to have an additional option to enable self-enforcement in Drill for those odd cases where users cannot or choose not to use versions of YARN that do the work.\r\n\r\nThe problem would be if the user has to configure CPU in two places: in a shell script to enable self-enforcement, and in the DoY config to tell YARN the container size. This goes against the ease-of-use experience DoY was designed to provide.

The main difficulty in cross join is the management of the memory needed to produce a cartesian product (M x N). In cross apply though, the cross join is only computed on one row in the left side at a time (1 x N), since the left and right sides are correlated. This allows cross apply to operate with a very small amount of memory.

The problem is that return type was chosen incorrectly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/387434799/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/387473728","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1252#issuecomment-387473728","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1252","id":387473728,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NzQ3MzcyOA==","user":{"login":"vrozov","id":12200381,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjAwMzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12200381?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov","html_url":"https://github.com/vrozov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-08T17:08:24Z","updated_at":"2018-05-08T17:08:24Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"In addition to disabling unused imports, it will be good to disable wildcard imports as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/387473728/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/387474411","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1237#issuecomment-387474411","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1237","id":387474411,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NzQ3NDQxMQ==","user":{"login":"sachouche","id":29960235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTYwMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29960235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachouche","html_url":"https://github.com/sachouche","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachouche/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachouche/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachouche/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachouche/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachouche/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachouche/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachouche/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachouche/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachouche/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-08T17:10:53Z","updated_at":"2018-05-08T17:10:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Implemented the changes suggested by @vrozov and fixed a memory leak warning message as the receive operators were closed before the buffers.

This doesn't cover import order. From what I vaguely remember with Apache Apex, import order was a highly controversial topic. I want to avoid that discussion for now and get everybody comfortable with adding more checkstyle checks bit by bit. Once people are more comfortable with stricter checkstyle checks I am hoping a discussion about adding import order checks can reach a consensus quicker.\r\n2. I will refactor into two commits as you suggested.\r\n3. I wasn't planning on adding any documentation about this now since the checkstyle errors are pretty descriptive. However, I was planning on writing a Checkstyle.md which will explain how to import a checkstyle.xml into your IDE so that you can see checkstyle warnings within your IDE as well as autoformat your code according to Drill's checkstyle config. Chandni figured out all these things for Apache Apex, but I don't think it's documented anywhere.

We retain only the first N (which are, implicitly, the latest profiles). If we were to add more profiles  than the max capacity, the TreeSet is pruned at the rightmost end.\r\nWith Guava, the eviction policy provides the option of limiting the size, but the basis on which it would evict a profile would not work with the least-recently used/accessed profile.\r\nAlso, this is currently not a true cache, because the moment we detect changes in the underlying store, we reconstruct this 'cache'. Ideally, we'd want to identify the newest profiles returned from the FileSystem (using filename filters), but the Hadoop API performance is the same (irrespective of the filter).\r\nWe, primarily, save the time in fetching file list from the FS and in deserializing.\r\nI can move the implementation of the TreeSet to a separate class to clean up the code. That would make debugging simpler too. With Guava, I don't see the value add beyond a lower risk of bugs, which should be minimal with the TreeSet too.

You wanted a cache that will always only contain the **N** most recently created profiles. If you happen to access the **N + 1**th youngest profile, the cache will not contain it and will never contain it, the cache will only hold the **N** most recently created profiles.\r\n\r\nI still prefer the approach with the Guava cache because you can still effectively achieve the same result. As new profiles are created they can be added to the cache. If you access a very old profile, one more recently created profile will be evicted from the cache and the old profile will be added to the cache since a user just requested it. I would argue this behavior is not only easier to implement since we are leveraging a library, but actually more desirable since it caches a profile based on when it is used, not when it was created.\r\n\r\nIf you still disagree with using the Guava cache. I agree with your proposal of moving your cache into a separate class. I think you should also add some unit tests for the cache to verify that it works as expected. The unit tests will also make maintaining and enhancing the class easier for future developers.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/387873929/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/387879455","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1241#issuecomment-387879455","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1241","id":387879455,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4Nzg3OTQ1NQ==","user":{"login":"sohami","id":22159459,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTU5NDU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22159459?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohami","html_url":"https://github.com/sohami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-09T21:21:30Z","updated_at":"2018-05-09T21:21:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"1 minor comment related to unused function.
