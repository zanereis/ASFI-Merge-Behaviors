@ahutsunshine \r\n\r\nI import `SparkSuiteBase` instead of spark-testing-base jar because of  spark-testing-base jar is not compatible with some spark versions.\r\n\r\nSparkSuiteBase is mainly the same with SharedSparkContext.All the tests share the same SparkContext in one test suite.User can use SparkSuiteBase in the same way with SharedSparkContext.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/griffin/blob/e9dda8b53aadfc127854a89ac797c761b95de92a/measure/src/test/scala/org/apache/griffin/measure/SparkSuiteBase.scala#L28\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/484f93e25506f84d1548504783be9ce940149bb7/core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/SharedSparkContext.scala#L24\r\n\r\nBut spark context may cache some RDD data in memory, so it needs more memory when running test case.The spark context will destroy and free the memory after all the tests is done in the test suite.\r\n
