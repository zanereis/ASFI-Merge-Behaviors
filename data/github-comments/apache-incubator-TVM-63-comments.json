This appears to be happening because the identity relations between `t4` and `tup1`, `t5` and `tup2`, and `t4` and `t5` are marked as \"resolved\" in the queue (because the identity relation function always returns true) even though `tup1` and `tup2` contain nested incomplete types.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways I can think of right now to fix this bug:\r\n1. During unification, have a child node mark the parent's relations as unresolved if the child is an IncompleteType and enqueue them again (probably will lead to unnecessarily running relations more than once, so hopefully there's a way to be smarter about it).\r\n2. Change the identity relation to return false if there are nested incomplete types (not sure this is correct)\r\n\r\nEdit: Figured out another potential issue. In the case of `Unify(?a, Tuple(?b, ?c))`, `?b` and `?c` are not being marked as children of `?a`, i.e., updates to `?b` and `?c` are not causing updates to `?a`'s relations. I will investigate this too.\r\n\r\nEdit2: Additionally, if we have a type `Tuple(?a, ?b)` and update `?a` and `?b`, the solver's `Resolve()` will still resolve `Tuple(?a, ?b)` as `Tuple(?a, ?b)`, so perhaps `Resolve()` needs to have a visitor too.\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef test_backward_solving_after_child_update():\r\n    solver = make_solver()\r\n\r\n    tensor1 = relay.ty.TensorType((10, 20),

This looks good in the general direction, there are a few high-level points that I think we can discuss:\r\n\r\n- The intrinsic attribute map and op map are mostly the same and maybe we want to share some data structure\r\n- It is not too scalable to put everything as the member of the attribute, instead, maybe we can consider using additional attributes set_attr by default.\r\n- We do not need string(target) to function map, we can directly encode target name in the intrinsic name(e.g. tvm.intrin.cce.copy)\r\n- We don;t need to use any, instead use the same PackedFunc and TVMRetValue will automatically enable registrations in python
