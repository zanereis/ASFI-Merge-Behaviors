So, existing schema provider will stay as is w/o much changes and is meant only for spark engine. and all classes inheriting from SchemaProvider abstract class does not need any changes.\r\n> If we want to we can introduce a similar class for each engine.\r\n> \r\n> But trying to see how much of a benefit we get out of it.\r\n> Do you know how many existing schema provider implementations does not have any dependency to any of spark entities. If yes, we might benefit a lot. If not, we might have to fix most of them to make it generic so that flink and java can re-use them.\r\n> \r\n> So, is the intent to use existing schema provider impls for flink and java as well?

But this payload involves fetching previous record and merging with incoming one. So, might as well end up using COW for simplicity and since MOR is mainly used to shave off some latency during writes. \r\nOpen to hear your thoughts.
