The [shared net](https://github.com/loofahcus/mxnet/blob/parallel_actor_critic/example/reinforcement-learning/parallel_actor_critic/model.py#L18) uses MLP instead of CNN, since [Atari8080Preprocessor](https://github.com/loofahcus/mxnet/blob/parallel_actor_critic/example/reinforcement-learning/parallel_actor_critic/envs.py#L4) simplifies the observation into “binary image”, which leads to fast learning, and so it may not fit other games. Since this implementation focuses on right implementation of network structure for actor-critic, it's not a big deal.\r\n\r\nBy the way, in my opinion, the biggest difference between **A3C** and **Parallel Actor Critic** may lie in the rate of convergence, A3C may benefit from its hogwild learning
