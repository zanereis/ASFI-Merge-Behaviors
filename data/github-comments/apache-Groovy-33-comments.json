I would suggest creating a new `org.codehaus.groovy.tools.GrapeUtilTest` class (preferred) or add some test(s) to `groovy.grape.GrapeIvyTest`.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the _legal format_, we defer to formats support by Ivy and Gradle/Maven.\r\nIvy format is captured here (but not related to the issues you found):\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/groovy/blob/master/src/main/java/groovy/grape/GrabAnnotationTransformation.java#L111\r\n\r\nFor Gradle/Maven, we refer back to Gradle doco as mentioned here (it would have possibly been better if we had moved this into that utility method):\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/groovy/blob/master/src/main/java/groovy/grape/GrabAnnotationTransformation.java#L563\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, that link is outdated and should point to either the original:\r\nhttps://docs.gradle.org/3.5.1/userguide/dependency_management.html#sec:how_to_declare_your_dependencies\r\nOr something newer

If you gave some examples, I might be able to provide reasoning.  The purpose of the draft was to discuss these items rather than just be dismissive.\r\n\r\nWhat is the concern with leveraging `TraceClassVisitor` which is provided instead of maintaining `LoggableClassVisitor` which tries to do the same job and I've found many problems with the flushing and the multiple instance creation?\r\n\r\nIf you are referencing the replacement of `isPostJDK5()`, then my raised concerns earlier are that \"is post\" is not the correct semantic.  It is really \"is at least\" and the use if `isAtLeast(targetBytecode,JDK5)` is conveys that semantic and does not require a new public API method for every Java release, which are coming every 6 months now, not every few years.  Again, this is demonstrated for discussion purposes.  It is not a must have.\r\n\r\nI disagree with lifting one-time use values up to the top of a class file.  I disagree with adding public API for something that *might* be useful but has no track record of need.

The suggested external behavior seems okay and I would add 'metaClass' as an additional case to test for.\r\n\r\nWhat worries me is the change in behavior for closures. The following currently passes:\r\n```\r\nclass Foo {\r\n    @Delegate Map m = [:]\r\n    def x = 4\r\n    protected y = 5\r\n    private z = 6\r\n    void method() {\r\n        def w = 3\r\n        assert 3 == { -> w }()\r\n        assert null == { -> x }()\r\n        assert null == { -> y }()\r\n        assert null == { -> z }()\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Bar {\r\n    def x = 4\r\n    protected y = 5\r\n    private z = 6\r\n    void method() {\r\n        def w = 3\r\n        assert 3 == { -> w }()\r\n        assert 4 == { -> x }()\r\n        assert 5 == { -> y }()\r\n        assert 6 == { -> z }()\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nnew Foo().method()\r\nnew Bar().method()\r\n```\r\nThis exhibits the \"potentially strange\" map takes precedence behavior but is at least consistent across `x`, `y`, and `z`.\r\nAfter the change, just the `x` behavior has altered precedence.\r\n\r\nMy suspicion is that what you have is close but needs some more work. I am also thinking we might need to define a special Map metaclass that would provide back the old behavior - again it would be good to align get/set even for that case. Users relying on the old behavior could manually apply that metaclass. I would regard this as a legacy compatibility mechanism rather than something we would recommend is used for new development.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/1009908404/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/1010106711","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/1674#issuecomment-1010106711","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/1674","id":1010106711,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAgdnis48NQFX","user":{"login":"eric-milles","id":18193802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTkzODAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18193802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-milles","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-milles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-milles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-milles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-milles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-milles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-milles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-milles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-milles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-milles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-milles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-11T15:59:52Z","updated_at":"2022-01-11T15:59:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"It was intended to make this read the property and not from the map:\r\n```groovy\r\nclass C {\r\n    @Delegate Map m = [:]\r\n    def x = 4\r\n    public y = 5\r\n    void method() {\r\n        def v = 3\r\n        assert 3 == { -> v }()\r\n        assert 4 == { -> x }() // previously preferred map lookup\r\n        assert 5 == { -> y }() // previously preferred map lookup\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI thought the first step would be to have read of `public` field or accessor gain precedence over map lookup.  For write it already includes `public` and `protected`.  I took the cautions approach by dealing with `public` first and leaving `protected` as-is.\r\n\r\nThe idea here is that if you created a type that implements `Map` but then added public API, that API should take precedence over the general map property mechanism.\r\n\r\nFor legacy support, any code may replace `name` with `get('name')` to stick with the

I chose to hold back from ASM 9 to lower the risk.  There has not been a Groovy 2.5 release since then, so there is no release that includes Java 15 target support (aka ASM 8) yet.  2.5.16 was my goal for that.\r\n\r\n> Don't make the scope bigger than what I clearly described on Jira\r\n\r\nI'm trying to limit the scope of this change.  Adding the `JDK16`, etc. constants and mappings in `JDK_TO_BYTECODE_VERSION_MAP` communicates that the compiler supports targeting those class versions.  Increasing the ASM version but leaving the highest target version at JDK15 allows reading newer class files but not writing the newer versions.  This is how we don't get into the business of having to work out Java 16+ bugs on the Groovy 2.5
