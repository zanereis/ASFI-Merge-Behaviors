Native C++ implementation of both classes are using python static methods \"auto_scheduler.local_builder.build\" and \"auto_scheduler.local_runner.run\" respectively. Both python functions are blocking, that is wait until all task in internal ThreadPool are finished. There are no state shared between runs, all treads started at the begin of python build/run functions will be joined at the end. The native implementation of builder/runner doesn't retain any python resources.\r\n\r\n**The problem 1**: Because of blocking nature of this API, \"Run\" step will starts only after \"Build\" step completion. Host compiles kernels - device awaits, device executes kernels - host waits. Device and host are separate devices and may works in parallel. Build and Run steps should be overlapped. \r\n\r\n**The problem 2**: By design, the tuning round tasks are splitter into batches. At the end of batch processing it has strong sync point/barrier, wait until all task in batch are completed (limitation of sync nature of API). In case of tasks time imbalance all workers spend time in idle state.    \r\n\r\n**The goal**: To make Build and Run methods asynchronous (non blocking). The Builder/Runner instance incapsulate some fixed pool of workers and each Build/Run method just submit task to execute without waiting of completion. The synchronisation happens only once at the end of tuning round method. \r\n\r\n**My suggestion for design changes**:\r\n* Make methods Build and Run async with callback mechanics. The completion callback will be called when one atomic task is completed. \r\n```cpp\r\nBuild(...)  -> SubmitToBuild(... , callback);\r\nRun(...) -> SubmitToRun(... , callback);\r\n\r\n// Usage example before\r\nfor (auto input : input_collection)\r\n  build_result_collection.push_back(builder->Build(input));\r\nfor (auto build_result : build_result_collection)\r\n  run_result_collection.pushback(runner->Run(build_result));\r\n\r\n// Usage example after\r\nfor (auto input : input_collection) {\r\n  builder->SubmitToBuild(input, [](auto build_result) {\r\n    runner->SubmitToRun(build_result, [](auto run_result) {\r\n      run_result_collection.pushback(run_result);\r\n    });\r\n  });\r\n  cv.wait(run_result_collection.size() == input_collection.size())\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWorker pool is attached for builder/runner object and reused for all SubmitToBuild/SubmitToRun calls.\r\n\r\n* Make workers ThreadPool as Builder/Runner resources. One builder instance uses single instance of ThreadPool. Release of Builder object will lead of release of worker ThreadPool. There is a no a convenient way to attach regular python object to native C++ implementation of FFI based objects. The only way I found in TVM sources is next:\r\n  - Create python object\r\n  - Capture this object into some python function\r\n  - Wrap this function into PackedFunction\r\n  - Hold this PackedFunction instance as a field in native class \r\n\r\n  That's why I added `PackedFunc submit_func` field instead of simple string with function name. It should hold worker TreadPool object. If you know a more proper way to do that please advise me.\r\n\r\n* Synchronisation and task dependency solving are implemented on `ProgramMeasurer` level. It uses SubmitToBuild/SubmitToRun in a way it wants. It may simulate blocking behaviour like before. May add additional barriers. Or just submit all existing task to executors as a single scope and wait it completion. The special flag `async_mode` manages sync(old)/async behaviour of ProgramMeasurer.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/822442102/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/822520669","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7875#issuecomment-822520669","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7875","id":822520669,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyMjUyMDY2OQ==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-19T14:40:53Z","updated_at":"2021-04-19T15:00:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks @apeskov .

Since the build time of each schedule is similar, the bottleneck is definitiely the runtime measurement.

They are in apps/stm32/ project directory, which is the X-Cube derived directory. Are you thinking of another place or renaming and adding the STM X-Cube to the name ?\r\nThere are also a few .py files in the python/tvm/contrib/stm32 directory that allow connecting to STM32 via the ST Link, which indeed use the pyserial package. I thought this functionality is generic enough and interesting enough for the STM32 users to put it together with the code emitter. If you feel these files belong to the X-Cube project, I can move them to the apps/stm32 or whichever place you'd suggest.\r\n\r\n> here I think I see tests (in tests/micro) for the logic in python/tvm/contrib/stm32 and some of src/runtime/stm32\r\n> right now our test strategy for TVM CI is to test only with virtualization (e.g. qemu or other emulators) on publicly available cloud hardware. so i think it would be hard to test logic such as the usb validation driver inside the TVM CI.\r\n\r\nThis micro/stm32 test verifies only the stm32/code emitter and the runtime/stm32,. It does not test the STLink or X-Cube project logic - no board necessary. It runs in the x86 standard environment.\r\n\r\n> finally, I should say that out of necessity we do have some of this with microTVM (some RPC layers and pyserial code), but these are effectively ports of the official TVM RPC protocol and we test as much as possible against a virtual e.g. QEMU as well as have a defined path to testing with real hardware. what i don't know is whether e.g. the board-specific logic lives in another repo--if so, i wonder whether it would be easier to test that code in that repository.\r\n\r\nThere is no problem to moving the ST-Link logic to the X-Cube project apps/stm32 directory.\r\nThe application there is not run with the CI tests because a board would be necessary, this application is there as a demo for STM32 developers on how to use TVM with the HW board. \r\n\r\nSo, I would follow your lead here - please suggest how I could re-arrange the apps/stm32 and contrib/stm32 files to be more in line with the micro.\r\n\r\nArthur\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/823447885/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/823469024","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7858#issuecomment-823469024","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7858","id":823469024,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyMzQ2OTAyNA==","user":{"login":"areusch","id":532957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/532957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch","html_url":"https://github.com/areusch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-20T17:32:32Z","updated_at":"2021-04-20T17:32:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"cc @jroesch -- I think Jared is updating the images, but there is some challenge with GPU drivers right now that is blocking us.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/823469024/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/823497027","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7742#issuecomment-823497027","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7742","id":823497027,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyMzQ5NzAyNw==","user":{"login":"areusch","id":532957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/532957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch","html_url":"https://github.com/areusch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-20T18:13:54Z","updated_at":"2021-04-20T18:13:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@stoa I think it depends how you plan to distribute support for targeting STM32 processors. do you plan to just include this in the STM X-Cube AI downloadable package, or is the intent to allow using STM32 processors with TVM directly, without the need to download the package from your site? if the latter, it'd help me to understand a bit more about your goal.

\r\nIt would be difficult to use the STM32  without the need to download any package from our site - you need at least the BSP, and the HAL helps a lot. This would be the minimum to be reasonable.\r\nWe plan to supply the X-Cube with TVM integrated with it. It is easier to generate a project using the X-Cube. Once the project with the board configuration is generated, we can work with it outside of the Cube, if desired. For example, I usually do this  - I am traditionally a command line person.\r\n\r\nThe apps/stm32 demo application is a X-Cube generated project (board configuration) where we added our application for Performance Measurement and Validation of ML models. The models are compiled by TVM. I thought it is a good idea to have such a demo bundled with the TVM source base, but you are right - there is still a need to download some basic board support packages. However, notice that this demo application should not add to the CI complexity since it is not part of the CI, just an application note if you wish.\r\nIf you believe it is better - we can set this application up separately from TVM. Perhaps, there are other applications that are setup in this way ?

I need to explain more is in our case, we use compute to define the HW intrinsic, it is may as the same as Operators, such as element-wise. But it is not the same compute (I mean the same addresses of all nodes), instead of the concept. :)\r\n\r\nFor example, an Add op has 4 dims (i0, i1, i2, i3) and the three innermost (i1, i2, i3) axes will be split, then after reorder, the region of the inner axes (i1.i, i2.i, i3.i) will be tensorized to an Intrin_Add. In this situation, Add op and the Intrin_Add share the compute.\r\n\r\nSo, in the reusing case, it is more natural to `call_extern`, I think.
