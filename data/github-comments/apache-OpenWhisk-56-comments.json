Maybe `web_export`? (do we CamelCase?)\r\n* I'm a concerned with the monumental work that comes with trying to encode an HTTP request into JSON fields (passed to the action), and interpreting a JSON object as an HTTP response. I'm afraid that conventions can only ever get us the easy cases, and that soon enough we'll be maintaining and documenting dozens of them. Could we instead resort to some externally documented schema? E.g. HAR has subsections for [requests](http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/har-12-spec/#request) and [responses](http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/har-12-spec/#response), but there may also be other suitable formats. Within actions, I'd expect that we will rapidly support translating these encoded objects into user-friendly libraries (e.g. `request`).\r\n* With the comment above in mind, I would be in favor of simplifying the implementation and removing path projection (the path would be one of the components passed to the action, which can decide how to handle it).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/273474747/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/273480877","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/1715#issuecomment-273480877","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1715","id":273480877,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MzQ4MDg3Nw==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-18T13:55:31Z","updated_at":"2017-01-18T15:40:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"It's fair to change the annotation.

Much of the work in place is to enable the web based activation. For that and for making standard actions accessible without buying into http request/response, the projection is still useful. That said as you noticed the action does receive the unmatched parts and can decide how to respond anyway. This I posit makes for a gentler migration for actions. For moving express apps the counter is likely true and your points are well taken. \r\n\r\nFor the http bits what I supported is header setting and nothing else.

In the document, guide user to manually change the ip address in ```ansible/environment/local/hosts```\r\n2. Properly update the default IP\r\n   (But I doubt there exists all-round default ip for mac and linux.)\r\n\r\n### 2. Enabling Docker remote API\r\nDocker remote API is not enabled by default in Docker for Mac.\r\n\r\n**Options**\r\n1. In the document, guide user to manually run socat container or do other workaround.\r\n2. Create the ansible step for this issue.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to make just guide for this issue.\r\nThere could be many workaround for this.\r\nI think it will be better to give users a choice. \r\n\r\n### ETC\r\n\r\nIf there is no reason not to add apigateway.yml in the guide, I will include this step in the guide.(including existing guides)\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/273703040/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/273704417","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/1431#issuecomment-273704417","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1431","id":273704417,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MzcwNDQxNw==","user":{"login":"style95","id":3447251,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDcyNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3447251?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95","html_url":"https://github.com/style95","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-19T07:50:27Z","updated_at":"2017-01-19T07:50:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"One

could address the first issue with regard to ip address.\r\n\r\nThe workaround is as follow.\r\n\r\nI added alias for loopback interface.\r\n```\r\nsudo ifconfig lo0 alias 172.17.0.1/24\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd it magically works as expected : )\r\n\r\n\r\nIn details, basically 172.17.0.1(gateway) is osx host machine in container side.\r\nSo all the network traffic will be forwarded to host machine via 172.17.0.1 as a gateway.\r\nAnd it will go out further to the internet via hosts` physical network interface.\r\n\r\nThe problem was host did not recognize 172.17.0.1 as its local network ip.\r\nIf container is trying to connect to other container via 172.17.0.1, host does not accept this request and all the containers are not reachable to each other.\r\n\r\nSo I added 172.17.0.1 as alias for loopback address and finally it works.\r\nNow we can seamlessly deploy openwhisk with current local inventory file in Docker for Mac environment also. \r\n\r\nYou can
