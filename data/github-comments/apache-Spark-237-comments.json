also noticed that it will be suffering when comparing against 0.0.

However, people may just want to write unittest using relative error for even comparing those small numbers. So I purpose the following APIs.\n`a ~== b +- eps` for relative error, and when a or b near zero, let's say 1e-15, it falls back to absolute error.\n`a === b +- eps` which is already in scalatest 2.0

Replaced doctests with standalone tests\n2. Fixed converter for converting BytesWritables and added read/write tests for BytesWritable and byte arrays\n3. Added HBase and Cassandra output format and converter examples\n4. I used to inspect array element types and try to convert Object[] to array of primitive types whenever possible (so that they get pickled to Python arrays, whereas Object[] gets pickled to Python tuples). But I removed that code, since I can't determine element types for empty arrays. Users have to supply custom converters if they want Java arrays to appear as Python arrays (if they know their array types a priori).\n5. No out-of-box support for reading/writing arrays, since ArrayWritable itself doesn't have a no-arg constructor for creating an empty instance upon deserializing. Users need to provide ArrayWritable subtypes. Custom converters for converting arrays to suitable ArrayWritable subtypes are also needed when writing. When reading, the default converter will convert any custom ArrayWritable subtypes to Object[] and they get pickled to Python tuples.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49810291/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49810818","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1338#issuecomment-49810818","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1338","id":49810818,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5ODEwODE4","user":{"login":"kanzhang","id":940009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0MDAwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/940009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kanzhang","html_url":"https://github.com/kanzhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kanzhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kanzhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kanzhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kanzhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kanzhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kanzhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kanzhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kanzhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kanzhang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-22T22:35:00Z","updated_at":"2014-07-22T22:35:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@pwendell I renamed file HBaseConverter.scala to HBaseConverters.scala.
