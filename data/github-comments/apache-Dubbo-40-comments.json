From dubbo's user doc, the group is designed to distinguish the different impls as you planned to give the support here, see http://dubbo.apache.org/books/dubbo-user-book/demos/service-group.html. That is, you could always look up the desired ReferenceBean with the given id, that means `DynamicReferenceService` is unnecessary\r\n\r\n```java\r\n<dubbo:reference id=\"feedbackIndexService\" group=\"feedback\" interface=\"com.xxx.IndexService\" />\r\n<dubbo:reference id=\"memberIndexService\" group=\"member\" interface=\"com.xxx.IndexService\" />\r\n``` \r\n\r\n2. I am not convinced that RefConf should be introduced, since it looks very familiar with com.alibaba.dubbo.config.ReferenceConfig#ReferenceConfig(com.alibaba.dubbo.config.annotation.Reference)\r\n3. com.alibaba.dubbo.config.spring.AnnotationBean is deprecated, we should not add more functionality on this class\r\n4. some minor issues including:\r\n    * missing license header\r\n    * comments in Chinese\r\n    * author info should be removed\r\n\r\nFeel free to reopen and let's discuss further if appropriated.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/379529154/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/379529175","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/1545#issuecomment-379529175","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1545","id":379529175,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3OTUyOTE3NQ==","user":{"login":"ralf0131","id":4397305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTczMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4397305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131","html_url":"https://github.com/ralf0131","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-08T07:53:45Z","updated_at":"2018-04-08T07:53:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi, welcome!\r\n\r\nWould you please update the title and description using English?

multi-branch api dependent version management issues\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the official recommendation, the public api project is extracted between the service provider and the service consumer. Both the service consumer and the service provider rely on this api project. When the dubbo-based microservice architecture is used, services are inevitably invoked. The problem that arises is that engineering depends on multiple api projects. We use jenkins to use all the api poll scm detection code changes when the API is automatically packaged to the internal network nexus PW.\r\nAll service providers and consumers can rely on these api projects. When teams work together, it is inevitable to pull multiple branches for parallel development. At this point how to do API version dependency management?\r\nAssuming that there are branch api and rel two branches of the api may be modified, this time if the dev and rel branch api version number should not be distinguished, two branch api set a different version number, then dev / rel are Setting the poll scm to auto-negotiate nexus will inevitably lead to manual maintenance of the version number when the code is merged.

way?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/379956932/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/379959237","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/1548#issuecomment-379959237","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1548","id":379959237,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3OTk1OTIzNw==","user":{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-10T03:05:39Z","updated_at":"2018-04-10T03:05:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"There's
