Consequently, each term in the above expression will be zero *except* the condition matching the value of x. So if x = 1, then the result of that operation is: `10 * 0 + -4.2 * 1 + 14 * 0 = -4.2`.\r\n\r\nSame of course works if you're using mxnet ndarrays.\r\n\r\nYou might need broadcast_mul if you're working over a batch rather than the `*` operator.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/298980299/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/299006407","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/6000#issuecomment-299006407","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/6000","id":299006407,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5OTAwNjQwNw==","user":{"login":"jiayue666","id":26607051,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjA3MDUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26607051?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiayue666","html_url":"https://github.com/jiayue666","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiayue666/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiayue666/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiayue666/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiayue666/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiayue666/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiayue666/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiayue666/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiayue666/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiayue666/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-03T19:08:57Z","updated_at":"2017-05-03T19:08:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I can document 2-5.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/299006407/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/299009179","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/6000#issuecomment-299009179","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/6000","id":299009179,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5OTAwOTE3OQ==","user":{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-03T19:20:08Z","updated_at":"2017-05-03T19:35:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I can share 130-145 with @moontails.
