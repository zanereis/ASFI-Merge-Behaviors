Or is each try just a Job? Do we store the start dates somewhere?\r\n\r\n@ashb Each task run gets recorded in TaskInstance and `try_number` is a property of a task run. Each try will increase the `try_number` of that particular task instance. TaskInstance table uses `dag_id`, `task_id`, `execution_date` as its primary key. The log filename ensures log corresponds to each task try is unique and immutable. When `read()` is called, it will use the primary keys and the `try_number` to locate the log for each try. Hope this helps! \r\n\r\n@bolkedebruin We actually had a conversation regarding whether to use try number or start date. Some concerns with using start date are 1) the timestamp is not necessarily unique, while try_number is monotonically increasing  2) we will need extra information to look up the log for each try. I am wondering why start date is better here?
