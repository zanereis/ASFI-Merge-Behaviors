All the steps and tricks are listed below (except for ones described in [the instruction](http://mxnet.io/get_started/setup.html#installing-mxnet-on-a-gpu)):\n1. Download the master branch zip file and pre-built package of THE SAME date. Now it is 20160531 - date of the latest stable release. So I have \"mxnet-20160531.zip\" and \"20160531_win10_x64_gpu\".7z files to work. If you have one of them newer you could run into troubles.\n2. Place libmxnet.dll not in the \"nocudnn/lib\" directory but just in \"libs\" directory with other 11 libraries.\n3. Install Rtools if you didn't it before. If you have Rtools 3.3 or 3.4 downgrade to Rtools 3.2. I personally totaly removed Rtools 3.4 and install Rtools 3.2 from scratch.\n4. Add to the system PATH not only R itself but Rtools as well. For me it is \"C:\\Rtools\\bin\" and \"C:\\Rtools\\gcc-4.6.3\\bin\". You can do it with installation of Rtools but it is not set by default.\n5. Correct Makeconf file at \"%R_HOME%\\etc\\x64\" if you have there new compiler (not gcc-4.6.3) written. I edited 19 and 20 lines so I have now\n   \n   > BINPREF ?= C:/Rtools/gcc-4.6.3/bin/\n   > COMPILED_BY = gcc-4.6.3\n6. Run `R CMD INSTALL --no-multiarch R-package` at least!\n\nUPD. 7. If you have (unsuccesfull) buildings before: remove \"R-package\" directory and repeat all the steps listed in the instruction and above. The reason is some files are already builded in the wrong way (executor.o etc.) and they are not rebuilded by default. Maybe you can just remove all this wrongly builded files but I'm not sure which files to remove and which not.\n\nIt helped me so it can help you.\nNow I should try how (and if) MXNet works...\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/260743115/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/260751541","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/3827#issuecomment-260751541","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/3827","id":260751541,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MDc1MTU0MQ==","user":{"login":"leopd","id":193183,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzE4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/193183?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leopd","html_url":"https://github.com/leopd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leopd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leopd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leopd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leopd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leopd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leopd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leopd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leopd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leopd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-15T20:04:33Z","updated_at":"2016-11-15T20:04:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"How can I see the linter errors?
