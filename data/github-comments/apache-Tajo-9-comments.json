For it, I've improved GlobalPlanner to have some rewrite engine, and I changed TajoTestingCluster to inject additional rewrite rules to check the equality. As a result, I added two rewrite rules:\n- GlobalPlanEqualityTester\n- LogicalPlanEqualityTester\n\nThese equality tests also finds out additional bugs which have not been known. In this patch, I fixed them all. They are usually related to equality and clone of LogicalNode and EvalNode.\n\nAlso, while I'm working on it, I corrected some wrong or bad names as follow:\n- Rename BasicLogicalPlanVisitor::visitDistinct to visitDistinctGroupby\n- Rename RelationNode::getTableSchema to getLogicalSchema\n- Rename DistingtGroupbyNode::getGroupByNodes to getSubPlans\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/68246166/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/68247429","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/322#issuecomment-68247429","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/322","id":68247429,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4MjQ3NDI5","user":{"login":"hyunsik","id":225941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/225941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik","html_url":"https://github.com/hyunsik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-29T10:42:34Z","updated_at":"2014-12-29T10:42:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@jihoonson Thank you for your comment.

I tested it with `asc` as well as `desc`. But, it works well in both cases. Is it just a hint?\n\nIn addition, such a physical property is fragile due to following reasons:\n- It is hard for users to ensure the table properties.\n- INSERT (OVERWRITE) INTO AS SELECT can change the physical properties.\n\nHow do you think about them?

On physical properties: When creating a BST index, the index keys are sorted. The sort specifications in the `CREATE INDEX` statement are used to specify the sort order of index keys. Maybe, we can use this feature for performance boost of some other operations such as merge sort or sort-merge join. \n   Since the sort specifications represent the sort order of index keys in a newly created index, I think that users can specify their preferred sort specifications which will be beneficial for future queries. \n2. On the index maintenance issue: If a base table is changed, every index created on that table must be updated. To handle this problem, we need to introduce a new feature, such as the trigger of database systems. However, since this will induce a huge amount of work, it would be better to proceed in another issue. Until that, we may leave the index maintenance problem to users. IMHO, since this feature is still experimental, it would be enough.\n3. On showing index information: you can see information about the created indexes when executing the `\\d [tablename]` command. Of course, we need to show more detailed information in future. I'll add this to our documentation, too.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/68331921/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/68336860","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/322#issuecomment-68336860","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/322","id":68336860,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4MzM2ODYw","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-30T07:47:07Z","updated_at":"2014-12-30T07:47:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Great work!\nThis patch contains simple but effective changes.\nI left some comments.\nPlease consider them.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/68336860/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/68346334","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/322#issuecomment-68346334","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/322","id":68346334,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4MzQ2MzM0","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-30T10:34:30Z","updated_at":"2014-12-30T10:34:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1\nThanks for awesome work!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/68346334/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/68353868","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/322#issuecomment-68353868","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/322","id":68353868,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4MzUzODY4","user":{"login":"hyunsik","id":225941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/225941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik","html_url":"https://github.com/hyunsik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-30T12:49:54Z","updated_at":"2014-12-30T12:49:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I also simplified Schema::getColumnId().
