MXNet already support YARN and I think spark integration is one the plan.\n\nOne key difference between the project you mentioned here is. While caffe style model follows a config and run strategy, which is fine for pre-defined CNN. MXNet focuses on maximum customization via hybrid declarative and imperative API.\n\nHere are some examples I believe which is easier in mxnet:\n- Use scala to define customized optimization algorithm that runs on GPU\n- Fully take advantage of the scala NDArray API, so you can do other strange stuffs besides data parallel training of a model.\n\nThis being said, the goal of mxnet is being portable, this should include being able to easily ported to other projects, as well as being able to port to major platforms.
