It's actually good to have a PR per JIRA. However, personally I think, we can do one PR, and mark all other JIRAs we \"resolved by\"... It's just single line fixes anyway.\r\n\r\n@enothereska @guozhangwang @dguy

thing to note that, this is not introduced in this PR but: each time we call `readKeyValues` as the `condition` we are creating a new consumer with the given consumer configs, and the `condition` is called multiple times. So we are effectively relying on the consumer config to have `ENABLE_AUTO_COMMIT_CONFIG` turned on so that when the consumer is closing each time within the `readKeyValues` it will commit offset so it will not duplicate fetching.\r\n\r\nI think we can do a follow up PR for fixing the `waitUntilMinXXXRecordsReceived` functions in a way that \r\n\r\n1) it only requires the passed consumer config to contain bootstrap servers and key-value serdes; while all other configs will be overridden internally that \"reset\" is earliest, and \"auto commit\" is turned on, etc.\r\n2) we will re-use a single consumer across multiple calls of `readKeyValues` / `readValues` so we do not need to create a new one on each call.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/297515665/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/297516491","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2920#issuecomment-297516491","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2920","id":297516491,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NzUxNjQ5MQ==","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-26T19:29:25Z","updated_at":"2017-04-26T19:29:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@original-brownbear
