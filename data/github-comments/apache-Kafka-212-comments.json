I have added a check to two existing tests, one for secure acls and another for insecure. There was an issue with `controller_epoch` - it was being created in `KafkaController` without any ACLs even though it is listed as a secure path in `ZkUtils`. I think it was an oversight and fixed it, but it will be good if you can check, just in case it was deliberate. Since the migrator tool does add ACL to it, the change shouldn't cause any issues.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/293660103/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/293674875","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2845#issuecomment-293674875","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2845","id":293674875,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MzY3NDg3NQ==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-12T18:57:51Z","updated_at":"2017-04-12T18:57:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer

for the review @ijuma!\r\n\r\nFor some context. The main changes for the producer are in `Sender` and in `TransactionState`. The `TransactionState` class has nearly all the code for handling transactions. \r\n\r\nEssentially, the producer continues to have a single background thread it uses to send requests. The main difference is that transactional RPCs have the highest priority: if there is any such request waiting to be sent or in flight, no `ProduceRequest`s are sent. \r\n\r\nThe `TransactionState` maintains a queue of Transactional requests, ordered by priority. Some requests like `FindCoordinator` must always be sent first. Also `EndTxn` must always go last, etc. This class also manages chaining requests: so if we need to send to a coordinator, but don't have a coordinator yet, it will put the `FindCoordinator` request at the head of the queue. \r\n\r\nThe `TransactionsTest` has all the tests for the new flows.\r\n\r\nOn the consumer side, things are much simpler. All the main logic is in the `Fetcher`  in the `PartitionRecords` sub class. Here we decide whether to drop batches based on the contents of the abort index received in the fetch request. \r\n\r\nThe `FetcherTest` has new test cases for the consumer side fetcher changes.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/294057663/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/294061201","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2837#issuecomment-294061201","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2837","id":294061201,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NDA2MTIwMQ==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-14T01:15:28Z","updated_at":"2017-04-14T01:15:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer
