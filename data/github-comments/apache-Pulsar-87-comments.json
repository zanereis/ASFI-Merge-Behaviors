A non-partitioned topic is created in `internalCreateSubscription`, but functions as a temporary topic from which a subscription could be created. So if we created a non-partitioned PersistentTopic outside of this method, what would we do with it?\r\n\r\nCurrently the default behavior is a non-partitioned topic automatically created when a consumer subscribe or a publisher publishes a message. With you previous change, we disable this auto-creation. so the endpoint is the only way to create the non-partitioned topic. If a topic is created by the rest endpoint, when consumer/publisher connect, they will be realizing that the topic has been created. they will continue consuming or publishing messages.\r\n\r\n> I remember that `createPartitionedTopic` needed to be improved. I noticed that there is a precondition which prevents the number of partitions from being created to be less than two. So my understanding here is that we should remove this condition (i.e. allow the creation of a topic with no partitions) ?\r\n\r\nI think that should be a different pull request and a separated discussion. Changing the behavior of creating partitioned topic (e.g. allow creating a partitioned topic with only 1 partition) should be discussed at dev@ mailing list. It should be done via a PIP, since it is a user facing behavior change though.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/465539620/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/465547526","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/3607#issuecomment-465547526","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/3607","id":465547526,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NTU0NzUyNg==","user":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-20T12:06:12Z","updated_at":"2019-02-20T12:06:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"run

this as your own bundle. We're starting to hit a point where the PMC and committers are struggling to keep up in terms of expertise with the diversity of thing being offered for official inclusion.

* seeking by earliest / latest can just seek on all partitions. \r\n\r\nAgree. It doesn't make sense not to support earliest/latest... \r\n\r\n> 2\\. seeking by messageId is also doable. because messageId provides partition id.\r\n\r\nIf the seek operation only affects the cursor in one partition, it might become confusing to a user, since it's a different behavior from the above. \r\n\r\nIn general, I'm not a big fan of seek by message id on the consumer interface, since the purpose of `Consumer` should be that the reading position is \"managed\" by the system. If an application wants to position to a particular message id, it's more of manual handling and maybe `Reader` is a better option there.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/465903549/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/465904577","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/3644#issuecomment-465904577","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/3644","id":465904577,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NTkwNDU3Nw==","user":{"login":"merlimat","id":62500,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat","html_url":"https://github.com/merlimat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-21T08:18:56Z","updated_at":"2019-02-21T08:18:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":">
