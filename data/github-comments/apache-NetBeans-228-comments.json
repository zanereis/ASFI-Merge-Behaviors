However, I think that the application behavior should be consistent with the user's expectations. If I want to delete the project, I know what I'm doing. A \"typical\" behavior should be offered as an option. I therefore suggest completely deleting references to the deleted project by checking a dedicated checkbox, normally not checked.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2500735530/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2500959517","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/7984#issuecomment-2500959517","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7984","id":2500959517,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6VEZ0d","user":{"login":"Chris2011","id":795658,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NTY1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/795658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011","html_url":"https://github.com/Chris2011","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-26T14:32:47Z","updated_at":"2024-11-26T14:32:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sure, but as I said this not fixes the FR request for me either.

By default, the production code should allow the management of session beans by the application server. as follows:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    @PersistenceContext(unitName = \"my_persistence_unit\")\r\n    private EntityManager em;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe solution to this problem is to change the template when creating beans from the template. For example, when creating a web application with maven and creating jsf page from entity, which causes the creation of JPA bean and CDI bean, the problem can be solved.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2502799903/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2503476308","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/7993#issuecomment-2503476308","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7993","id":2503476308,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6VOARU","user":{"login":"dbalek","id":16077464,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDc3NDY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16077464?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbalek","html_url":"https://github.com/dbalek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbalek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbalek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbalek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbalek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbalek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbalek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbalek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbalek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbalek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-27T10:15:58Z","updated_at":"2024-11-27T10:15:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> This may need a bit more, to avoid the `mainClass`/`mainFilePath` being re-computed in `NbLaunchRequestHandler`. \r\n\r\nFixed.
