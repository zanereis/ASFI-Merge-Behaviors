Even if we do add such a mechanism, I don't think it would make sense to send credentials with each task.  So I can't see any situation where constructing a UGI for each task would make sense.\n\nAll that said, I remember when dealing with a JT memory leak that there were some tricky ways that UGIs interact with the FileSystem cache.

He also agreed that moving it up makes more sense. So unless there is a reason not to move it up (like tasks are running as different users) I would prefer to do that.  Note we also need to move the one in ApplicationMaster up if that hasn't been done yet since I believe Patrick found that issue with localization.\n\nI do understand your concerns that if leave it as it is now and do the FileSystem.closeAllForUGI after the tasks run, if it does get shared between tasks and we close it then we close it for both tasks.  The only thing I can say is don't do it... Its really no different then if we move the doas up, we have to make sure the task code doesn't close the filesystem and cause issues for the entire executor.  Either way you have to be careful.  if we move it up we can actually share it and seems a bit less prone to error.\n\nAlso in response to @aarondav first concern, I don't really follow. You aren't getting any benefits from the cache now. Its specific to that task so no other tasks can use that cached version of the filesystem so it is causing extra overhead.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/41912162/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/41912194","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30#issuecomment-41912194","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30","id":41912194,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxOTEyMTk0","user":{"login":"tgravescs","id":4563792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjM3OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4563792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs","html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-01T14:02:21Z","updated_at":"2014-05-01T14:02:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the help @andrewor14 it almost appears to be a jar file size things.  if i unjar the assembly jar and remove just a little bit of stuff and jar it back up it seems to work.
