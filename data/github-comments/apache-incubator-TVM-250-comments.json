That would be great. Feel free to open a new topic categorized under Development > RFC on our [discuss forum](https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/). If you look in that [category](https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/c/development/rfc/8) you can see some examples of how people have titled and structured their RFCs. However, the process is fairly informal at this point.

It seems that this PR is changing the default both for the address the server binds to as well as the address a client would connect to. Am I getting that right?\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that on both Windows and Linux, binding a server to 0.0.0.0 is the correct thing to do, since it allows the server to listen on any address / any interface, which is necessary in order to accept external connections. Binding to localhost or 127.0.0.1 would only bind on the loopback interface (on Linux, anyway) only permitting local connection, but I don't think that is the correct default behavior.\r\n\r\nThe client address should, of course, be specified explicitly, either as 127.0.0.1 (or, equivalently, 'localhost') or explicitly when connecting to a remote address.

Do you mean add a C++ api like Set/GetAllocator, instead of register by name? I chose register by name because: 1. it makes code clean & neat. 2. There are other places using the same pattern in TVM, e.g. DeviceApiManger uses keys like \"device_api.gpu\"/\"device_api.cpu\".

This PR is wrong but there is still a problem with addresses which needs to be fixed. I will revert all of the current changes and submit new changes that correct the issues I am having on windows. I would close this PR and create a new one, but there is good discussion here that I would like to preserve.\r\n\r\nQuestion to you and @tqchen: Currently when we create the tracker we pass in the \"host\" address of 0.0.0.0 which is fine and the tracker has a property \"host\" which returns the \"host address\" of the tracker which is not fine. The tracker likely has multiple addresses, one for each of the network interfaces and returning the \"host address\" of the tracker is confusing, which of the multiple host addresses would a client connect to? The client is normally told explicitly via a command-line parameter which address to connect to. I would like to remove the \"host\" property of the tracker. Currently the tracker host property returns 0.0.0.0 which is not the address a client would use to connect to the tracker.\r\n\r\nWe also need to disambiguate the address of the tracker in the code, which uses `host` and `tracker_host` interchangeably.

Particularly, we have three points to discuss:\r\n- A1. Block names need to be unique. The reason is that the canonical way of retrieving a block is to use its name, i.e. `schedule.get_block(name)`. Without a unique name, we are unable to even retrieve a block, which makes scheduling almost impossible. (of course, it is possible to retrieve a block by the buffer it produces or via a statement, but it is not the canonical way)\r\n- A2. We need reserved names for the root block. I am kinda in favor of this idea too, because we do provide syntactic sugar to auto complete the root block with the name \"root\". This could help us eliminate possible name conflicts.\r\n- A3. Users could specify the names of newly created blocks/loops. Yes, it is doable when implementing schedule primitives.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/810515117/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/810521591","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7772#issuecomment-810521591","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7772","id":810521591,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxMDUyMTU5MQ==","user":{"login":"mdw-octoml","id":63477620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNDc3NjIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63477620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdw-octoml","html_url":"https://github.com/mdw-octoml","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdw-octoml/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdw-octoml/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdw-octoml/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdw-octoml/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdw-octoml/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdw-octoml/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdw-octoml/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdw-octoml/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdw-octoml/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-30T19:30:01Z","updated_at":"2021-03-30T19:30:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @gromero !
