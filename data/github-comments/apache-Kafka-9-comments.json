However ZkUtils is an \"object\" and its isSecure variable is initialized on first reference to ZkUtil. This means if the unit test runs in isolation (in a new JVM) it passes , however if it runs in the same JVM (default gradle behavior to reuse the same jvm for all test cases) as some other unit test depending on the order of execution one of the 2 test case will fail. I can think of 2 alternatives\n- Fork a new JVM for each test case. Obvious disadvantage of tests taking longer to run. On my machine it increased the test execution time by 54 seconds (Total time: 5 mins 27.038 secs instead of \n  Total time: 4 mins 21.574 secs).\n- Make isSecure a method that dynamically returns true or false and getAcls also dynamically. This has the obvious disadvantage of re parsing the jaas file on each zkUtil call that tries to write something to decide if zookeeper is secured or not which practically should not change in real production.\n\nI also explored if there is a way to reload an object instance but that just seems like an even worst heck. Let me know if you can think of any other less hecky option. \n\nYou can see the actual unit test https://github.com/Parth-Brahmbhatt/kafka/commit/ebedba5629e6253aac7976ed4a0fc1dbde5fffdd \n\nand the changes to build.gradle to make it spawn one jvm per unit test is https://github.com/Parth-Brahmbhatt/kafka/commit/7f5bba888350f0ae9d8d3878fa0e0016168c2ee5\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/137253721/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/137264374","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/183#issuecomment-137264374","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/183","id":137264374,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNzI2NDM3NA==","user":{"login":"eribeiro","id":116156,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjE1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116156?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eribeiro","html_url":"https://github.com/eribeiro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eribeiro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eribeiro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eribeiro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eribeiro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eribeiro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eribeiro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eribeiro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eribeiro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eribeiro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-02T22:36:14Z","updated_at":"2015-09-02T22:36:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @ijuma, good question.

I see a couple of options:\n1. Increase the timeout here/use a longer timeout for the first poll() so the broker has extra time to create the topic. It's possible we want to do this anyway because it may be too low for a join group cycle to complete with default settings if you have multiple consumers in the group. However, this is just a hack around the real issue, which is that consumer metadata lookup can block for a long time waiting for topic creation. Any code that might interact with a fresh cluster would need similar tweaking.\n2. Create the offsets topic proactively. It looks like right now it might only be created upon consumer metadata request. Is there a good reason we can't create it earlier? Then system tests like these could just wait until it's been created before trying to proceed (we can monitor the logs for the relevant output). It also probably provides a better out-of-the-box experience for users -- it's kind of weird to potentially have your first interaction with a cluster as a consumer potentially fail... On the other hand, this fix only works well for system tests because they would _know_ to monitor for that event; new users just running CLI commands wouldn't know about that, so it could still be a problem if the topic takes too long to create.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/137302426/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/137305082","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/179#issuecomment-137305082","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/179","id":137305082,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNzMwNTA4Mg==","user":{"login":"hachikuji","id":12502538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAyNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12502538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji","html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-03T02:38:23Z","updated_at":"2015-09-03T02:38:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ewencp I think @granders said he thought there were cases he was seeing timeouts where this wouldn't have been an issue, so I was going to wait to see what he could find.
