I think I didn't make it clear. When developing big data tasks in zeppelin, users write zeppelin `note`, which is consist of one or multiple `paragraphs`. You can run the whole note or just a specific paragraph. Currently ds zeppelin task plugin only supports trigger zeppelin paragraphs. Enabling note-level zeppelin task means ds will be able to trigger a whole zeppelin note. To enable `note-level` zeppelin task scheduling, we just need to call `submitNote` method from `Zeppelin Client APIs`. The reason why I didn't use this API is because at that time, there was no `cancelNote` method in `Zeppelin Client APIs`. Once we trigger a zeppelin note from ds, we would not be able to cancel it, which may lead to some issues. Since `Zeppelin Client API` now includes `canceNote` method, we can add this feature in ds zeppelin task plugin.  It doesn't need database storage or resource management stuff.
