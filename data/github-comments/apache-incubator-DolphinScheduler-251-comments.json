Search before asking\n\n- [X] I had searched in the [issues](https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues?q=is%3Aissue) and found no similar issues.\n\n\n### What happened\n\nDolphinscheduler version 2.0.5 is deployed in cluster mode. The workflow is configured with global parameters. When you manually click to execute and select the complement, the startup parameters will not take effect.\r\nThis problem did not reproduce when testing locally.\r\n\n\n### What you expected to happen\n\nLooking at the master log, it is found that the master can get the value of the startup parameter, but it is not passed to the worker\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23436224/173731214-e527fe0e-2b48-4f40-9dff-1cc06fb053bc.png)\r\n\n\n### How to reproduce\n\nMy deployment environment is 4 machines, starting 2 masters and 4 worker processes\r\nCreate a new shell task on the page and output a parameter, similar to echo \"${data}\"\r\nAdd a global variable to the workflow\r\nCheck the complement number when starting the task, and set the startup parameters to non-default values. Viewing the log does not output the correct startup parameters.\n\n### Anything else\n\n_No response_\n\n### Version\n\n2.0.5\n\n### Are you willing to submit PR?\n\n- [X] Yes I am willing to submit a

a deep checking. I found the following differences in both core module's ```DolphinSchedulerExtension.java```.\r\n\r\n1. The ```beforeAll``` and ```afterAll``` function would set ```webdriver``` and ``` browser``` in ```E2E-Test``` module. However, ```API-Test``` modules do not need these.\r\n2. Based on the first point, there is no need to pull other additional containers in the ```API-Test``` module for local mode and non local mode. So there is no need to distinguishing container images of M1 chip.\r\n\r\nAs we can see, the implementation of the ```core``` module of the ```API-Test``` and ```E2E-Test``` is quite different. So if we want to combine these two modules into one. I think we need to create an abstract class. And then implement its own logic in the ```core``` of the two modules.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure whether we need to do this since it's not much different from now.

thank you for your review, very nice catching :) \r\n\r\nI also have some suggestions:\r\nas we are only contributors, not owners, so our new code style is best to refer to the existing code, this will make the project code management clearer. So it would be even better if  all the similar pages using the similar template, this pr front-end code is copied from the environment page. Obviously, the environment code can't be recognized by project owners, it does have some small areas that can be optimized. For our contributors, we'd better not be unconventional, but keep the same way of code writing style.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1155955820/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1155958748","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/10449#issuecomment-1155958748","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/10449","id":1155958748,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms5E5ofc","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-15T04:05:45Z","updated_at":"2022-06-15T04:05:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Search before asking\n\n- [X] I had searched in the [issues](https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues?q=is%3Aissue) and found no similar issues.\n\n\n### What happened\n\nUsing dolphinscheduler to schedule 100,000-level workflows per day, when using mysql as the metadata database for millions of tasks, the pressure on mysql is too high\r\nAs shown in the figure below, MySQL is initially configured with 2 cores and 4G, and the CPU usage is very high.\r\nThen upgrade mysql to 8 cores and 16g, and soon the cpu usage will reach 100%\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23436224/173733315-ddd21919-afb9-4d9e-b36c-41447a8e9d8a.png)\r\n\n\n### What you expected to happen\n\nAfter troubleshooting, it was found that the data volume of the three tables t_ds_task_instance, t_ds_process_instance, and t_ds_relation_process_instance was too large, and no entry was configured to delete the data.\r\nThe reason for the high usage of mysql cpu is that a large number of the same statements query the t_ds_relation_process_instance table. The query statements are as follows:\r\nselect id, parent_process_instance_id, parent_task_instance_id, process_instance_id from t_ds_relation_process_instance where parent_process_instance_id = 667735 and parent_task_instance_id = 2454593;\r\n\r\nThis table does not have an appropriate index created, causing each query to scan the full table.\r\nTherefore, you can add an index to this table, which can greatly relieve the pressure on MySQL.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23436224/173734401-adedb8c0-bbdc-4bc2-8b9a-0ee246e32060.png)\r\n\r\n\n\n### How to reproduce\n\nWorkflow and task parallelism are the default values, and the metadata database is mysql\r\nSchedule hundreds of workflows per hour, each with dozens of tasks\r\nExecuting for a period of time will fill up the mysql cpu\n\n### Anything else\n\n_No response_\n\n### Version\n\n2.0.5\n\n### Are you willing to submit PR?\n\n- [X] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1155958748/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1155958883","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/10449#issuecomment-1155958883","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/10449","id":1155958883,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms5E5ohj","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-15T04:05:58Z","updated_at":"2022-06-15T04:05:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you for your feedback, we have received your issue, Please wait patiently for a reply.\n* In order for us to understand your request as soon as possible, please provide detailed information、version or pictures.\n* If you haven't received a reply for a long time, you can [join our slack](https://s.apache.org/dolphinscheduler-slack) and send your question to channel `#troubleshooting`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1155958883/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1155963263","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/pull/10442#issuecomment-1155963263","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/10442","id":1155963263,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms5E5pl_","user":{"login":"kezhenxu94","id":15965696,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTY1Njk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15965696?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94","html_url":"https://github.com/kezhenxu94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-15T04:13:20Z","updated_at":"2022-06-15T04:13:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> After a deep checking. I found the following differences in both core module's ```DolphinSchedulerExtension.java```.\n> \n> \n> \n> 1. The ```beforeAll``` and ```afterAll``` function would set ```webdriver``` and ``` browser``` in ```E2E-Test``` module. However, ```API-Test``` modules do not need these.\n> \n> 2. Based on the first point, there is no need to pull other additional containers in the ```API-Test``` module for local mode and non local mode. So there is no need to distinguishing container images of M1 chip.\n> \n> \n> \n> As we can see, the implementation of the ```core``` module of the ```API-Test``` and ```E2E-Test``` is quite different.
