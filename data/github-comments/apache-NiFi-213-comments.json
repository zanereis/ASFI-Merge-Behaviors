I agree with the problem and the general approach. The only concern that I have here is with the new `ValidationResult` class. Specifically, I don't think it makes sense to create a `ValidationResult` and then call `add_validation_result` on that object. I would also like to avoid having to create a `ValidationResult` just to call `build_validation_result_list()` just in order to return it.\r\n\r\nRather, I think we should define `ValidationResult` to have an `init` that takes those 4 parameters (`subject`, `valid`, `explanation`, input`) and just return a `list` of them from the method. For example, we should be able to implement the above as:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  def customValidate(self, context):\r\n      results = []\r\n      results.append(new ValidationResult(subject=\"Test subject 1\", explanation=\"Test validation 1\", valid=False, input=\"Input 1\")\r\n      results.append(new ValidationResult(subject=\"Test subject 2\", explanation=\"Test validation 2\", valid=False, input=\"Input 1\")\r\n      return results\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr, alternatively,\r\n```\r\n  def customValidate(self, context):\r\n      return [\r\n            new ValidationResult(subject=\"Test subject 1\", explanation=\"Test validation 1\", valid=False, input=\"Input 1\"),\r\n            new ValidationResult(subject=\"Test subject 2\", explanation=\"Test validation 2\", valid=False, input=\"Input 1\")]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `PythonProcessorAdapter`, then, should be responsible for taking that Python `list` that is returned and converting it into the `ArrayList` needed by the framework.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2214130908/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2214163495","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/9058#issuecomment-2214163495","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/9058","id":2214163495,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM6D-XQn","user":{"login":"turcsanyip","id":35004384,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MDA0Mzg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35004384?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip","html_url":"https://github.com/turcsanyip","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-08T14:01:30Z","updated_at":"2024-07-08T14:01:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@exceptionfactory Thanks for cleaning up the Kerberos config in these components!\r\nI think it would also be useful to add migration code for helping the move from the old controller service (or processor level properties) to `KerberosUserService`.

I added the `migrateProperties()` methods to remove existing references to the legacy properties as an incremental step forward. I wasn't planning to include a full migration in this pull request, but I think it could be considered a follow-on effort. With these components supporting both direct properties and the `KerberosCredentialsService`, a complete solution would have to consider each scenario, and there may be some opportunity for reuse in some components.

But what we really want is for Calcite not to mess with the Timestamp object we give it at all. When you call `ResultSet.getTimestamp(1)`, it should be returning the same object as if you call `Result.getObject(1)` but Avatica doesn't it see it that way. Instead, when you call `ResultSet.getTimestamp(1)` with Avatica it attempts to localize the Timestamp according to its configured TimeZone. If not specified, it uses the local timezone as that configured TimeZone. In essence what I'm doing with this PR is telling it to use UTC as the configured TImeZone so that it doesn't do any manipulation / localization.\r\n\r\nSo that's why I wrote the unit test as I did - when I give it a timestamp, and then get back a timezone, it should be:\r\n(a) the same value that I gave to it, and\r\n(b) the same result regardless of whether I call `ResultSet.getObject` vs. `ResultSet.getTimestamp`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2218266795/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2218713079","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/9017#issuecomment-2218713079","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/9017","id":2218713079,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM6EPt_3","user":{"login":"bbende","id":605416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTQxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende","html_url":"https://github.com/bbende","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-09T20:53:38Z","updated_at":"2024-07-09T20:53:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@exceptionfactory @gresockj I pushed up another commit that adds support for handling of NARs containing Python processors.

This was my first attempt at upgrading the dependencies of our Nx monorepository using their tools to do so and while I did find them helpful it didn't solve all the upgrade issues.

As far as I understand, Parameter Providers are special in the sense they do not belong to Process Groups, but rather they are 'Controller Level' components. The current implementation does not work, as it seems like the `migrateProperties` function does not get called, even though there is a Parameter Provider defined in the `flow.json.gz`, which was copied from a previous version of NiFi.\r\n\r\nI'm pretty much stuck. Please help me with some hints.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2228821240/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2229026172","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/9081#issuecomment-2229026172","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/9081","id":2229026172,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM6E3D18","user":{"login":"dan-s1","id":8440116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NDAxMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8440116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1","html_url":"https://github.com/dan-s1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-15T17:27:32Z","updated_at":"2024-07-15T17:27:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@exceptionfactory I cannot seem to restart the `MacOs`  build (as the current failure has nothing to do with my changes).

I think that it is a good approach to offer the same functionality both in Python and Java side, however I feel it is unnecessary to add methods that are currently unused. Over time we can further extend the Python side with additional methods when new functionalities will require them.\r\n\r\n- Renaming 'getProperties()' to 'getAllProperties()' wouldn't be good because they have different return type in Java side\r\n- At this point I would also avoid code duplication, since both contexts use the same approach for 'getProperties()' and 'newPropertyValue()' so I would keep it as it is for now.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2230834458/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2231178216","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/8992#issuecomment-2231178216","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/8992","id":2231178216,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM6E_RPo","user":{"login":"MikeThomsen","id":108184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODE4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeThomsen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-16T15:11:21Z","updated_at":"2024-07-16T15:11:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@exceptionfactory
