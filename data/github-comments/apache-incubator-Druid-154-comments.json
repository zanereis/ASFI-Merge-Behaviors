some thoughts:\r\n\r\n- The \"98% right\" thing is meant to refer to average error of HyperLogLog, but certainly the error in any particular case can be greater than that.\r\n- Druid's implementation deviates from the standard algorithm (see http://druid.io/blog/2014/02/18/hyperloglog-optimizations-for-real-world-systems.html) in a way that decreases storage space but can increase the error slightly in some cases.\r\n- Yes changing the number of buckets is a good way to improve the accuracy.

In which situations would segments be merged? Only in a Merge Task or any hadoop index task or only in re-indexing tasks? Is it correct to assume that \"indexing\" is something that only happens during the ingestion of data, so it is not happening on broker/historical, right? To my understanding, \"indexing\" is the creation of an index which would happen only during the ingestion of data, but then again, in the query phase, segments get scanned and segments contain indexes and they get merged and there are merge buffers, so I was wondering whether \"segment merging during indexing\" only refers to the index creation in the ingestion phase or also something that happens during query processing? I think its the first but I'm insecure...\r\n\r\n\"indexing\" used in this context is referring to \"ingestion\",  so merge tasks, hadoop index tasks, re-indexing tasks, kafka supervisor tasks, etc. can all involve segment merging. (From a code perspective, things that use IndexMerger).\r\n\r\nI updated the doc changes in this PR to mention \"ingestion\" instead of \"indexing\" to be more clear.\r\n\r\n> \"fuzzy parameter meant to account for the decompression and dictionary merging buffers\"\r\nPrior to this phrase, the documentation mentions \"merge buffers\" but I got the feeling that \"dictionary merge buffers\" are yet something else. If so, it would be great to get a brief explanation of what they are and where they come into play (historicals? / brokers? etc)\r\n\r\nThe dictionary merge buffers are described in the second point under \"Other sources of direct memory usage include:\", I updated that with a point about how these buffers are independent of the other \"merge buffers\".\r\n\r\n> \"Indexing workers and historical\"\r\nI've been working with Druid for 18 months now but I'm still insecure about the use of the term \"Indexing\" as the documentation as a whole explains terms like overlord/middlemanager/peons/realtime nodes but then uses terms like \"indexing service\" or \"indexing workers\" and I don't know what exactly how these notions connect. What exactly is meant by \"Indexing workers\" in this case? Does it mean Peons/Middlemanagers? Other documentation also sometimes talks of \"indexing service\" in which case I'm not sure if \"indexing service\" is the short form of \"Kafka Indexing service\" or if \"indexing-service\" == overlord+middlemanagers+peons or if Indexing service == realtime nodes... I do feel that I understand all concepts and moving parts of Druid, it's just the terminology itself that throws me. A reoccuring pattern is that I read about similar terms and don't know if they are synonymous or not.\r\n\r\n\"Indexing workers\" in this PR was referring to worker tasks that perform ingestion (peons), spawned by the overlord or middlemanager.\r\n\r\n>Below the newly added documentation, there is a section that says\r\n\"Larger values allow for more aggregations in a single pass over the data while smaller values can require more passes depending on the query that is being executed\"\r\nHow can I tell whether Druid is needing several passes over the data? To my understanding, in order to achieve top performance, Druid should be doing only a single pass over the data. Therefore, I would like to make the processsing buffers sufficiently large such that for all query scenarios that can occur on my particular cluster, all query processing would be done in a single-pass fashion. So how can I tell whether that is actually happening? Lets say I have a testsuite covering all query scenarios over my particular dataset. How can I measure how many passes Druid ends up taking given my current memory settings? There is a segment scan time metric and if it is too high, that might indicate several passes, but thats just a fuzzy measure. Is there a way to read off how many passes were taken? Is this being logged or emitted as a metric?\r\n\r\nI'm not aware of any existing metrics or logs that track number of query passes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/321705876/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/321710512","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/4482#issuecomment-321710512","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4482","id":321710512,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMTcxMDUxMg==","user":{"login":"leventov","id":609240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwOTI0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/609240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov","html_url":"https://github.com/leventov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-11T00:52:11Z","updated_at":"2017-08-11T00:52:11Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@jihoonson thanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/321710512/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/321723756","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/4532#issuecomment-321723756","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4532","id":321723756,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMTcyMzc1Ng==","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-11T03:12:13Z","updated_at":"2017-08-11T03:12:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Also, please add a doc for new post aggregators.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/321723756/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/321730521","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/4609#issuecomment-321730521","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4609","id":321730521,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMTczMDUyMQ==","user":{"login":"niketh","id":626548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNjU0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/626548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketh","html_url":"https://github.com/niketh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-11T04:36:53Z","updated_at":"2017-08-11T04:58:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jon-wei Looking at it.
