I've addressed several multi-lang issues so I had been interested on multi-lang feature of Storm, but few people have interest on maintaining / improving basic implementation of multilang protocol in various language even python.<br/>\n    Pystorm seems great, and we lack contributors who care multi-lang implementations as one of major module so I'd still rather rely on stable implementation than build from scratch. Just one concern for me is that it seems to be heavily depending on you (I mean individual) so I'm curious we feel safe to rely on.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612874811/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/227433138","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1136#issuecomment-227433138","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1136","id":227433138,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNzQzMzEzOA==","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-21T13:05:33Z","updated_at":"2016-06-21T13:05:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@dan-blanchard
