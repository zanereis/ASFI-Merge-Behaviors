One scenario, where this will result in undesirable output is when the entire cluster is restarted.\n\nLet's day P was on NODE_0 and NODE_1, we paused the controller, restarted all nodes and unpaused controller. It's desirable to put P on the same nodes (NODE_0, NODE_1), but since we remove it from the map, it might reassign it to another node and this will cause a lot of reshuffling.\n\nAnother alternative is to keep the current code but during sorting use the state priority followed by node names. With this change  currentMapping: `{P: {NODE_0: OFFLINE, NODE_1: ONLINE}}` after sorting should result in `[NODE_1, NODE_0]` and hence no movement.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/258007331/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/258008070","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/helix/pull/58#issuecomment-258008070","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/58","id":258008070,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1ODAwODA3MA==","user":{"login":"mkscrg","id":471342,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MTM0Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/471342?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkscrg","html_url":"https://github.com/mkscrg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkscrg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkscrg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkscrg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkscrg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkscrg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkscrg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkscrg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkscrg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkscrg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-02T21:42:50Z","updated_at":"2016-11-02T21:42:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@kishoreg that makes sense.
