Thanks for your attention, I will try to explain.\r\n\r\nAs you may have noticed, we support a service definition with a CompletableFuture as the return type.\r\n```java\r\npublic interface AsyncService {\r\n    CompletableFuture<String> sayHello(String name);\r\n}\r\n``` \r\n\r\nBut this is newly introduced in 2.7.0, which means, there would be many legacy services that can not leverage this feature. Because if they change the service definition (the interface definition) they will have to reimplement their service to meet the new definition.\r\nFor example, here is a typical service definition before 2.7.0\r\n```java\r\npublic interface GreetingsService {\r\n    String sayHi(String name);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nTo be able to call this service asynchronously, they have to use `RpcContext` to get the `Future`, like this:\r\n```java\r\n// the invoke will return null immediately\r\ngreetingsService.sayHi(\"world\");\r\n// get the Future instance, the future will get notified once the result returns.\r\nFuture<String> future = RpcContext.getContext().getFuture();\r\n```\r\nAnnotation @AsyncFor is a mechanism I introduced to simplify the process for those legacy services, you can refer to [here](https://github.com/dubbo/dubbo-async-processor/tree/deprecated-processer) for how it works.\r\n\r\nBut now, as long as I realized we have supported java 8, we can use the default method to avoid generating a new class. [Here](https://github.com/dubbo/dubbo-async-processor/blob/master/README.md) is the new way I have come up with, this is what mean by saying `move the @AsyncFor from core to side project '. This way, this would become a convenient solution we provide but not a mandatory solution provided in core.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/450479280/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/450487219","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/pull/3099#issuecomment-450487219","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3099","id":450487219,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MDQ4NzIxOQ==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-29T11:48:28Z","updated_at":"2019-01-01T07:49:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#

Because if they change the service definition (the interface definition) they will have to reimplement their service to meet the new definition.\r\n> For example, here is a typical service definition before 2.7.0\r\n> \r\n> ```java\r\n> public interface GreetingsService {\r\n>     String sayHi(String name);\r\n> }\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> To be able to call this service asynchronously, they have to use `RpcContext` to get the `Future`, like this:\r\n> \r\n> ```java\r\n> // the invoke will return null immediately\r\n> greetingsService.sayHi(\"world\");\r\n> // get the Future instance, the future will get notified once the result returns.\r\n> Future<String> future = RpcContext.getContext().getFuture();\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> Annotation @AsyncFor is a mechanism I introduced to simplify the process for those legacy services, you can refer to [here](https://github.com/dubbo/dubbo-async-processor/tree/deprecated-processer) for how it works.\r\n> \r\n> But now, as long as I realized we have supported java 8, we can use the default method to avoid generating a new class. [Here](https://github.com/dubbo/dubbo-async-processor/blob/master/README.md) is the new way I have come up with, this is what mean by saying `move the @AsyncFor from core to side project '. This way, this would become a convenient solution we provide but not a mandatory solution provided in core.\r\n\r\n  @chickenlj Thanks a lot for the details. Appreciate it.\r\n\r\n  I will give a look into this PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/450500728/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/450503604","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/pull/3101#issuecomment-450503604","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3101","id":450503604,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MDUwMzYwNA==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-29T16:20:34Z","updated_at":"2018-12-29T16:20:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#

\r\n1.  dubbo支持多注册，多消费\r\n可以将你们的Provider为每个注册中心都注册一份数据，消费方消费多个注册中心服务，目前dubbo是按照配置注册中心的循序进行消费，比如是配置了redis, zk注册中心，优先消费redis服务，如果redis没有服务会自动去消费zk服务\r\n\r\n2. 这个和注册中心实现没有关系, 有2中方法可以支持你的需求：\r\na. org.apache.dubbo.config.ReferenceConfig#createProxy\r\nAvailableCluster 默认是根据配置顺序消费注册中心数据，可以实现新的Cluster决定消费策略\r\nb. 你可以实现一个路由Router，多个注册中心在运行时动态决定消费哪个注册中心服务\r\n\r\nGoogle translation：\r\n\r\nDubbo supports multiple registrations, more consumption\r\nYou can register your Provider for each registration center, and the consumer consumes multiple registration center services. Currently, dubbo is consumed according to the configuration registration center. For example, redis, zk registration center, priority consumption redis Service, if redis no service will automatically consume zk service\r\n\r\nThis has nothing to do with the registry implementation. There are 2 ways to support your needs:\r\na. org.apache.dubbo.config.ReferenceConfig#createProxy\r\nAvailableCluster defaults to consuming registry data sequentially according to configuration\r\nb. You can implement a routing router, and multiple registries dynamically determine which registrar service to consume at runtime.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/450541460/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/450541704","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/3082#issuecomment-450541704","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3082","id":450541704,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MDU0MTcwNA==","user":{"login":"zonghaishang","id":15549777,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTQ5Nzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15549777?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang","html_url":"https://github.com/zonghaishang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-30T06:16:59Z","updated_at":"2018-12-30T06:16:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"只是使用方式问题，自己可以封装一个Bean,

As here we are enabling dubbo consumer to  make async call to service method, but to achieve this, service provider has to define the stub with CompletableFuture. Here whether a consumer can make a async call depends on whether service developer has enabled service interface with CompletableFuture or not in some form. \r\n\r\nThe decision of communication mode (async or async) is consumer choice. So thinking, how can we make our provider and consumer independent or each other in this context. \r\n\r\ne.g. here an an analogy I am using to provide the approach\r\njava hashmap is not synchronized but java collections come up with Collection.jave and provided a utility method `java.util.Collections.synchronizedMap()` which actually wrap hashmap with thread safety behavior. \r\n\r\n@chickenlj Do
