At minimum, any changes should not require public-facing `ProvenanceReporter` changes because the `StandardProcessSession` could populate relationship information on provenance records. More evaluation would be required in that direction, but it highlights the importance of scoping any changes as narrowly as possible when it comes to the `nifi-api` interfaces.

The last item to address it the `required()` status for the new property. As mentioned in the comment, it can be set to `true` since the default value provided maintains compatibility with existing configuration.\r\n\r\nTechnically we could make it required, but we don't automatically do that in such cases. When a property is essential on a conceptual level, we make it required but leave it optional otherwise, even if it has a default value.\r\n\r\nThis is more about UX but it makes sense. This can't be considered a conceptually essential parameter, like 'Table Name' for example.

I do not run on Windows as frequently, but if `bin` is the common directory on macOS and Linux, and `Scripts` is common on Windows, it seems possible to check for the existence of each sub-directory and select one accordingly. That would avoid the need for a new property and the potential complexity. What do you think about that approach?\r\n\r\nHi @exceptionfactory  thanks for the quick reply.  Yes I am open to a more automated approach see [1] .  I think checking the parent directory for the sub-directory rather than specifically checking for OS might be much simpler.

From another angle, making the property optional leaves the behavior ambiguous, because the property value could be an empty string.

> Can you provide some additional background on the reason for introducing a PowerShell alternative to the `nifi.cmd` script for Windows? It would be ideal to maintain a unified approach for Windows, as opposed to maintaining two separate scripts for the same OS.\r\n> \r\n> I am just starting out with NiFi, so I will have to speak in generalities.\r\n> \r\n> Making changes to _.cmd/_.bat files is fraught (for me). Every time I think I am going to make a small change to one it ends up being a time sink.\r\n> \r\n> I am planning on extensively using NiFi for a project I am working on. A lot of the work will involve dynamic deployment of NiFi components on a dynamic cluster. I anticipate building tooling to support this work. I would much prefer to use powershell over CMD/BAT. I plan on contributing this tooling back to Apache.\r\n> \r\n> It may be that the tooling would be better written in one of the JVM scripting languages (i.e. Groovy, Kotlin, Clojure). That said I expect that some of the tooling would still best be written as powershell modules on Windows.\r\n> \r\n> Obviously, the `nifi.ps1` is not (yet) a powershell module, I am getting a feel for how the NiFi project operates. I would like to see the `nifi.cmd` deprecated in favor of powershell modules.\r\n\r\nThanks for additional background @phreed.\r\n\r\nThe shell scripts are intended to provide a minimum wrapper around the environment settings necessary to start NiFi Java processes. For that reason, these scripts should be as minimal as possible, and provide the broadest base of compatibility. That is why the current scripts for Windows do not use PowerShell, and should avoid additional complexity. That is also the reason why they do not use any type of JVM scripting.\r\n\r\nRunning NiFi on Windows is supported in general, but running scalable production deployments most often depends on Linux as the operating system.\r\n\r\nSo with that background, any shell script changes should continue to follow the minimalist approach to maintain compatibility across modern distributions of Windows. With that in mind, it may be best to avoid introducing PowerShell scripts in favor of retaining the limited scope of command scripting. This does highlight the need for reviewing the general approach of Windows startup scripts, including the removal of the `BAT` scripts.\r\n\r\nIf the PowerShell approach works without installing any additional Windows packages on current versions of both Home and Pro, then this seems like a potential option. Are you aware of any compatibility issues with PowerShell on recent Windows versions, particularly on non-server editions?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2004018034/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2004127985","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/8505#issuecomment-2004127985","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/8505","id":2004127985,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM53dJDx","user":{"login":"Freedom9339","id":66659434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NjU5NDM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66659434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Freedom9339","html_url":"https://github.com/Freedom9339","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Freedom9339/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Freedom9339/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Freedom9339/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Freedom9339/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Freedom9339/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Freedom9339/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Freedom9339/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Freedom9339/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Freedom9339/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-18T14:51:01Z","updated_at":"2024-03-18T15:13:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@exceptionfactory \r\n\r\nThank you for the review.
