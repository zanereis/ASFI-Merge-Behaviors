We don't want to blindly just replace all `Thread.sleep` usage. We need to understand why the sleep is used in the first place.\r\n\r\nTypically, `Thread.sleep` is used to wait for an async condition to happen. Rather than waiting the max sleep time, we want to wait less than that, by checking a success condition that indicates we can proceed.\r\n\r\nHere is a good example where the test was made more stable by the use of Awaitility: https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/cff2ff9d2f533c8e733324a66f3101eafbc2e932/core/src/test/java/org/apache/iceberg/actions/TestCommitService.java#L99-L102\r\n\r\nWe wait at most 5 seconds until the given assertion is met. \r\n\r\nFor this PR that means a good starting point might be https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/f9f85e7f2647020ef7e9571f76027c8e55075690/flink/v1.17/flink/src/test/java/org/apache/iceberg/flink/source/TestStreamingMonitorFunction.java#L153, where there's a 1s sleep and then a check.

I was talking with @danielcweeks a couple days ago about v3 additions and we came up with a good reason to add `timestamp_ms` and `timestamptz_ms`. Currently, type promotion is limited to very specific changes, but we think that we will need to open that up in v3. As long as we are open to promoting types, it makes sense to let people promote `long` to `timestamp` of some kind.\r\n\r\nNow that we are adding timestamps with different units, this gives us a way to fix a long-standing problem: older data that used millisecond timestamps as longs couldn't be read as timestamps because we had no way to know the unit of the `long` (millis or micros). Now that we have separate types, we can use the type to carry that information, so that you can promote a `long` to `timestamp_ms` or `timestamp` and we know how to interpret the value.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? If you agree, then we should probably add `ms` types at the same time.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1749792874/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1749799494","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/8683#issuecomment-1749799494","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/8683","id":1749799494,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85oS9JG","user":{"login":"jacobmarble","id":622263,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMjI2Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/622263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobmarble","html_url":"https://github.com/jacobmarble","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobmarble/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobmarble/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobmarble/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobmarble/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobmarble/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobmarble/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobmarble/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobmarble/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobmarble/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-05T23:42:43Z","updated_at":"2023-10-05T23:42:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> What do you think?

I'm assuming that's the case based on your question being around the file size.\r\n\r\nCheck out https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/latest/spark-writes/#controlling-file-sizes and https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/latest/spark-writes/#writing-distribution-modes \r\n\r\n\r\nThe file size will be bounded by the Spark task size; if the task size exceeds the write.target-file-size-bytes, the writer will roll over to a new file. However, if the task size is smaller a larger file won't be written; the file will be at most the task size.

The docs I linked earlier put it concisely when it says \"When writing data to Iceberg with Spark, it’s important to note that Spark cannot write a file larger than a Spark task and a file cannot span an Iceberg partition boundary. This means although Iceberg will always roll over a file when it grows to [write.target-file-size-bytes](https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/latest/configuration/#write-properties), but unless the Spark task is large enough that will not happen.\" \r\n\r\nThe property controls rolling over to a new file when the file is about to exceed the target size. So it does respect the target file size. If the Spark task is not large enough, then you won't see files hit the \"write.target-file-size-bytes\". To influence the Spark task size you can see the write.distribution-mode properties in the docs (and if you're using 1.3.1 the default will be the hash based)\r\n\r\n>I just tried bumping up the value of this setting by times 10 (5368709120), and the file sizes are still around 100MB.\r\n\r\nRight, bumping it up won't magically make the files bigger, it depends on the task size which is determined by Spark (the point above)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1750162049/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1750169496","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/7094#issuecomment-1750169496","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/7094","id":1750169496,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85oUXeY","user":{"login":"gzagarwal","id":768791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2ODc5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/768791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzagarwal","html_url":"https://github.com/gzagarwal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzagarwal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzagarwal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzagarwal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzagarwal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzagarwal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzagarwal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzagarwal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzagarwal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzagarwal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-06T08:12:59Z","updated_at":"2023-10-06T08:15:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":">
