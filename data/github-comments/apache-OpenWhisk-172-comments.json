Processing from the buffer or event feed is now strictly event based rather than if nothing is available in the container pool to run it. That function has to be called based on some event now (a container freeing up for example) to reprocess the message rather than before it would just continually try to re-run that message on a loop. I don't have an edge case yet, but I would think this method of pulling from the buffer or message feed would be prone to edge cases especially when the invoker is under load.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/openwhisk/commit/a7482ca22694eee9b578c1003cd2c847953273e8#diff-907fea4f2800af33d571845b19ddc9a24a44d481994305f344c23d33310d471aL205","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/767165797/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/767631779","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/5053#issuecomment-767631779","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/5053","id":767631779,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2NzYzMTc3OQ==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-26T15:44:34Z","updated_at":"2021-01-27T01:24:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The backlog is generally not a good symptom - but iirc there is a low expiration on the topic which should retire messages.

The retention period is two days for the invoker topics. Ours have seven day retention since we use a shared kafka fleet, but that's an us problem. But for reference it took us about three hours to run through five days of consistently sent healthchecks that built up. So would have still taken about an hour for us to catch up if we were using the correct retention period on our hardware.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/767716805/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/767944155","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/5053#issuecomment-767944155","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/5053","id":767944155,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2Nzk0NDE1NQ==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-27T01:25:11Z","updated_at":"2021-01-27T01:25:11Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"No, I mean that there is a backlog on the health topic is a bad symptom.
