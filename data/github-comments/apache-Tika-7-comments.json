I recommend to change the practice and not push or merge into master unless the build is stable (with fast-forward merges and rebasing any pollution of the git history can be avoided)\r\n\r\n`master` branch in out case is development branch, not a release one. It has both historical and organizational reasons: we migrated from `svn` where branches and tags are quite expensive, so we haven't adopted gitflow or something similar which use motto `master is stable and always builds` which is relevant for software with CD-pipeline in the first place. Organizational part is even harder, we are group of individuals from different companies and different places around the planet (same applies to all Apache Software Foundation projects). It leads to asynchronous communication with large latencies and more complicated repo guidelines would get a lot of valuable time: both PMC/committers' and contributors'. So other global or organizational tasks have higher prio to me. I think github is not the best place for such discussions, so if you want to continue it and bring to attention of other Tika devs I'll suggest to mail to dev@tika.apache.org (see docs at http://tika.apache.org/mail-lists.html to subscribe).\r\n\r\n> which makes it hard to start commiting to the project because one needs a building project in order to start working because suggesting improvements of the base of the latest release produces unnecessary merge work.\r\n\r\nUsually it isn't that bad) Also, you can base your patch on release tag, test it and rebase onto `master` before merge. If a build from release tag fails it usually means some exotic environment which slipped off out attention and probably to be fixed in `master` to avoid such issues in next release.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/comments/319362536/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/comments/319397182","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tika/pull/197#issuecomment-319397182","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/197","id":319397182,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxOTM5NzE4Mg==","user":{"login":"krichter722","id":4369372,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNjkzNzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4369372?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/krichter722","html_url":"https://github.com/krichter722","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krichter722/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krichter722/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krichter722/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krichter722/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krichter722/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krichter722/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krichter722/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krichter722/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krichter722/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-01T15:01:25Z","updated_at":"2017-08-01T15:02:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for you detailed explanation.\r\n\r\n> Organizational part is even harder, we are group of individuals from different companies and different places around the planet (same applies to all Apache Software Foundation projects).\r\n\r\nThat applies to almost any FLOSS project that exists and is hardly worth mentioning. Local distribution and communication latency isn't a good reason to allow failing builds on `master`. The discussion could continue on the mailing list, but I see no sense in it since having a main development branch that doesn't build reliably is a no-go for contributions from my side and it's basically a yes-no-decision - I didn't want to contribute much, but other devs might and it'd be a pity to loose their contributions - it's your decision and I understand you priorities.\r\n\r\n> Also, you can base your patch on release tag, test it and rebase onto master before merge.\r\n\r\nThat causes unnecessary work and should be discouraged.
