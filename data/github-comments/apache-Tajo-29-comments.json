I think we need to change the test query.

When I tested this patch against 10TB dataset, a lot of fetch timeouts occurred while transferring intermediate data between stages. The main reason looks that index lookup takes a lot of time (over 30 seconds with cache miss). So, I think the fundamental solution is to improve index search performance which need to be handled in another jira. \nSo, I'd like to suggest to increase fetch timeout temporarily.
