@Limess : So, is the expectation that, if you set checkpoint = 0, deltastreamer should start from scratch as though we are starting deltastreamer for the first time ?\r\n\r\nYes that's the expectation - this is also what currently happens, but where it doesn't match my expectations is that the subsequent commit is skipped so nothing is actually written.\r\n\r\nIntuitively I'd expect that if the checkpoint < the commit timestamp, Hudi should always commit.\r\n\r\n> if you wish to override the checkpoint, probably you need to set --initial-checkpoint-provider.\r\n> \r\n>

If target schema is set explicitly in deltastreamer, hudi tries to honor that and will not do the reconcile. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/989076089/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/989106784","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/4235#issuecomment-989106784","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4235","id":989106784,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM469JJg","user":{"login":"kywe665","id":1703248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDMyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1703248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kywe665","html_url":"https://github.com/kywe665","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kywe665/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kywe665/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kywe665/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kywe665/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kywe665/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kywe665/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kywe665/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kywe665/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kywe665/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-08T19:02:01Z","updated_at":"2021-12-08T19:02:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Good comments, I updated accordingly","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/989106784/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/989122167","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/4055#issuecomment-989122167","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4055","id":989122167,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM469M53","user":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-08T19:17:49Z","updated_at":"2021-12-08T19:17:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"yeah. probably schema issue. @JB-data : Can you confirm that the target schema you set in your configs matches the output from sql transformer?

For queries that process more data, majority of the time spent is going to be on I/O, reading files. And Hudi provides the widest set of data plane capabilities in any open data lake storage at this time - clustering, compaction, space-curves, indexing - to optimize the I/O\r\n\r\nAdding some real numbers here for context. The story around file listing performance has been conveyed in somewhat misleading ways in the past and we have an opportunity to educate the right way. \r\n\r\n- File listings are pretty fast in general even in cloud storage like s3. For e.g here are the p50 list latencies for a single folder with 100, 1K, 10K, 100K files/objects is 50ms, 131ms, 1062ms, 9932ms. Scales linearly.  On systems like HDFS, it's going to be even faster, since it's all cached on a JVM\r\n\r\n```\r\nFSBenchmark.listStatus:listStatus·p0.50    s3://8l-tpcds-data/s3_bench  ./s3-bench-conf.properties        1      100000  run-1621043108527  sample        9932.112             ms/op\r\nFSBenchmark.listStatusLatency:listStatusLatency·p0.50    s3://8l-tpcds-data/s3_bench  ./s3-bench-conf.properties        1       10000  run-1621027957414  sample       1062.207           ms/op\r\nFSBenchmark.listStatus:listStatus·p0.50    s3://8l-tpcds-data/s3_bench  ./s3-bench-conf.properties        1        1000  run-1621033979258  sample         131.924             ms/op\r\nFSBenchmark.listStatus:listStatus·p0.50    s3://8l-tpcds-data/s3_bench  ./s3-bench-conf.properties        1         100  run-1621033449117  sample         55.312             ms/op\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n- So the real problem is actually just the throttling of the list requests when do it hierarchically on multi-level directory prefixes. I am not sure if Cloud stores other than S3 have this sort of throttling issues. \r\n\r\nHudi improves file listing performance in the following ways. \r\n\r\n- Metadata table, provides listings from an internal metadata table, can take about `100-500ms` per read, even for very large tables.\r\n- Timeline server caches portions of the metadata (currently only for writers), and provides ~10ms performance for listings and that's how Hudi is best suited for large scale incremental/streaming pipelines on the lake.

In other words, we benefit from v1 API providing ways to shuffle the dataframe further before writing to disk and IIUC v2 takes this flexibility away? \r\n\r\nAssuming I am correct (and spark has not introduced any new APIs that help us mitigate this), should we do the following?\r\n\r\n- introduce a new `hudiv2` datasource i.e `spark.write.format(\"hudiv2\")` that just supports bulk_insert on the datasource write path.\r\n- We also add a new `SparkDatasetWriteClient` which exposes methods for upsert,delete, .. and we use that as the basis for our SQL/DML layer as well.\r\n- We continue to support the v1 `hudi` datasource as-is for sometime.
