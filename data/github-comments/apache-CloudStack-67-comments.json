we have added unit testing and Marvin tests, and we posted the results of Marvin in the Jira ticket, but in order to run the Marvin tests you need a Nuage VSP solution. I believe that was made clear and it is also @remibergsma 's understanding as we talked in Dublin.\nHaving that said I do understand your request, and we can work at facilitating more community testing in next releases. Also we can certainly have the conversation on how we can help you on the short hand, or we could organize a live demo of the functionality or whatever helps in building trust.

I've tried that too and that did not work, not because the jar isn't \"loaded\" by the JVM but because the driver class itself is not loaded into the memory area that holds classes.\n\nTomcat has 4 layers of class loaders: Bootstrap, System, Common and each webapp.\n\nIn the `catalina.properties` file there is a property called `common.loader` that defines which jars are available to tomcat's Common class loader. The fact that a jar is available to the class loader does not mean all classes it defines will be loaded. It only means that when a class is requested, the class loader will be able to search that jar. And, by the way, if a class is defined in multiple jars, only the first one that is found will be loaded.\n\n**So, why is it that having the jar with the right driver class available, the DriverManager still doesn't find a suitable driver?**\n\nIt turns out that the DriverManager is not actively searching for all available drivers (as specified in the Java Docs [1]). It so happens that for the driver class to be available for the DriverManager, that class has to be explicitly loaded, either by an `import com.mysql.jdbc.Driver;` statement, or a `Class.forName(\"com.mysql.jdbc.Driver\")` statement.\nI've made a very simple webapp that asks the DriverManager for a JDBC MySQL connector, and even though the correct driver is sitting in a jar that is in the class path, the DriverManager still throws a \"no suitable driver found\" exception. To make that work, all we need is to add a line of code saying `Class.forName(\"com.mysql.jdbc.Driver\");` right before asking for the connection. Adding that line proves the jar with the driver is correctly defined in the class path, and when requested the correct driver class is loaded by the JVM. \n\nWhat happens in CloudStack is that the mysql connector jar is not only searchable by the Common class loader (via `common.loader` in [0]), but it is also searchable by tomca's System class loader set in [2]. And that's the class loader that is actually loading the driver class. I'm not sure why, but my best guess is that when tomcat is booting, one of it's components (maybe tomcat-jdbc [3]) sweeps the available jars for any class implementing `java.sql.Driver` and actually finds the one we need.\n\nSo, if you want to drop a CloudStack WAR in a tomcat instance, make sure that the MySQL connector jar is the class path of the process that starts JVM.\n\nFinally, just for documentation sake, @ke4qqq, if you even read this, please grep the codebase for `Class.forName(\"com.mysql.jdbc.Driver\")`. You will find two files that contain that line, and those make the \"runtime dependency\" on a class licensed under GPL very explicit. I wonder how does that play out with Apache's policy?\n\n[0] https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/master/packaging/centos7/tomcat7/catalina.properties#L47\n[1] http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/sql/DriverManager.html\n[2] https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/master/packaging/centos7/cloud-management.sysconfig#L48\n[3] https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/jdbc-pool.html\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/153468603/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/153473377","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/801#issuecomment-153473377","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/801","id":153473377,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MzQ3MzM3Nw==","user":{"login":"jburwell","id":285646,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTY0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/285646?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell","html_url":"https://github.com/jburwell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-03T20:11:39Z","updated_at":"2015-11-03T20:11:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ustcweizhou @remibergsma this is a massive technical debt that we are carrying with other plugins, and I think we need to stop to expanding that debt.

For others, we are shipping code that has not been verified for a number of releases.

largely agree, it provides the best experience for our end users if\n```\n\nwe can always verify that plugins are functional and maintainable. On the\nflip side, it seems that's part of the point of plugins. It isolates vendor\nor implementation-specific code, making it easier to pick up by someone\nelse who may have domain knowledge but not CloudStack knowledge, or to easy\nto remove if it becomes dead code.\n\n```\nIn the case of vendors, if they stop their involvement, the most likely\n```\n\nend result is that the code won't be maintained, and if we haven't been\ngiven means to test then we won't know on our own if it is functional. If\nthe vendor has ended involvement though, even if they've provided means to\ntest the code then those means may become defunct as well (e.g. software,\nsystem, or license is deprecated), so providing means to the community for\ntesting doesn't seem to help much if we don't have continued vendor\nsupport. In the past we have simply held a community vote to determine who\ncares about the plugin, followed by removal, or if there's someone who\ncares about the code and is in a position to maintain and provide testing\nfor it, they become the community maintainer for that code.\n\n```\n One note of caution, the nature of the plugin architecture also\n```\n\nprovides room for vendors to work on their own and provide their code\nand/or artifacts to their customers. Short of the tiny core changes in this\nrequest, they don't need to provide this code to the community. I'd prefer\nto err on the side of being inviting to vendor contributions and bring the\ndevelopers into the community, rather than holding them at arm's length and\nasking for a clean handoff or insurance policy in case they disappear.\nWe've seen community members jump jobs and still stick around because they\nfound an inviting environment where their contributions were welcomed and\nvalued, and they grew within the community, and I almost consider that\nculture more important than ensuring any maintainer's duties can be\nreplaced by someone else in the community.\n\n```\nThen again, I'm only tangentially involved in the community right now,\n```\n\nso I won't feel bad if anyone takes my opinion with a grain of salt.\n\n```\n TL; DR - While I'd really, really like to see vendors provide support\n```\n\nto make their plugins testable by the community, I don't think that it buys\nus much in regards to maintaining the plugin if the vendor stops their\ncommunity involvement, short of having donated hardware with perpetual\nlicense and free updates. As such, I'd rather lower the bar for developers\nto maintain their plugin code, with the fallback of being able to easily\nremove abandoned plugin code as a last resort.\n\nOn Tue, Nov 3, 2015 at 12:11 PM, John Burwell notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> @ustcweizhou https://github.com/ustcweizhou @remibergsma\n> https://github.com/remibergsma this is a massive technical debt that we\n> are carrying with other plugins, and I think we need to stop to expanding\n> that debt.

For example, storage plug-ins have direct access to the DB via DAO objects and can accidentally delete data that doesn't belong to them.\n\nAside from those kinds of actions, Edison didn't encourage spending too much time trying to verify the correctness of storage plug-in code (that was an exercise left to the vendor).\n\nPersonally, though, I'd like to get to the point where I can bring my Marvin integration tests to the CloudStack repo and have them execute against virtual hardware. At the time being, however, this is not an option.\n\nI also like having the ability to run these integration tests against different hypervisor types and versions, but am not yet confident I know how to do this within CloudStack's integration-test environment (so I just do this in house at SolidFire).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/153517886/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/153518941","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/801#issuecomment-153518941","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/801","id":153518941,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MzUxODk0MQ==","user":{"login":"krissterckx","id":10531991,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTMxOTkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10531991?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/krissterckx","html_url":"https://github.com/krissterckx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krissterckx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krissterckx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krissterckx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krissterckx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krissterckx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krissterckx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krissterckx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krissterckx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krissterckx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-03T23:14:59Z","updated_at":"2015-11-03T23:14:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @mlsorensen .\n\nWe wanted to bring this plugin update in 4.6 still for the exact reason to update the community with enriched functionality with our latest released Nuage SDN platform.

@karuturi,\n\nSorry, perhaps too earlier here, but I don't follow completely. :)\n\nHow did you setup your environment in order to test the case you explained above? You mentioned that the rules were not there, and you had to set them up manually. However, in the next comment, you said that is might have been caused by restarting the network.\n\nDid you run the tests in an isolated environment with a new built systemvm.iso?\n\nI just want to understand how you got that scenario - no rules. Based on the new code and test, the only issue we got was the UDP/53 on the RVR.\n\nIf it was all caused by the network restart, then it's clear. And by the way, that is another issue and I will have a look at.\n\nThanks again for the tests.\n\nCheers,\nWilder\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/153596954/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/153603199","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1003#issuecomment-153603199","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1003","id":153603199,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MzYwMzE5OQ==","user":{"login":"koushik-das","id":11499860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk5ODYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11499860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das","html_url":"https://github.com/koushik-das","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-04T06:46:23Z","updated_at":"2015-11-04T06:46:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bhaisaab I think from the UI same value is passed for both name and display name. But if you use the API you can pass different values. The 'name' is set as hostname of the VM. But 'display name' is just a friendly name associated to the VM for easy reference.\n\nI don't think it is a good idea to remove display name from the VM summary page. Or the fields to be displayed in the page should be made configurable. The user may choose what all fields to display in the summary page. The same can hold for the IP address as well.\n\nAlso about displaying the IP address I think @resmo raised some valid points. In advanced zone VMs in different isolated networks can have same private IP address.
