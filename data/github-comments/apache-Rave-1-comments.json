the record:\n\nThis PR works just fine on Master branch, but fails on the Angular branch due to a missing dependency that is attempted to be downloaded during the `mvn install` step of the Maven role. The missing file is:\n\nhttp://repository.apache.org/snapshots/org/apache/rave/rave-shindig/0.23-ANGULAR-SNAPSHOT/rave-shindig-0.23-ANGULAR-SNAPSHOT.war\n\nThrough discussion on the dev mailing list @mfranklin suggested the cause of the issue might be the fact that the Angular branch is so outdated. How right he was: the branch is currently [43 commits ahead and 62 behind Master](https://github.com/apache/rave/branches/stale). I tried my hand at rebasing, but it amounted to little more than guessing given the number of merge conflicts in a number of files I've yet to work with.\n\nAnyway, @mfranklin mentioned he would try to update the Angular branch when he has a moment. Until that happens this PR should go unmerged.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rave/issues/comments/47854648/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rave/issues/comments/47958706","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rave/pull/2#issuecomment-47958706","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rave/issues/2","id":47958706,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3OTU4NzA2","user":{"login":"jamesplease","id":2322305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesplease","html_url":"https://github.com/jamesplease","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesplease/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesplease/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesplease/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesplease/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesplease/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesplease/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesplease/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesplease/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesplease/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-03T17:19:14Z","updated_at":"2014-07-03T17:19:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Needs

If there's no way to do that with Maven being the installer of Tomcat, then that sounds like a good plan.\n\nWith that said, I'm still thinking that this PR should be merged for now. Given the current installation process, not only do you need to wait 15 minutes for Maven to install Tomcat, but then you need another 15 for Vagrant to install a second Tomcat. As long as Maven installs Tomcat, then Ansible doesn't need to.\n\nIt's a trivial task for someone to add Tomcat back into Ansible. But I'm not as familiar with Maven, so I wouldn't feel confident modifying that. I'm thinking Tomcat should be added back into Ansible at the same time that it is removed from Maven.\n\nMy suggestion would be to merge this and open a ticket on Jira suggesting that we use Ansible for Tomcat instead of Maven. You can reference this PR for folks to see how to add Ansible back in.

I think what you wrote fits in with that issue. If you'd rather it be a separate issue, just let me know and I can make a new one.\n\n> Also, we need to determine the strategy for including the rave client code that manages the widgets, etc. IMO, we might not want to put that in this directory and just depend on it at build or runtime. Thoughts?\n\nI imagine it will be an Angular module like any other Angular module, and I admit I don't have any strong opinions on where we put it. My initial thought was to group it as a module within the new `rave-portal-ng` directory, alongside everything else, but if you think it'd be more organized for it to be separate then that'd be fine, too. \n\n> Given the fact that only one of you is submitting a patch at a time, and the amount of new code you are producing, it would be good to have the following for IP provenance:\n\nI don't have any updates to this discussion other than what's been said in the latest email thread.\n\nOnce we get this issue worked out, though, we can go ahead and merge this branch and start the new workflow we discussed in the latest call, where we open PRs directly against Rave.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rave/issues/comments/51494550/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rave/issues/comments/51829404","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rave/pull/10#issuecomment-51829404","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rave/issues/10","id":51829404,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxODI5NDA0","user":{"login":"sieverssj","id":1036815,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzY4MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1036815?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sieverssj","html_url":"https://github.com/sieverssj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sieverssj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sieverssj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sieverssj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sieverssj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sieverssj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sieverssj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sieverssj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sieverssj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sieverssj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-11T19:37:15Z","updated_at":"2014-08-11T19:37:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This
