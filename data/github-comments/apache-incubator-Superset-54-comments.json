Hi, I am trying to achieve the same thing with pyHive and have not been able to make it work. What is the URI you are using for setting up Superset data source? I am trying something like jdbc+hive://localhost:10000/, and it gives an error: \"Can't load plugin: sqlalchemy.dialects:jdbc.hive\". I am sure I must be missing something here.. Thanks in advance for any instructions on this.\r\n\r\n-- update --\r\nLooks like I had a hiveserver2 problem, I restarted it and then I was able to use this URI:\r\nhive://user@localhost:10000/database\r\nHowever I can't get what is listed on the wiki to work (jdbc+hive://), the error message is \"Can't load plugin: sqlalchemy.dialects:jdbc.hive\"\r\n\r\nI have another question that is, what do you mean when you say use SparkSql as backend? I am fairly new to this, but AFAIK I can save dataframes in SparkSql to a Hive table, from which I can then create a Superset table/slice using the above connector. But is there more that I can do to make this process better? My overall goal is to be able to create tables/ slices from parquet files on HDFS.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/277829235/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/277856088","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/2111#issuecomment-277856088","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/2111","id":277856088,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3Nzg1NjA4OA==","user":{"login":"jfeng15","id":8325152,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjUxNTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8325152?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfeng15","html_url":"https://github.com/jfeng15","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfeng15/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfeng15/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfeng15/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfeng15/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfeng15/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfeng15/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfeng15/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfeng15/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfeng15/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-07T00:07:18Z","updated_at":"2017-02-07T00:07:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Would

These columns are however independent, so constraining query like `datetime  > now() - 3600` doesn't automatically infer that column `date` is either today or yesterday, so you have to place constraints on both columns like `datetime > now() - 3600 AND date = today()`.\r\nSuperset by default selects only main dttm column and places constraint on it, so if `datetime` is the main column, it will still inspect all parts segmented by `date` searching for `datetime`, instead of skipping parts where `date BETWEEN toDate(constraint) AND toDate(constraint)`. Does that make sense?\r\n\r\n> This quoting should be specified in your SQLAlchemy dialect\r\n\r\nIndeed, that's fixed in 617ea1153e34a1d6cc3b609dfc162748127c02f2\r\n ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/278188345/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/278206555","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/2132#issuecomment-278206555","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/2132","id":278206555,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3ODIwNjU1NQ==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-08T02:01:40Z","updated_at":"2017-02-08T02:01:40Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"OMG thanks for fixing this!
