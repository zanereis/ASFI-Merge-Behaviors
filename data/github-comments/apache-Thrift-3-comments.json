I agree about that.\n\nI am still concerned about this sequence of events though:\nint rv = ::THRIFT_CLOSE(fd_);\n...\nif (rv < 0 && !std::uncaught_exception())\n{\n   GlobalOutput.perror(\"TFDTransport::close() \", errno_copy);\n}\n\nWhy are we ever getting into the perror case?  Why is rv < 0?  The main reason for ::THRIFT_CLOSE to fail is if fd_ is invalid.  Closing invalid file descriptors is a bug.\n\nAre you hitting the exception / perror on a regular basis?  If so, that seems like a problem.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/46441037/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/46449069","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/142#issuecomment-46449069","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/142","id":46449069,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NDQ5MDY5","user":{"login":"henrique","id":128897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODg5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/128897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrique","html_url":"https://github.com/henrique","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrique/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrique/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrique/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrique/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrique/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrique/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrique/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrique/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrique/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-06-18T15:13:15Z","updated_at":"2014-06-18T15:13:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi Ben, \nHave you had a look on the test case (and my small patch)?

Anyway, calling `TWinsockSingleton::create()` with `ifdef` is what [`TSocket::local_open`](../blob/0.9.1/lib/cpp/src/thrift/transport/TSocket.cpp#L342) is doing to do client-side winsock2 initialization.\n\nAs for the multiple-servers concern proposed by @henrique , `TWinsockSingleton` uses [`boost::call_once`/`std::call_once`](../blob/0.9.1/lib/cpp/src/thrift/windows/TWinsockSingleton.cpp#L61) to ensure thread-safe one-time initialization, so no worry.\n\nAs to the build error, after a quick glance at the build log:\n\n```\n...\n$ sudo apt-get install -qq php5-dev php5-cli phpunit\nFailed to fetch

Sure @guoyalun version looks cleaner.\n\n@guoyalun did I miss something, whats your opinion to the differences?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/48805552/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/48805568","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/151#issuecomment-48805568","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/151","id":48805568,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4ODA1NTY4","user":{"login":"drobakowski","id":81381,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81381?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drobakowski","html_url":"https://github.com/drobakowski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drobakowski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drobakowski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drobakowski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drobakowski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drobakowski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drobakowski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drobakowski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drobakowski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drobakowski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-12T08:17:35Z","updated_at":"2014-07-12T08:17:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"see #150\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/48805568/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/48945607","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/156#issuecomment-48945607","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/156","id":48945607,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4OTQ1NjA3","user":{"login":"kishorvpatil","id":6090397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwOTAzOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6090397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishorvpatil","html_url":"https://github.com/kishorvpatil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishorvpatil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishorvpatil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishorvpatil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishorvpatil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishorvpatil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishorvpatil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishorvpatil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishorvpatil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishorvpatil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-14T19:09:58Z","updated_at":"2014-07-14T19:09:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Please let me know your comments on improved improved thrift function.
