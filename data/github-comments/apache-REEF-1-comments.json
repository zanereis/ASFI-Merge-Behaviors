In Surf, evaluators try to notify the cache status and the driver updates its metadata. But it could yield a large complexity in case user wants to notify/handle multiple type of events. \n\nAs @bgchun mentioned, it is little bit unnatural to enumerate all the information to send in one TaskMessageSource and trigger the whole message with all the information written in it. Instead, I think it would be more intuitive if user can specify the exact message to notify when he/she wants to trigger the heartbeat.

There are a couple of concerns that a solution to the JIRA would have that this doesn't (or I don't see it):\n1. Each runtime binds a few things within the Driver Configuration as part of the job submission. See for a (terrifying) example `YarnJobSubmissionHandler.makeDriverConfiguration`. These settings wouldn't be made in the above approach. I think we need an API extension for runtimes that allows us to get a `Configuration` they'd like to have merged into the Driver `Configuration` to address this. If there is an easier way, I am all for it. If not, we should track that as a separate JIRA.\n2. The Driver ID is made `Optional` here for syntactic convenience while it in reality is very much `required`. Depending on how we choose to solve this, this will require another PR just for that.\n3. The factoring of the code is odd. This isn't a problem with this PR, but with the code it touches. And that code took its choices from the ancient distributed shell example. Given that this is going to be our \"clean\" story for this for the future, it seems wise to rectify this along the way.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/65921945/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/66238590","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/31#issuecomment-66238590","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/31","id":66238590,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2MjM4NTkw","user":{"login":"jwang98052","id":5666504,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NjY1MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5666504?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052","html_url":"https://github.com/jwang98052","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-09T05:58:46Z","updated_at":"2014-12-09T05:58:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"In this PR,  we don’t really refactor the existing bridge Launch and JobClient.  I think it should be in a separate PR. After this PR is updated based on the code review, it ends up two classes, one is DriverConfigCreator which contains main program, the other is DriverConfigBuilder which is mainly for calling serialization and create configuration files. \n\nThis PR is to address issue #54 which has three goals: \n\n1.Create driver configurations that contain java bindings only. This PR uses the same java bridge configuration data as today and removed those which are set from .Net side. Our clients are using this bridge config when submitting jobs. \n1. Make HttpServer and NameServer config as separate configurations so that clients can decide if they want to merge it instead of hard coded and mandatory\n2. Make driver skeleton configuration creation as part of the project build process\n\nWe do have a lot to revisit such as what shall we really need to put into Java driver configuration especially for runtime configurations, what parameters that .Net client should bind, etc. I think those can be in separate PRs. This PR is to set up an infrastructure to generate java side configuration for bridge clients. The configuration created by this PR would result in the same bindings as the clients are using today. It doesn’t make things worse but move a step further. We can then look at the binding data in the configuration and improve it. \n\nYes, required parameter for driver identifier is still open. As you suggested, we can assign an unique one in JobSubmissionHelper if default value is detected. It is understood we do want to use required parameter to enforce compile time injection error. But for the identifier, if the user doesn’t provide, we assign an unique one, that won’t cause any runtime error anyway, right? \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/66238590/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/66238813","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/31#issuecomment-66238813","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/31","id":66238813,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2MjM4ODEz","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-09T06:02:44Z","updated_at":"2014-12-09T06:02:44Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[Reef-pull-request-ubuntu #151](https://builds.apache.org/job/Reef-pull-request-ubuntu/151/) SUCCESS\nThis pull request looks good\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/66238813/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
