I am testing if tuning more trials could make the result more intuitive, I would like to first ask for the feedbacks about the naming. Here are my thoughts based on Tianqi's comments.\r\n\r\n- select.py -> pass.py\r\nAs suggested, this module is more like a pass over a set of tasks, so we can treat it as a pass. I can implement it as a pass table so that we can add other passes in the future.\r\n\r\n- Select representative tasks. Origianl: `autotvm.task.mark_depend(tasks)`\r\nWith the pass implemented above, this API becomes `autotvm.task.pass.FindReference(tasks)`, meaning that this pass is going to find the reference task for each task.\r\n\r\n- task.depend -> task.cfg_ref_task\r\n`cfg_ref_task` points to the task that we can refer its tuned configs when tuning. \r\n\r\n- tuner.depend_mode -> tuner.cfg_ref_mode\r\n`cfg_ref_mode` is a string in the `<mode>-<cfg>` format. `<mode>` can be either \"only\" or \"start\"; while `<cfg>` can be either \"topN\" or \"N%\". Here are some examples:\r\n    - \"only-top10\": Stop tuning after trying the top 10 configs in the `cfg_ref_task`.\r\n    - \"start-5%\": First try the top 5% configs in the `cfg_ref_task` and back to the normal tuning.\r\n    - The default is set to \"only-top10\", meaning that we will stop tuning after 10 trials if the task we are tuning has a tuned reference task.\r\n\r\n@kevinthesun @eqy @icemelon9 please let me know what you guys think about these names, and you're welcome to propose better ones. Thanks.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/548992976/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/549016509","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4238#issuecomment-549016509","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4238","id":549016509,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0OTAxNjUwOQ==","user":{"login":"MarisaKirisame","id":3397377,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzOTczNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3397377?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame","html_url":"https://github.com/MarisaKirisame","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-02T06:45:02Z","updated_at":"2019-11-02T06:45:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"You

Please see my responses and let me know what you think.\r\n\r\n* In the current proposal, user can manually specify the depdendency by `task.depend = rep_task`, and the user can implement any function to do so. On the other hand, we can also make it as a callback function like `autotvm.task.mark_depend(tasks, user_callback)`, but it raises concerns about the user callback function signature:\r\n\r\n1. If we define a distance function is a function that returns the distance (in any metric) of any two tasks (`callback(tasks: List[Task]) -> List[List[Float]]`), it is still unclear how should we group them.\r\n\r\n2. If we directly let user pass a callback function to group tasks (`callback(tasks: List[Task]) -> None`), it functions exactly the same as `mark_depend`, so it seems redundent.\r\n\r\nBased on the concerns, I'll prefer the current solution, and we can revisit it in the future when we have a more concrete idea about task pass.\r\n\r\n* New names based on your suggestions:\r\n  * task.depend -> task.share_from\r\n  * tuner.depend_mode -> tuner.share_mode\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/549516927/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/549553057","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/4087#issuecomment-549553057","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4087","id":549553057,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0OTU1MzA1Nw==","user":{"login":"petrex","id":699903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5OTkwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/699903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/petrex","html_url":"https://github.com/petrex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petrex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petrex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petrex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petrex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petrex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petrex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petrex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petrex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petrex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-04T21:22:43Z","updated_at":"2019-11-04T21:22:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@t-vi

for the PR.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if you can propose a separate PR for the ```runtime/contrib``` support.  Given that the runtime itself can be quite interesting and we want to have a clear guide for it.\r\n\r\nThe main problem I see in the current PR is that that the serialization is not implemented.\r\n\r\nYou can run things through relay.execute because the runtime is created on the fly. However, you cannot save the module, because SaveBinary and load method is not implemented for DNNLModule.\r\n\r\nMoreover, if we are only generating c code, I think a better way would be to reuse DSOModule, e.g. to generate wrapper functions in C that directly adopts the PackedFunc calling convention in the DSOModule, then the code can be collectively compiled with the original source, and still exposes these functions. Have a specific shell code Module(DNNL, and GCC) adds additional duplications that we do not need.\r\n\r\nA better example I have in mind could be something like a subgraph sequence in a serialized format(which can be used in save-binary), and then the PackedFunc interprets the graph and run things.

I will make the cpp_rpc use `libtvm_runtime.so`, not `libtvm.so`, which shouldn't need C++11 too much. However, I haven't required cpp_rpc should use C++03, so in cpp_rpc's code, we still have `std::to_string`, `auto` and so on. unluckily, I am in the open source process of our BU, so I plan to keep it using C++11 currently and could modify the code to C++03 next.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/550119753/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/550168689","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4235#issuecomment-550168689","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4235","id":550168689,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MDE2ODY4OQ==","user":{"login":"KimBioInfoStudio","id":22641519,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjQxNTE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22641519?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KimBioInfoStudio","html_url":"https://github.com/KimBioInfoStudio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KimBioInfoStudio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KimBioInfoStudio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KimBioInfoStudio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KimBioInfoStudio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KimBioInfoStudio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KimBioInfoStudio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KimBioInfoStudio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KimBioInfoStudio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KimBioInfoStudio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-06T06:40:20Z","updated_at":"2019-11-06T06:40:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Hi\r\n> \r\n> This PR cannot pass the CI build process due to following issue, but I am not sure whether it is caused by this PR or not, I would appreciate if you can give me suggestions, thanks.\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> docker/bash.sh tvmai/ci-cpu:v0.54 ./tests/scripts/task_build.sh build -j2\r\n> \r\n> [ 22%] Generating ../python/tvm/relay/grammar/py3/RelayVisitor.py, ../python/tvm/relay/grammar/py3/RelayParser.py, ../python/tvm/relay/grammar/py3/RelayLexer.py\r\n> \r\n> /bin/sh: 1: /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin/java -jar /usr/local/lib/antlr-4.7.1-complete.jar: not found\r\n> \r\n> make[2]: *** [../python/tvm/relay/grammar/py3/RelayVisitor.py] Error 127\r\n> \r\n> CMakeFiles/relay_parser.dir/build.make:62: recipe for target '../python/tvm/relay/grammar/py3/RelayVisitor.py' failed\r\n> \r\n> CMakeFiles/Makefile2:660: recipe for target 'CMakeFiles/relay_parser.dir/all' failed\r\n> \r\n> make[1]: *** [CMakeFiles/relay_parser.dir/all] Error 2\r\n> \r\n> make[1]: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nHi @cchung100m only this problem  only  affect  cmake func ``` message( ) ```, and @tqchen have fix this problem several days ago , so I think that  you can close this PR now.\r\n[[CI] use llvm9 for the gpu tests #4224](https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/pull/4224/files)\r\nCC : @soiferj what o u think , shoud we close this PR?

I can make a alter-layout change for NHWC network to use NCHW spatial schedule.
