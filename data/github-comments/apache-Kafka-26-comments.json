With respect to the first category, I think that in general their computational topologies will likely not include stateful processors and therefore partitioning might not be useful.\n\nIt is good to consider how or if we expose partitioning to these users. This PR introduces partitioning via two aspects:\n1. `TopologyBuilder.addSink(...)` has two overloaded forms: one that does not mention partitioning whatsoever, and another that takes a `StreamPartitioner`.\n2. The `StreamParttioner` interface.\n\nPersonally, I think that this has minimal impact on these \"computational\" users, but we can mitigate it even more by making sure the JavaDoc explains this succinctly and mentions that in most cases they wont have to worry about it and Kafka will automatically handle this correctly. I can change this PR to make this improvement.\n\nHowever, should any Kafka users want or need to use partitioning, this PR makes it incredibly easier to do. In fact, it makes it far easier for framework developer users because they can specify or control partitioning via the API.\n\nNow, what if the Kafka Streams API does not expose partitioning in any way, as is currently the case with `master`? Then is it even practical for \"computational\" users to use state stores in their topologies? Perhaps so, but only if they use a single partition. (And now they have to learn about partitioning.) So in effect, \"computational\" users can really only use part of the existing Kafka Streams API if they're not going to learn about partitioning. Do the proposed changes really introduce that big of a change in what these users are expected to learn?\n\nTo summarize, I think the proposed changes (with some JavaDoc improvements) affect \"computational\" users in a very minor way, and does not _require_ them to learn or use partitioning. Any _if_ they read Kafka documentation and do learn about partitioning, the proposed changes make this incredibly easier for them to try or use it than with the existing global partitioning mechanism (which I didn't learn about for more months than I'd like to admit).\n\nI will rebase this PR and update the JavaDoc as mentioned for your further evaluation.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/156461690/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/156479657","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/511#issuecomment-156479657","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/511","id":156479657,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NjQ3OTY1Nw==","user":{"login":"junrao","id":132330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjMzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/132330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-13T16:27:20Z","updated_at":"2015-11-13T16:27:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the patch.

However, there is one particular point that I'm not happy about currently. I was initially extending `KafkaServerTestHarness`, but I couldn't make it work because the setup needs to be done so that ZK starts first, then we set a cluster ACL, and only after setting the ACL we can start the brokers. At least this is the sequence that worked for me and I couldn't manage to simply rely on the `setUp` call in `KafkaServerTestHarness`. Consequently, there is a bit of duplication that we should be able to remove by changing `KafkaServerTestHarness` to be more security friendly.

To solve the group load/unload ordering problem, I did the following:\n1. Refactored GroupMetadataManager to use a single-thread scheduler.\n2. Moved the work of removeGroupsForPartition into the scheduler.\n3. Passed through the controller/leader epochs to ensure proper ordering of loading/unloading.\n\nThe use of the single-thread scheduler seems unfortunate, but we already had a global lock for loading partitions, so it's not too bad. In fact, it's probably better not to tie up additional threads if everything has to be synchronized anyway.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/157298268/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/157319326","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/538#issuecomment-157319326","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/538","id":157319326,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NzMxOTMyNg==","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-17T09:33:23Z","updated_at":"2015-11-17T09:33:40Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@granders, it looks like you removed the SASL logging in the last commit.

To do the authorization, we need to compare principals of the same type and KafkaPrincipal and Principal are not directly comparable.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/157403388/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/157417515","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/541#issuecomment-157417515","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/541","id":157417515,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NzQxNzUxNQ==","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-17T16:15:12Z","updated_at":"2015-11-17T16:15:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for the explanation.

I think the question is whether a reordering can occur between the time becomeLeaderOrFollower() exits and the time the load/unload tasks are scheduled and executed. As long as we can guarantee that calls to schedule() are called in the correct order, it looks like we can depend on the scheduler to ensure the expected order of execution. Since the server does not permit concurrent handling of requests from the same controller, it seems like that guarantee holds, so I think it might be sufficient to check only the controller epoch.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/157472272/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/157472844","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/545#issuecomment-157472844","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/545","id":157472844,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NzQ3Mjg0NA==","user":{"login":"Parth-Brahmbhatt","id":6914358,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MTQzNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6914358?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt","html_url":"https://github.com/Parth-Brahmbhatt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-17T19:07:24Z","updated_at":"2015-11-17T19:08:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@junrao The more I interact with the CLI I also feel it might be better to collapse allow-host, allow-principal, deny-host and deny-principal into allow/deny, principal, host. \n\nI originally thought because Deny is suppose to be a negation operation most users would want to specify deny and allow in the same CLI command, which is why I proposed the original config options. However I feel deny is a special use case which will be very rarely used. \n\nOverall I feel: \n\"kafka-acl.sh --add --allow --principal alice --host host1\" reads better than\n\"kafka-acl.sh --add --allow-principal alice --allow-host host1\" with the downside of not being able to provide both allow and deny options in the single command.\n\nIf you agree I can make changes to both code, documentation and KIP before EOD.
