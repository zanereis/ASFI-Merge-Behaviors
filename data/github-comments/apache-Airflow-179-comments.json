Are you sure you want to work on this in parallel to our work :)? We are just about to get merged (with @sprzedwojski ) all the create/update/delete/query operators for Cloud Spanner for Databases and Instances: \r\n\r\nThose are the three issues affected: \r\n\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3310\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3398\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3480\r\n\r\nThe first one is in review already and the two are just about to get PR (we have the code merged and tested - including system tests with real Spanner instances). That also includes all operators, example dags and full documentation in docstrings.\r\n\r\nI guess you can take a look at our code and see if it also works for you?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/444927988/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/444939775","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4287#issuecomment-444939775","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4287","id":444939775,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NDkzOTc3NQ==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-06T16:41:36Z","updated_at":"2018-12-07T23:56:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/4287?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#4287](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/4287?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/commit/788bd6fcb35ce6354ae874a508772e58a850683e?src=pr&el=desc) will **increase** coverage by `<.01%`.\n> The diff coverage is `100%`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/4287/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=WdLKlKHOAU&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/4287?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@            Coverage Diff             @@\n##           master    #4287      +/-   ##\n==========================================\n+ Coverage   78.08%   78.08%   +<.01%     \n==========================================\n  Files         201      201              \n  Lines       16462    16464       +2     \n==========================================\n+ Hits        12854    12856       +2     \n  Misses       3608     3608\n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/4287?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [airflow/api/common/experimental/delete\\_dag.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/4287/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9hcGkvY29tbW9uL2V4cGVyaW1lbnRhbC9kZWxldGVfZGFnLnB5) | `88% <100%> (+5.39%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [airflow/models.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/4287/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9tb2RlbHMucHk=) | `92.3% <0%> (-0.05%)` | :arrow_down: |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/4287?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/4287?src=pr&el=footer).
