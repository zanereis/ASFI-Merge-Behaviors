I think what you are saying is can be summarized in:\r\na) The StorageRewrite pass does not solve our problem because it can still touch the output buffers (which are parameters of the `tir PrimFunc`)\r\nb) The solution that we have put in place in `StorageRewrite` does not address the reference counting in an general way. \r\n\r\nAbout a), I disagree. `StorageRewrite` only rewrites `tir.Allocate` nodes, and the output is not allocated in our main runner function. This is why if you run mobilenet quantized with the `StorageRewrite` pass, it works (and it doesn't work with Graph Memory Planning). So `StorageRewrite` is a perfectly good candidate to solve the issue we have in #8062 . The problem with `StorageRewrite `is that it doesn't handle `tvm_struct_set` correctly, and this brings us to point b)\r\n\r\nAbout b), I agree. The solution we are proposing is not general, but any general solution can be built on top of it. As you said, we are trying to solve a specific case, but when you tackle the general case, the code I wrote is still valid. Especially in a TIR based world (which is the aim of TensorIR, afaiu) I think we will want (at some point) to extend this solution instead of accepting  that `StorageRewrite` does not work with some TIR built-ins. \r\n\r\nIn other words, our solution is not tailored to AOT at all. It is a partial solution to a generic problem that (only) AOT is hitting (for now). It cannot break anything in the future, because either the user is doing what AOT is doing, and it will work. For more edge cases, `StorageRewrite` won't work as it didn't use to work before. \r\n\r\nBear also in mind that until we have a static memory planner, without this solution AOT is not usable. If you want, we can try to write a test that stresses the problem we are trying to solve with the change in `StorageRewrite`. \r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/859519657/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/859527557","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7858#issuecomment-859527557","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7858","id":859527557,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg1OTUyNzU1Nw==","user":{"login":"mbaret","id":55580676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTgwNjc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55580676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret","html_url":"https://github.com/mbaret","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-11T11:53:43Z","updated_at":"2021-06-11T11:53:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This is now merged.
