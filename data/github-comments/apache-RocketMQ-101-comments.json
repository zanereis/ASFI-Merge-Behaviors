It can be ensured that sequential consumer for each queue is static，and Load-balancing will not cause consumer to be replaced for one queue .\r\n\r\nIf you mean \"other consume thread in one consumer\", please pay attention to the synchronized lock in `ConsumeRequest`.\r\n```\r\nfinal Object objLock = messageQueueLock.fetchLockObject(this.messageQueue);\r\nsynchronized (objLock) {\r\n       ....\r\n       status = messageListener.consumeMessage(Collections.unmodifiableList(msgs), context);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis ensures that only one ConsumeRequest thread can consume messages in each queue at the same time. When the message is consumed, it will be removed from ProcessQueue, seeing `org.apache.rocketmq.client.impl.consumer.ProcessQueue#takeMessages`. Therefore, it won't happen that another thread repeatedly consume the message.

It seems like the `objLock` is enough. @guyinyou @panzhi33 can you help confirm this?\r\n> \r\n> [use of comsumeLock](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/blob/e3b67484b0ea3172cf0555e39efe36c0030c53b3/client/src/main/java/org/apache/rocketmq/client/impl/consumer/ConsumeMessageOrderlyService.java#L490-L508)\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst ： i mean \" other consumer process \", not \"other consume thread in one consumer \"\r\n\r\nSecond :  I am wrong . my proposal is wrong. \r\n\r\nThere is no need to place the release of the ProcessQueue lock after the commit consume offset. Because the offset  submitted in ConsumeRequest is only submitted to the local memory, the offset is not actually submitted to the Broker.\r\n\r\nTherefore, there is no essential difference between the release of the ProcessQueue lock after the listener processes the message and after the offset is submitted in the ConsumeRequest. Neither case actually commits the offset to the Broker.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThird, I think ProcessQueue lock does the following:\r\nThe lock of ProcessQueue is used to represent a state: that is, there are messages being processed in the current ProcessQueue. \r\n\r\nWhen RebalanceImpl thread  reassigns the MessageQueue, if the MessageQueue no longer belongs to the sequential consumer ,\r\nThen you need to send a request to the Broker to release the lock of the MessageQueue, but if a message is being consumed by the current consumer, after the MessageQueue is released, the consumers of other processes obtain the MessageQueue, and then pull the message consumption from it, which will\r\nCauses a MessageQueue to be consumed by two process Consumers at the same time. \r\n\r\nWhen we have ProcessQueue lock, after the reallocation, the current Consumer will check the lock status of the ProcessQueue when releasing the lock of the MessageQueue. If the ProcessQueue is locked, the release of the lock of the current MessageQueue will be delayed.\r\n\r\n\r\nFourth: Based on the third point of discussion, I am more puzzled about why we use consumeLock(ReentranceLock) in ProcessQueue to represent this state, instead of simply using volatile boolean\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1086543695/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1086578825","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/4074#issuecomment-1086578825","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/4074","id":1086578825,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl85Aw-CJ","user":{"login":"Hen1ng","id":72974271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyOTc0Mjcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72974271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hen1ng","html_url":"https://github.com/Hen1ng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hen1ng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hen1ng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hen1ng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hen1ng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hen1ng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hen1ng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hen1ng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hen1ng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hen1ng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-02T07:44:28Z","updated_at":"2022-04-02T07:44:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"有一这个putRequestAndReturnMappedFile这个方法一次put两个到请求队列中，可能线程处理到第二个请求的时候发生了异常hasException置为true，这时候再次调用putRequestAndReturnMappedFile这个方法的时候，就会返回null，这个是期望的吗","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1086578825/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1086602168","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/4101#issuecomment-1086602168","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/4101","id":1086602168,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl85AxDu4","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-02T09:37:59Z","updated_at":"2022-04-02T09:48:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#
