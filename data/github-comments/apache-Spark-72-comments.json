Hey Andrew, the merge with the master is a little involved. There is an extra handler being added to the JobProgressUI (which now is JobProgressTab) which does not translate cleanly through the refactoring. So I leave it up to you to do the merging (I dont want to break anything accidentally). Also, a new suite was added SparkUISuite, and its best to merge the UISuite and SparkUISuite to prevent further confusion.

I encountered a problem just now. I have 20,000 files and call `wholeTextFiles(dir)` without setting `mapreduce.input.fileinputformat.split.max.size`, then I get 1 partition for 20, 000 files, which causes my program too slow!\n\nUsers usually ignore to set the java property, or even have no idea of that. Then I think it is better to provide the `NewHadoopAPI` with `minSplits`, not just `wholeTextFiles`. But due to the complexity to set the `maxSplitSize` in `NewHadoopAPI`, I think the best way is to find out all the unique ways to set `maxSplitSize` and use a pattern matching to set them w.r.t. different input formats.\n\nFor newly defined input formats, such as `WholeTextFilesInputFormat`, developer should keep it the same with its parent class.

Might be best to really fix this up per Mridul's suggestion to use `Seq[ByteBuffer]`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/40275465/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/40276213","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/397#issuecomment-40276213","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/397","id":40276213,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMjc2MjEz","user":{"login":"mridulm","id":1591700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTE3MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1591700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm","html_url":"https://github.com/mridulm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-12T09:36:24Z","updated_at":"2014-04-12T09:38:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I actually meant something like this:\n(This is from an internal WIP branch to tackle the ByteBuffer to Seq[ByteBuffer])\nIdeally I should submit this via a PR, but unfortunately, but ...\n\nPlease take a look at needCompact and toByteBuffer (replace direct creation of ByteBuffer from byte array with this method).\nIdea is to potentially waste some memory to prevent memory fragmentation and/or copy.\n\n```\npackage org.apache.spark.io\n\nimport java.io.OutputStream\nimport java.nio.ByteBuffer\nimport java.util.{Arrays => JArrays}\nimport org.apache.spark.storage.DiskStore\n\n/**\n * A custom implementation of ByteArrayOutputStream which tries to minimize array copies by\n * reusing the underlying array if within bounds.\n *\n * Note, this is unsafe for general use : directly exposed the data array for use.\n *\n */\nprivate[io] class SparkByteArrayOutputStream(initialSize: Int) extends OutputStream {\n\n  if (initialSize < 0) {\n    throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Negative initial size: \" + initialSize)\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * The buffer where data is stored.\n   */\n  private var buf: Array[Byte] = new Array[Byte](initialSize)\n  /**\n   * The number of valid bytes in the buffer.\n   */\n  private var count: Int = 0\n\n  /**\n   * Creates a new byte array output stream.

Apologies if I'm stating the obvious.\n\nThe management of the byte array here is not what's solving the immediate problem. Where this stuff is used in the code, the calling code wants to write N bytes in pieces, and then get a `byte[]` of exactly N bytes. Except in the lucky case that N exactly matched the buffer size, this entails an allocation and copy. Previously this was hidden in a `trim()` method. The `compact()` method would not work directly since it can result in an underlying array of more than N bytes.\n\nWhat's needed is an abstraction that can take a `byte[]` that's possibly too large, and a limit N, and broker access in a way that makes it act like it is only of length N, without a copy.\n\nAlthough this is not `ByteBuffer`'s primarily role in life, it can kind of play that role. You can wrap bytes 0 to N of a `byte[]` without a copy. And it has methods to read through the elements of the buffer. Note that its `array()` method itself does not copy, but, also provides access to the whole maybe-too-large array underneath.\n\nFor that reason, and because calling code in one case already wants a `ByteBuffer`, this feels like a good solution. However, other callers need to change to use `ByteBuffer` if they care about the allocation. So there's more to this than just a drop-in replacement.\n\nHowever I'd also say that this doesn't need reimplementing `ByteArrayOutputStream` so entirely. Just subclass it and expose a `toByteBuffer()` method that `wrap()`s the internal `byte[]` with an appropriate limit.\n\nI understand the idea of this code is to implement a compaction mechanism, but that's a separate issue really. (When does this help? I understand it can free up some heap, at the cost of a new second allocation and copy, and could be helpful if this object were sticking around a long time. But it's not, right?)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/40277866/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/40278958","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/397#issuecomment-40278958","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/397","id":40278958,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMjc4OTU4","user":{"login":"mridulm","id":1591700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTE3MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1591700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm","html_url":"https://github.com/mridulm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-12T12:17:33Z","updated_at":"2014-04-12T12:21:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Your summarization is fairly accurate @srowen except for two cases :\n- compact method is not expected to resize the array always : only when the free space is deemed too high.

More below on why this is important (stream of boas case).\n\nTo add, my initial approach was to subclass ByteArrayOutputStream to minimize code :-)\nThe reason why I moved away from it was because I did not want to expose the toByteArray method : to prevent current/future accidental invocation of that (expensive) method.\nNot to mention, a bunch of other methods which actually wont work (more below) in our context.\n\nBefore going into details, please note that the main purpose of this stream is to actually get a ByteBuffer out of the data which is subsequently used - which need not span the entire byte[]- can can work within a region of it.\n\nAnd what is not mentioned above is that the actual use of this class is within another class which multiplexes over these baos instances - so that we are not limited to 2Gb limit : we have an Sequence of these streams : which will be read in order to get to the actual data (the wrapper OutputStream moves from first to next as required; and returns a Seq[ByteBuffer] when we are done writing to it).\nWhich is why most of the methods wont work - reset, close, toByteArray, toString : since the output stream is not starting at a data boundary : but inside the context of a larger stream.
