I've been fighting against the nulling-out of instance variables like this forever. It's always causing NPEs for unsuspecting programmers who don't recognize that this anti-pattern is being used. The instance variable ought to be \"final\" and some other state should be added and consulted to see if the connection table has been closed.\r\n\r\nHi @bschuchardt , \r\nI think that the best way is to make this threadConnectionMap final and change this `close()` to iterate over the map, close all connections and clear map. In this way, we don't need these null checks.\r\nWriting it to local map and then execute command on it isn't good as `computeIfAbsent()` can throw NPE as we didn't know if someone deleted it as we are checking our local copy.

Briefly:\r\n- Java version numbers appear in two contexts: As system requirements and as strings in examples.\r\n- Use of Java versions in system requirements prompted the current two-part division of the variables into main-version and minimum-update. There are only a few occurrences of these, but the variables ensure that they roll in sync with new releases.\r\n- Java versions in examples are scattered throughout the User Guide. This PR addresses 10 of these, but there are almost certainly more. In addition, you can see from the diffs that there are adjacent lines containing hard-coded Java info (\"Java version:   1.0.0 user1 041216 2016-11-12 11:18:37 -0700\") that are likely out-of-date. Identifying and variable-izing all such occurrences is way beyond the scope of this JIRA ticket.\r\n\r\nMy recommendation is to accept @alb3rtobr 's current solution as a good step in the right direction.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/558244555/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/558281949","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/4370#issuecomment-558281949","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/4370","id":558281949,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1ODI4MTk0OQ==","user":{"login":"jdeppe-pivotal","id":5313410,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMTM0MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5313410?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/jdeppe-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-25T18:29:49Z","updated_at":"2019-11-25T18:29:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jmelchio For your review","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/558281949/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/558307150","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/4370#issuecomment-558307150","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/4370","id":558307150,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1ODMwNzE1MA==","user":{"login":"lgtm-com[bot]","id":43144390,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDMxNDQzOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/17324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/lgtm-com","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-25T19:34:57Z","updated_at":"2019-11-25T19:34:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This pull request **introduces 1 alert** and **fixes 2** when merging 4ddc6c9999eac4cbc618d0f330ad0db292ed077a into d000cb8a9af140382da66745e18c49dbcef6f9ff -

In fact, I don't even think we should check for the nullity of the `QueryConfigurationService` in the first place as it should always be created by default [here](https://github.com/apache/geode/blob/develop/geode-core/src/main/java/org/apache/geode/internal/cache/GemFireCacheImpl.java#L1264-L1276).\r\nIn order to have more control about which methods should be allowed during an OQL execution, users must implement the `MethodInvocationAuthorizer` interface and use the configuration options we provide; they should never implement the `QueryConfigurationService` directly as it has nothing to do with the actual authorization, its purpose is to control how the query engine is configured. The `QueryConfigurationService` interface is internal and was never meant to be implemented by users at all. They can dig in the code, find the interface, implement it, and manage themselves to override the default service implementation, sure, but that would require some work and access to the actual file system on which Geode is running to \"hack\" the default service declaration within the `META-INF/services` directory, in which case we can't do nothing about it either.\r\nI'm happy to discuss more about this, I see the following options moving forward:\r\n\r\n- Leave things as they are, checking only the nullity of the `QueryConfigurationService` itself to make sure users don't put themselves into a bad situation by manually messing around with the classpath.\r\n- Revert my [last commit on this PR](https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/4369/commits/def003221edaefa1faf606bafe70c6bc37c687cc) and leave things as they originally were, that is, don't check for the nullity of `QueryConfigurationService` nor for `QueryConfigurationService.getMethodInvocationAuthorizer()`. This assumes that our users will never implement `QueryConfigurationService`, which is expected as this interface is internal.\r\n- Make `QueryConfigurationService` an internal service, not externally configurable through the `ServiceLoader` mechanism. This would guarantee that only our implementation is used, and avoid returning `null`.\r\n- A mix of the above 3 options: leave the `QueryConfigurationService` externally configurable through the `ServiceLoader` mechanism but also make it a \"special service\" in the sense that, [during cache initialization](https://github.com/apache/geode/blob/develop/geode-core/src/main/java/org/apache/geode/internal/cache/GemFireCacheImpl.java#L1264-L1276), we throw an exception whenever either the service instance or the returned `MethodInvocationAuthorizer` by the instance are `null`.\r\n\r\n@DonalEvans @BenjaminPerryRoss : I might be missing something here, thoughts?.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/558826355/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/558867341","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/4364#issuecomment-558867341","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/4364","id":558867341,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1ODg2NzM0MQ==","user":{"login":"Bill","id":4002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill","html_url":"https://github.com/Bill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-26T23:56:55Z","updated_at":"2019-11-26T23:56:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"`DistributedTestOpenJDK11` latest CI run failed but I believe it is due to a CI infrastructure problem.

See [`CqServiceImpl.evaluateQuery`](https://github.com/apache/geode/blob/develop/geode-cq/src/main/java/org/apache/geode/cache/query/cq/internal/CqServiceImpl.java#L1604-L1607) and [`ExecutionContext.reset`](https://github.com/apache/geode/blob/develop/geode-core/src/main/java/org/apache/geode/cache/query/internal/ExecutionContext.java#L587-L591).\r\n\r\n> If they have the old authorizer, why do we need to clear the cache?\r\n\r\nIf we don't clear the cache, the CQ won't be evaluated for those keys that are part of the cache, which can result in invoking `onEvent` instead of `onError` for the associated `CqListener`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs an example, let's say the user has the CQ  `SELECT * from /testRegion object WHERE object.getId() > -1` running in the cluster, the configured `MethodInvocationAuthorizer` allows `getId` to be invoked. Some time passes and the CQ internal cache builds up to improve performance.\r\nAt that point the user decides to install a new `MethodInvocationAuthorizer` that doesn't allow `getId`. If we don't invalidate the internal CQ cache, the engine will invoke `onError` for events **that are not part of the internal cache** (the CQ will be executed) and `onEvent` for those events that **that are part of the internal cache** (the CQ won't be executed), which is not consistent.\r\nLong story short, by invalidating the internal cache we make sure the CQ will be re-executed for every event  no matter what, and the execution itself will result in error if the newly configured authorizer doesn't allow the execution of methods present in the CQ expression.\r\nHope it makes sense now, please let me know your thoughts.\r\nCheers.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/561563779/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/561886998","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/4422#issuecomment-561886998","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/4422","id":561886998,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MTg4Njk5OA==","user":{"login":"yozaner1324","id":10576409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTc2NDA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10576409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yozaner1324","html_url":"https://github.com/yozaner1324","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yozaner1324/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yozaner1324/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yozaner1324/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yozaner1324/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yozaner1324/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yozaner1324/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yozaner1324/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yozaner1324/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yozaner1324/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-04T23:21:32Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T23:21:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This initial PR contains two commits.

Putting that method into `IndexType` makes the mapping part of the public API.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/562625911/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/563172853","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/4387#issuecomment-563172853","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/4387","id":563172853,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MzE3Mjg1Mw==","user":{"login":"mivanac","id":48509724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NTA5NzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48509724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivanac","html_url":"https://github.com/mivanac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivanac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivanac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivanac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivanac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivanac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivanac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivanac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivanac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivanac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-09T10:39:44Z","updated_at":"2019-12-09T10:39:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Added tests for new functionality.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/563172853/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/563388551","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/4445#issuecomment-563388551","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/4445","id":563388551,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MzM4ODU1MQ==","user":{"login":"jinmeiliao","id":15638418,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjM4NDE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15638418?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao","html_url":"https://github.com/jinmeiliao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-09T19:15:06Z","updated_at":"2019-12-09T19:15:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@jmelchio ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/563388551/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/563477040","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/4436#issuecomment-563477040","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/4436","id":563477040,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MzQ3NzA0MA==","user":{"login":"kirklund","id":1444301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDQzMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1444301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund","html_url":"https://github.com/kirklund","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-09T22:52:26Z","updated_at":"2019-12-09T22:52:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks like AnalyzeManagementSerializablesJUnitTest is failing on develop as well as this PR branch.
