If so and it does not end in 10 digits, what should be the behaviour?</p>\n\n<p>    For this scenario in `PersistentNode` we can be \"sure\" that it's sequential and hence it's probably reasonable (and more efficient) to omit the check. Given that curator has lasted this long without the need for such a method, I'm wondering whether having it is really warranted.

This empty array causes a `NullPointerException` to be thrown by my deserializer, or (if the empty case is handled there, returning `null` from the deserializer) causes a `NullPointerException` when the `null` instance is put in `instances` (a `ConcurrentMap`).\r\nThe implementation of `ServiceCacheImpl#addInstance` below is what resolved things for me, patched into the `4.0.1` release. The `if` at the open of the function is the only change. Just wanted to throw this out there, because I've only been able to resolve the issue by using this patch -- no dice on the current `master` branch.

concurrent pools. Since Deflaters and Inflaters are acquired and returned to the pools in try-finally blocks that are free of blocking calls themselves, it's not expected that the number of objects in the pools could exceed the number of hardware threads on the machine much. Therefore it's accepted to have simple pools of strongly-referenced objects.</p>\n\n<p>    Just an interesting cross project reference, similar task in Jetty: <a href=\"https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/issues/300\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/issues/300</a></p>\n\n<p>You can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:</p>\n\n<p>    $ git pull <a href=\"https://github.com/leventov/curator\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/leventov/curator</a> GzipCompressionProvider-references</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/curator/pull/282.patch\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/curator/pull/282.patch</a></p>\n\n<p>To close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch<br/>\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:</p>\n\n<p>    This closes #282</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>commit 6457f267ad713854fb89d32a56f266202cf82cd5<br/>\nAuthor: Roman Leventov <leventov.ru@...><br/>\nDate:   2018-11-30T17:49:10Z</p>\n\n<p>    Make GzipCompressionProvider to recycle Deflaters and Inflaters in pools</p>\n\n<hr />","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604770670/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604768277","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/curator/issues/992#issuecomment-2604768277","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/992","id":2604768277,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MDQ3NjgyNzc=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-01T15:59:20Z","updated_at":"2025-01-21T13:40:21Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=githubbot\">githubbot</a>:</i>\n<p>GitHub user Randgalt opened a pull request:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/curator/pull/283\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/curator/pull/283</a></p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CURATOR-472\" title=\"Test-only code started to be called in prod\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"CURATOR-472\"><del>CURATOR-472</del></a> - fix deadlocks during tests as well as TTL test issues</p>\n\n<p>    Fixed 2 problems: 1) internalClose can be called from a ZooKeeper background thread (as part of a Watcher callback).

Given that all replicas coordinating via zookeeper would use the identical token, this could conceivably lead to incorrect behavior when the protection logic is needed.</p>\n\n<p>    While I believe this PR fixes the bug, I'd really suggest a more comprehensive change to eliminate the `CreateBuilderImpl.doProtected` field entirely, instead relying upon `protectedId != null` to convey this intention. However, being unfamiliar with the nuances of the existing implementation, I didn't want to perform that surgery today. If you think that change seems preferable, I'd be happy to do that instead.</p>\n\n<p>You can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:</p>\n\n<p>    $ git pull <a href=\"https://github.com/joshng/curator\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/joshng/curator</a> <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CURATOR-489\" title=\"CreateOption.doProtected uses null protectedId when applied via AsyncCreateBuilderImpl\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"CURATOR-489\"><del>CURATOR-489</del></a>-set-protectedId</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/curator/pull/284.patch\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/curator/pull/284.patch</a></p>\n\n<p>To close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch<br/>\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:</p>\n\n<p>    This closes #284</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>commit 5c27ecc29c3503633462cd95971ceb6a91175404<br/>\nAuthor: josh gruenberg <joshgr@...><br/>\nDate:   2018-12-04T21:17:15Z</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CURATOR-489\" title=\"CreateOption.doProtected uses null protectedId when applied via AsyncCreateBuilderImpl\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"CURATOR-489\"><del>CURATOR-489</del></a>: CreateBuilderImpl assigns protectedId if doProtected is true</p>\n\n<hr />","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604770992/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604770878","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/curator/issues/1008#issuecomment-2604770878","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/1008","id":2604770878,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MDQ3NzA4Nzg=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-04T22:09:10Z","updated_at":"2025-01-21T13:41:25Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=borisd\">borisd</a>:</i>\n<p>You're right.
