What I'd love is some ability to say, \"For this sequence, store the value 1 in some global variable X.\" To do this, I was going to maybe use Redis, but I'd need a unique ID to store the value since I could have multiple activations at once. A unique sequence ID would do it.\r\n\r\np.s. Even better would be a new, second argument to OpenWhisk actions for context.

I'm confused by the description and the changes - thanks in advance for clarification. \r\n\r\nI would have expected an abstract interface for draining activation logs and a concrete implementation using the existing couchdb store. \r\n\r\nA word of caution: using docker logs to fetch logs is historically a recipe for docker daemon locks up and kernel panics. It doesn't work under load.
