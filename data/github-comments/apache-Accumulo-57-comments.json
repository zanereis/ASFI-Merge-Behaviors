The test can simply add a user that lacks the appropriate permission, and can verify that the appropriate AccumuloSecurityException denial is thrown if a flush is attempted.\r\n\r\n> I also noticed that in `PermissionsIT` that the test case for system permissions isn't actually there and is left as a to-do I assume. Not sure if there was a good reason why that was left undone.\r\n\r\nIt probably just wasn't in scope of the original issue. Maybe there's another test that checks those? It can be added to this one, if not.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/742524904/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/742533150","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/1832#issuecomment-742533150","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1832","id":742533150,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0MjUzMzE1MA==","user":{"login":"Manno15","id":29436247,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NDM2MjQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29436247?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manno15","html_url":"https://github.com/Manno15","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manno15/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manno15/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manno15/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manno15/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manno15/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manno15/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manno15/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manno15/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manno15/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-10T13:51:19Z","updated_at":"2020-12-10T13:51:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> There's no need to change any permissions.

Based on the exception, it seems you are missing commons-configuration on your class path. Without a full stack trace, it will be hard to determine which specific part of our code was looking for commons-configuration. However, if you put that on your class path, it should solve your problem. The tool.sh script was written to help add some things to your local class path, as well as the class path for the submitted MapReduce job. Perhaps it isn't picking up your commons-configuration jar? Or perhaps there's a conflict with the version that ships with Hadoop or ZooKeeper?\r\n\r\nIt looks like Accumulo 1.9.3 was built with commons-configuration 1.6, based on what we had in our pom.xml, but please note that 1.9.3 has been superseded by 1.10.0, and is no longer supported.\r\n\r\nI hope this response helps answer your question.

However that is the design of per-table properties and works as expected.\r\n\r\nBased on the discussion, though, it seems that this issue is not about table-specific properties overriding system properties, but specifically about the issues of HostRegexTableLoadBalancer poor use of properties. It should be mentioned that while these properties can be set at the per-table level (because of the property names and for historical reasons), this balancer cannot be used as a per-table balancer, and can only be instantiated at the main balancer (it has no per-table constructor that accepts a table id). The current code in the main branch was modified in #1201 (for target release 2.1.0) and never uses the per-table configuration for anything other than issue a warning. So, the only settings that will apply to this balancer are those placed on the system-wide configuration.\r\n\r\nGiven the state of things in the main branch, I don't believe there's anything more to be done here, other than to advise people to use this balancer very carefully... with the understanding that the properties should be set at the system level, in spite of their names (for historical reasons) being prefixed with `table.`\r\n\r\nPlease re-open or continue the discussion if there's more to address, but I think the fix in #1201 should address the concerns listed here already.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/744498482/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/744503096","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1838#issuecomment-744503096","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1838","id":744503096,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0NDUwMzA5Ng==","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-14T15:08:06Z","updated_at":"2020-12-14T15:08:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Duplicate of #1837 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/744503096/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/744586501","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/1834#issuecomment-744586501","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1834","id":744586501,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0NDU4NjUwMQ==","user":{"login":"milleruntime","id":11872539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODcyNTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11872539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime","html_url":"https://github.com/milleruntime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-14T17:18:56Z","updated_at":"2020-12-14T17:18:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"While this is change contains multiple enhancements to the cryptography in the code, I feel like this is a regression in the maintainability.

In general, constants should be as local as possible to the code where they get used. We have very little use of these as global constants.\r\n\r\n> Now the encryption is scattered across vastly different and obscure parts of the code (KeyExtent, VisMetricsGatherer, SystemCredentials and ZkSecurityTool).\r\n\r\nNo. It's not scattered. Addressing these point-by-point:\r\n\r\n1. KeyExtent and VisMetricsGatherer are not using this in any cryptographic way. It's just part of it's local serialization code... which can change independently of crypto-related stuff. If it changes, it'd be because made a design to change the way KeyExtent or VisMetricsGatherer serializes those objects... and not because of some system wide decision pertaining to cryptographic strength. We shouldn't use a global constant unless we're trying to enforce some system wide decision, but that's not the case for these two.\r\n\r\n2. For ZkSecurityTool, the only thing there now pertaining to SHA-256 is the code that allows us to read legacy formatted entries... which would not change based on any global decision. This should be local so that changes at a global level don't break our ability to read and convert legacy entries.\r\n\r\n3. There are no \"SHA-X\" constants in SystemCredentials now. There is a hard-coded constant for the salt prefix, because of a quirk with the way the commons-codec Crypt API works. We need to keep a consistent salt so that different servers don't generate different system passwords. Ideally, we'd always use the strongest hash supported by Crypt. We could programmatically extract the prefix associated with the strongest hash. However, I opted instead to create a JUnit test case to make us aware of any changes of that nature, so we can evaluate whether we need to use a different algorithm. Otherwise, it will just use SHA-512, which is Crypt's default.\r\n\r\nSo, really, there's no need for a centralized constant. The only uses for the constants we previously had are either non-crypto purpose serialization, code to interpret legacy values, or necessary to keep a consistent salt that only applies in one area of the code.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/744607968/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/744610558","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/1832#issuecomment-744610558","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1832","id":744610558,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0NDYxMDU1OA==","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-14T18:01:04Z","updated_at":"2020-12-14T18:01:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The following RPC calls were affected: initiateFlush, waitForFlush, shutdown, shutdownTabletServer, setMasterGoalState, setSystemProperty, and removeSystemProperty.

However that is the design of per-table properties and works as expected.\r\n\r\nNo, that is not what the issue is saying.  I tried to clarify it in the discussion but it seems further clarity is needed.  \r\nGiven a set of Tables T{T1, T2, ..., TN} and a set of configs C{C1,C2, ..., CN}, with some number of system-level properties S  with C1, C2, ... CN set, for a given table T1 with C1,..., CN set,   T1C1 can and does take precedence over SC1.  This is good, right, and proper.  The issue is (was) that there exists a set of properties with tablenames which can be set at both the system level and table level for each table, C.Tname.  When I say \"Individual table-specific properties are able to be overridden in *different* table contexts\"  I mean C.T1  could be overridden in T2 ( *different* tables meaning T1 !=  T2 ) in such a way that T1C.T1 and SC.T1 are ignored in favor of T2C.T1.  C.T1 should be specific to T1 and no table T not equal to T1 should be able to override it.  It sounds like #1201 addressed this so that SC.T1 would take precedence over all TC.T1 which fixes the specific issue with the HostRegexBalancer, but that violates the original idea that Tc should override Sc for all c in C.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/744631533/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/744635177","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/1834#issuecomment-744635177","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1834","id":744635177,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0NDYzNTE3Nw==","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-14T18:44:47Z","updated_at":"2020-12-14T18:44:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Thanks for addressing my concerns. I guess my only concern now is how to address future requirements, when the hashes get out of date. So if someone asks what hashes do we support, we just answer whatever the latest version we use of Apache commons Crypt library supports?\r\n\r\nWell, now that we're using a standard format, we should be able to read any of the hashes that the Crypt library supports. The method we're calling in the Crypt API uses the default for that library, which is currently SHA-512, but it could change over time. Even if it changes, we will still be able to read the old values. However, the old values won't automatically upgrade like they are now doing for the legacy format we previously used. Users will benefit from the new hash supported by the library only if they change their password. That's typical for how crypt(3) is used with passwd files in Linux, so I think it's a normal expectation. However, as you saw, we do have a unit test to give us a heads up if something changes with the default, so we can address it on a case-by-case basis if it comes up. SHA-3 is being slowly adopted, so I expect we'll have to deal with it at some point, but probably not for quite a while.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/744635177/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/744663523","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1837#issuecomment-744663523","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1837","id":744663523,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0NDY2MzUyMw==","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-14T19:36:04Z","updated_at":"2020-12-14T19:39:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> in such a way that T1C.T1 and SC.T1 are ignored in favor of T2C.T1 \r\n\r\n@hlgp I'm a little confused by your nomenclature, so let me translate first to make sure I understand, then I'll address it:\r\n\r\nImagine a config key: `table.custom.table1.key`\r\n\r\n* In the system configuration, the value is set to `v0`\r\n* In `table1`'s configuration, the value is set to `v1`\r\n* In `table2`'s configuration, the value is set to `v2`\r\n* In `table3`'s configuration, no value is set\r\n\r\nIt sounds like what you're saying is that if `table2` sets `table.custom.table1.key = v2`, then operations performing in the context of `table1` will see the `v2` value instead of `v0` or `v1`. Is that what you are saying?\r\n\r\nIf so, that is definitely not the case. Operations performing in the context of `table1` will see `v1`, operations performing in the context of `table2` will see `v2`, and operations performing in the context of `table3` will see `v0`.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the key contains the name of `table1` has no bearing on whether its value will be seen in any particular context. In general, the only thing that matters is where the configuration is set.\r\n\r\nThe bug with the `HostRegexTableLoadBalancer` was a special case. It is *not* the case that the configuration of one table was affecting the context of another table. Rather, it was because that balancer was explicitly switching to each table's context and incorporating any config it found anywhere. The config wasn't affecting other contexts... the balancer was reading from all contexts. The current behavior fixes that bug, and only reads from the system context. Additionally, it logs warnings if it finds these properties in any per-table context, so that if something was working before and isn't after an upgrade, users will have some clue as to why.\r\n\r\nThis balancer should never have used the `table.custom.` prefix, as these properties were never intended to be stored in per-table configuration. They were intended to be stored in system configuration only... like other properties with the `general.custom.` prefix. I suspect that these predated the addition of `general.custom.` properties, and that's why it worked the way it did. This bug persists in 1.10, but the use of this balancer is a pretty niche use case, and there is a workaround. We could implement a simple fix in 1.10, like @ivakegg suggested, but nobody has done that. It would be a slight behavior change that could unexpectedly break people (while fixing others), so I'm not sure if it's worth it in a bugfix release.\r\n\r\nSo, I hope I understood what you were saying, and that my explanation makes sense. My main point is that I think this was an issue of `HostRegexTableLoadBalancer`, specifically, and not a general problem. Furthermore, it has been fixed in 2.1 development, and there is a workaround in 1.10. If somebody submits a PR to fix it for 1.10, feel free to ping me on it and I'd be happy to review it. I think it might just involve adding a line to `if (!tableName.equals(table.getKey())) { continue; }` after https://github.com/apache/accumulo/blob/56142a89952533fef922fa86739a879c073e7c2a/server/base/src/main/java/org/apache/accumulo/server/master/balancer/HostRegexTableLoadBalancer.java#L244\r\nHowever, I have not experimented or tested with this. It's just a guess from glancing at the code, and would probably need some sort of unit test case to go with it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/744663523/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/744701501","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1837#issuecomment-744701501","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1837","id":744701501,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0NDcwMTUwMQ==","user":{"login":"hlgp","id":31748527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNzQ4NTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31748527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlgp","html_url":"https://github.com/hlgp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlgp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlgp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlgp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlgp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlgp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlgp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlgp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlgp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlgp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-14T20:48:24Z","updated_at":"2020-12-14T20:48:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\"It sounds like what you're saying is that if table2 sets table.custom.table1.key = v2, then operations performing in the context of table1 will see the v2 value instead of v0 or v1.

I was talking about system-level operations, as exhibited by the HostRegexTabletLoadBalancer which you characterize perfectly here.  Everything hereafter in your synopsis I agree with.  We are saying the same things.  The fix is great for this specific issue, but I was thinking bigger picture thereafter.  I keep getting told what the code does and I'm trying to propose what it *could* do.\r\n\r\nWhat I was saying further was that the behavior of the HostRegexTabletLoadBalancer brought into question the need for system-level tablename properties (config.foo.bar.table1) since it does (or did at the time) pull from all contexts and could have surmised, from each table's context, that tables own regex.  Accumulo has a very nice config inheritance structure:  system-level configs inherited or overridden within each table context as necessary.  Having a table-name-specific-system-level property blurs that structure in a way that I thought it was worth exploring a refactor.  If in 2.0+ the system-level operations no longer have access to the table contexts, then perhaps this point is moot.

I understand now.\r\n\r\n> If in 2.0+ the system-level operations no longer have access to the table contexts, then perhaps this point is moot.\r\n\r\nIn 2.0+, these kinds of operations can still access per-table config, if they need it. Even if we didn't provide an API through the pluggable interface, like we do for the balancer right now, they could always use some other tactic (like reflection or accessing static APIs) to get what they want.

It leads to pluggable implementations that ship with Accumulo using `general.custom.*` and `table.custom.*`, and implementations that could be modularized and separated from our main code base using their own dedicated property keys listed in `Property.java` to the point where they are too tightly coupled with other Accumulo code. It prevents a company at, say \"Example, Inc.\" from using the property namespace `com.example.awesomeiterator.feature1=enabled`, and forces too verbose property names for ones we maintain ourselves.\r\n\r\nRather than create a new dedicated namespace for table configuration properties for use in the system namespace, I'd rather relax the restrictions on property names. Then, we could do something like `hostregexbalancer.regex.table1=...` and not be so controlling of how properties are set and managed. We can reserve the `accumulo.*` namespace for ourselves, of course (and the current namespaces, `system.*`, `general.*`, `table.*`, etc. for backwards-compatibility), but otherwise, I don't think we should be too restrictive about properties users set, whether they are in system config or per-table config.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/744710236/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/744713268","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1378#issuecomment-744713268","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1378","id":744713268,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0NDcxMzI2OA==","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-14T21:12:01Z","updated_at":"2020-12-14T21:12:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@DomGarguilo This was obsoleted by #1441 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/744713268/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/744717509","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1837#issuecomment-744717509","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1837","id":744717509,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0NDcxNzUwOQ==","user":{"login":"hlgp","id":31748527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNzQ4NTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31748527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlgp","html_url":"https://github.com/hlgp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlgp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlgp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlgp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlgp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlgp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlgp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlgp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlgp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlgp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-14T21:20:15Z","updated_at":"2020-12-14T21:20:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Oh, yes, I entirely agree with keeping properties flexible, but keeping to certain tenets can also prevent confusion (like what we just experienced with the balancer) and unintended or obscured contradictions in configs.

seems that something like the `.withProtection()` in curator could be implemented to help with this issue. From what I understand, `.withProtection()` prefixes the name of the node being created with a GUID/UUID which, if creation fails, is searched for on the parent path and returned if found. In accumulo if node creation fails, depending on why it fails, the creation is either retried or an exception is thrown. My thinking is that during this retry, before an attempt is made to create a new node, the name of the initial node prefixed with the UUID is searched for and returned if found.
