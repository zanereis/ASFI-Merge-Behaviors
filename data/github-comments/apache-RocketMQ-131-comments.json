I thought there was no such a document...Let's combine their content and enhance its readability.\r\n\r\n@lizhanhui That would be great. In fact, i wish the document was more detailed. such as, the `tlsTestModeEnable` property it's a blur for me. as i know, when many cloud vendors  use the ssl feature, the just need customers use one line code.\r\n> producer.setUseTLS(true)\r\n\r\ni was wondering think that whether they have abused this property. Usually, we should configure `tls.client.trustCertPath` first isn't it?  so, i'm a bit confused about it name(test mode...).\r\nHope you help me understand it. 🙏\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1277437317/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1278307874","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/1609#issuecomment-1278307874","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/1609","id":1278307874,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl85MMW4i","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-14T00:13:57Z","updated_at":"2022-10-14T00:13:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue was closed because it has been inactive for 3 days since being marked as stale.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1278307874/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1278362374","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/5308#issuecomment-1278362374","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/5308","id":1278362374,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl85MMkMG","user":{"login":"echooymxq","id":19860963,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5ODYwOTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19860963?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/echooymxq","html_url":"https://github.com/echooymxq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echooymxq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echooymxq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echooymxq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echooymxq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echooymxq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echooymxq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echooymxq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echooymxq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echooymxq/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-14T01:38:16Z","updated_at":"2022-10-14T01:38:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"RocketMQ base on java8, you did a great job.

The scenario used by this configuration is that when the message is written, the system has a thread that can do some other logic to the message. For example: build indexes, consume queues, notify long pull client requests. The thread will maintain a message index, and compare this index with the``` maximum offset``` of the ```current maximum written message``` to get whether there is a message that needs to be processed.\r\n\r\nWhen the system restarts, it will be based on duplicationEnable to decide whether to process the message from the beginning or only process the new message. When duplicationEnable is true, you also need to set ```CommitLog.confirmOffset``` to process the message from the beginning, because by default, ```CommitLog.confirmOffset``` and ```ReputMessageService.reputFromOffset``` are equal after the system is started. For details, see the code ```ReputMessageService.doReput.```\r\n\r\nThe  ```ReputMessageService``` is responsible for the execution of the logic for dispatching messages.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1279884285/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1279891645","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/5307#issuecomment-1279891645","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/5307","id":1279891645,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl85MSZi9","user":{"login":"nowinkeyy","id":72536832,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTM2ODMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72536832?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nowinkeyy","html_url":"https://github.com/nowinkeyy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nowinkeyy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nowinkeyy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nowinkeyy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nowinkeyy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nowinkeyy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nowinkeyy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nowinkeyy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nowinkeyy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nowinkeyy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-16T04:51:33Z","updated_at":"2022-10-16T04:51:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @complone , thank you for your reply.\r\nI know what you mean.

So your improvement is just to execute the dispatcher asynchronously? It seems that the batch write you describe will not work in most cases.\r\n\r\nThe core of this optimization is to process dispatchRequest concurrently, so that different cq can be written at the same time, and even the same cq can be written at limited time (this needs more thought). The proposal has been updated. Now I use batch update commit-position instead of batch write messages. \r\n\r\n> I don't see anything about recovering from fault in your proposal. eg. Where to start rebuilding cq after broker is down and restart.\r\n\r\nIt is true that I have given less consideration to this aspect, and I prefer to follow the original thinking.\r\n\r\n**the updated
