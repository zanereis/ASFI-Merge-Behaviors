I looked up the failure on Jenkins ([here](https://builds.apache.org/job/kafka-trunk-git-pr-jdk7/3085/testReport/junit/kafka.security.auth/SimpleAclAuthorizerTest/testHighConcurrencyModificationOfResourceAcls/)) and the failure is due to too many retries.

for the PR. I think we need to document in the code the reasoning for the proposed strategy where most fields are protected by synchronization but a couple are not.\n\nIt would also be interesting to know if the consumer also suffers from similar bottlenecks and, if so, whether these change fix that case too.\n\nWhat are your thoughts @guozhangwang @ewencp? For reference, I quote from the JIRA the relevant figures:\n\n\"Due to sync on the single producer, MM in a setup with 32 consumer threads could not send more than \n358k msg/sec hence not being able to saturate the NIC.\"\n\n\"After applying the patch, MM could copy the entire data (447k msg/sec) with no lagging. The bytes-in rate was 183m per sec. We have not tried it yet with an input rate large enough to saturate a 10G NIC and we might discover other bottlenecks when doing so.\"\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/202768155/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/202768431","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1111#issuecomment-202768431","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1111","id":202768431,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwMjc2ODQzMQ==","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-29T08:01:44Z","updated_at":"2016-03-29T08:01:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Also,
