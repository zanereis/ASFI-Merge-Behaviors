think a good solution to this problem would be to make the level in the tree to which updates are pushed up configurable.   Stopping before level 0 would create multiple trees in the table, instead of a single tree.   To obtain the # of unique ints, would just need to scan all of the trees root nodes (once all notifications a processed).  The nice thing about making this configurable is that you can still get the crazy number of collisions if you want that for testing purposes.\n\nIn order to scan the root nodes at a particular level, the structure of the row would need to be changed.  I think changing it from \n\n```\n<hash>:<level>:<nodes size>:<number> \n```\n\nto\n\n```\n<level>:<hash>:<nodes size>:<number> \n```\n\nWould allow one to easily scan level `05` and still avoid the problem for which the hash was added in #312. \n\nAlso the Print command needs to be changed anyway.  It currently attempts to scan the entire tree, however after #343 this is not always feasible. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/63930544/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/64225523","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fluo/issues/320#issuecomment-64225523","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/320","id":64225523,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MjI1NTIz","user":{"login":"mikewalch","id":730698,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMDY5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/730698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch","html_url":"https://github.com/mikewalch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-24T16:59:16Z","updated_at":"2014-11-24T16:59:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Saw this NPE again while running `fluo scan`\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/64225523/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/64237007","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fluo/pull/350#issuecomment-64237007","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/350","id":64237007,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MjM3MDA3","user":{"login":"mikewalch","id":730698,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMDY5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/730698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch","html_url":"https://github.com/mikewalch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-24T18:11:39Z","updated_at":"2014-11-24T18:11:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"It looks like the TrieBasicIT & TrieMapRedIT are now taking a long time (~5 min & 1.5 min) with this commit.

I think I saw a peak rate of ~100K transactions per minute, but it was a week ago and my memory is a bit fuzzy.  Also it completed processing all notifications much more quickly because there were not many collisions.  I ran these test on m1.large instances.  They are cheap, but not that fast.  I wish I had kept some of the graphite plots.\n\nAfter surpassing the collision problem I ran into another issue.   Tablets for levels within the tree were not balanced evenly across the cluster.  In one test run I had multiple tablets containing the root nodes, however many of these tablets ended up on one tserver.  I saw performance drop when lots of threads started trying to update the root nodes.   I killed the tserver w/ all the root nodes (forcing them to spread out across the tservers) and saw performance increase in subsequent
