What I would suggest is backing out the last patch db9ac77f1e9c01ae57a9c6df48cb8670e9045ebb which changed the python stuff.  I have cherry picked that into THRIFT-4084 which I am working on so you can drop it.  I will send you another PR shortly which eliminates this non-c_glib stuff from your effort and passes both \"make check\" and \"make cross\" locally.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/279402245/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/279457840","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/1185#issuecomment-279457840","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/1185","id":279457840,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3OTQ1Nzg0MA==","user":{"login":"gadLinux","id":233204,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMzIwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/233204?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gadLinux","html_url":"https://github.com/gadLinux","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gadLinux/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gadLinux/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gadLinux/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gadLinux/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gadLinux/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gadLinux/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gadLinux/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gadLinux/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gadLinux/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-13T17:15:58Z","updated_at":"2017-02-13T17:15:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I cross my fingers so it passes the tests.

with folks who created crosstest what we should do.  My preference is to have a single \"multiplexed\" protocol test that uses the binary protocol.  That will be the most widely used combo, and layering multiplexed on top of any other protocol does not test any new functionality of multiplexed; but it might catch strange interactions that we could miss if we don't test all of them.  I'm not fond of the explosion of the test matrix, doubling all the tests potentially.  \r\n\r\nIf you look in tests.json you will see protocols like \"binary\" and then \"binary:accel\", also \"compact\" and \"compact:accelc\".  This naming format basically says that if crosstest is testing \"binary\" it will match \"binary\" and \"binary:accel\", however the test wll be run once with a --protocol of \"binary\" and once with a --protocol of \"accel\".  I didn't want to add \"binary:multi\", \"compact:multic\", \"json:multij\", \"header:multih\" but that would be the logical extension of the pattern that already exists in crosstest.\r\n\r\nSo I'm working on a copy of your branch right now to simplify down to \"multiplexed\" and then I want to see it run in the crosstest locally.  Then once I hear back from some folks we can move forward if they are okay with the simplification.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/281093178/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/281128319","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/1191#issuecomment-281128319","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/1191","id":281128319,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MTEyODMxOQ==","user":{"login":"jeking3","id":11771245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzcxMjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11771245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3","html_url":"https://github.com/jeking3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-20T16:46:47Z","updated_at":"2017-02-20T16:46:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Well I was hoping the multiplexed implementation was compatible with older clients using binary protocol but it is not.

Also it is possible to create and run unit and integration tests with .Net Core now. \r\n\r\nSo, I want to start work on unit tests (maybe also on integration tests) and upgrade library to current stable version of  .Net Core.\r\n\r\nThe only question for me - how do you build libraries on build server and also how I can find some basic help about how to do that. It will be good to know to avoid issues with changes. \r\n\r\nAlso it will be great to understand how do you include some new frameworks into Thrift.exe generator to easy include generation of .Net Core generator into official Thrift.exe generator - some people asked me recently how to build it because .Net Core generator still not included into Thrift.exe. \r\n\r\nP.S. As always I will create task in Apache Jira for new pull request )\r\n\r\nThanks \r\nVolodymyr","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/287589424/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
