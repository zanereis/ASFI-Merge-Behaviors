It could be the indexing of partitions or the partitioner. The first time I found that `mapPartitions` has a parameter called `perservesPartitioning`, I thought this is to preserve the indexing of partitions --- so partition 0 maps to partition 0 and partition 1 maps to partition 1, etc.\n\nThis causes problems. For example, we set `preservesPartitioning` to `true` in `RDD.zip` and the following code won't run correctly:\n\n```\nval a = sc.makeRDD(Seq(0, 1, 2, 3, 4)).map(x => (x, 1)).partitionBy(new HashPartitioner(2))\nval b = a.map(x => 1)\na.zip(b).join(a.map(x => (x, 1)).collect()\n```\n\nBtw, `preservePartitioning` is used in streaming instead of `preservesPartitioning`. @tdas\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49822452/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49823327","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1501#issuecomment-49823327","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1501","id":49823327,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5ODIzMzI3","user":{"login":"tgravescs","id":4563792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjM3OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4563792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs","html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-23T01:35:55Z","updated_at":"2014-07-23T01:35:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1, thanks!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49823327/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49823561","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1448#issuecomment-49823561","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1448","id":49823561,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5ODIzNTYx","user":{"login":"chenghao-intel","id":2367031,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjcwMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2367031?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel","html_url":"https://github.com/chenghao-intel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-23T01:39:49Z","updated_at":"2014-07-23T01:39:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Generally the code looks good to me, except some of the potential performance issues.
