What is each data point? Is it individual data point or aggregated? Could you give a more concrete example? \r\n\r\nWhat does `geohash.decode` and `geohash.bbox` do? What is the `code` argument?\r\n\r\nRegarding `viz.py` and embeddable components. Most of the visualization `js` code will be move out of this repo as individual `npm` package plugin. I haven't moved the `deck.gl` directory but could do so after the first round or altogether. Ideally, they should be moved too. This may increase the overhead in development a bit but make them embeddable and keep the main repo lean. \r\n\r\nThe backend logic for legacy charts can still live in `viz.py` and be updated in the meantime but no new chart should add logic to `viz.py` and we should gradually reduce the code from this file.
