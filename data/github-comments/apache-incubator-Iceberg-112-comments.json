This is what I've done. I resized my cluster to a single task node, started `bpftrace` and then submitted the Spark application.  Some of the jobs executed just fine and I didn't get any output, so I think there might have been an issue in my tracing setup itself. What's strange it that `touch s3fileio-something` resulted in an output in `bpftrace`, so the setup was not completely broken either.\r\n\r\n@alex-shchetkov if I understand your comment correctly, before you had the `tmp/driver` directory created on every node your jobs consistently failed, is that correct? In my case most of the jobs succeed, it's just some of them that failed with the `No such file or directory` exception.\r\n\r\n In general, is it correct that Iceberg **always** creates a temporary file with prefix `s3fileio`?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/920679781/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/920680998","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/3055#issuecomment-920680998","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3055","id":920680998,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX8424Hom","user":{"login":"fcvr1010","id":17031474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDMxNDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17031474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fcvr1010","html_url":"https://github.com/fcvr1010","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fcvr1010/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fcvr1010/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fcvr1010/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fcvr1010/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fcvr1010/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fcvr1010/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fcvr1010/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fcvr1010/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fcvr1010/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-16T08:04:22Z","updated_at":"2021-09-16T08:04:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@rdblue thanks for your comment.

Add watermark transfer support for various operations, like delete, rewrite and so on: But this idea have a problem, In the scenario of streaming write while file rewrite, It is common for new data to be written in the process of rewrite start to end. that is to say, when snapshot s1 has watermark w1 when file rewrite begin, then streaming write commit new snapshot s2 has watermark w2, then file rewrite complete for snapshot s3 with watermark w3, to calculate w3, in addition to passing w1 to w3, we must also perform additional calculations on w2. It looks very complicated and hard to understand.\r\n2. Keep the current implementation in this pr, only record watermark in append operation: When we need to get the watermark of the current table, we will backtrack the table snapshot until we get the watermark value in the most recent append operation.\r\n\r\nI prefer solution 2. what about you think?

Some ways I thought about going around this issue?\r\n\r\n- From Gradle, after relocating `org.apache.orc` to `org.apache.iceberg.shaded.org.apache.orc.OrcTail`, modify the class `HiveVectorizedReader` to let it point back to `org.apache.orc.OrcTail` instead of `org.apache.iceberg.shaded.org.apache.orc.OrcTail`.\r\n- Copy the `OrcSplit` class from Hive source code and in gradle, relocate it to the shaded folder in order to avoid any conflicts with Hive libraries. This should work but I am not convinced to copy things as it may give maintenance overhead.  \r\n- Shade the whole `org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.orc` under `org.apache.iceberg.shaded.org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.orc`.\r\n\r\nAny other ideas @szlta as as I can see you were the original author of this PR: https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2613 ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/921917532/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/921950503","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/3041#issuecomment-921950503","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3041","id":921950503,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX84289kn","user":{"login":"tprelle","id":59021490,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MDIxNDkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59021490?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tprelle","html_url":"https://github.com/tprelle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tprelle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tprelle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tprelle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tprelle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tprelle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tprelle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tprelle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tprelle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tprelle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-17T17:07:46Z","updated_at":"2021-09-17T17:07:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @omarsmak \r\nI try to shade the entire org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.orc i do not achieve do it because hive-exec the native jar it's a uber jar so it's hard.\r\nI achieve to make it work before my vacation with the copy of OrcSplit as hive iceberg it's currently or already moved into hive 4 it's just temporary so it can be ok.\r\nI can send the PR with this change if it's the good solution for you.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/921950503/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/921955290","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/3041#issuecomment-921955290","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3041","id":921955290,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX8428-va","user":{"login":"omarsmak","id":1190920,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTA5MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1190920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/omarsmak","html_url":"https://github.com/omarsmak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omarsmak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omarsmak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omarsmak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omarsmak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omarsmak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omarsmak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omarsmak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omarsmak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omarsmak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-17T17:15:38Z","updated_at":"2021-09-17T17:15:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hey @tprelle, I am not a committer for this project and thus me myself is seeking for solution for this as well :).

[Actually, Flink 1.13 will continue to use `TableFactory` API](https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/5f007ff6c8224c6e5a14de2c79296eb85a22fe1f/flink-table/flink-table-common/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/table/factories/FactoryUtil.java#L240). So only implementing `TableFactory` is the method with the least changes and the lowest risk to upgrade to 1.13. Which way do you prefer? Implementing both or just `TableFactory`?\r\n\r\nOh that's rather unfortunate. I had hoped that Flink 1.13 would use the new interface, if present, while allowing for the old interface to also be implemented for backwards compatibility.\r\n\r\nPerhaps somebody more involved with the Flink Community than myself can comment as to whether or not there might be a flag added or that could be added to tell Flink to prefer the new interface first (when present).\r\n\r\nI would suggest implementing both interfaces for now (and also organizing the interface functions so that they're organized together based on which interface), so as to keep support for Flink 1.12.\r\n\r\nWhile this won't give us the benefit of the new API, we can upgrade to Flink 1.13.2 and then consider the importance of that later on. I would still implement the new API functions though (since it's already been done), and then we can track that in a follow up issue. We might indeed decide dropping support for 1.12 is worth it, but we can't make that decision on our own.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Perhaps it can be broken up into two different classes, and then when we build the jar only one META-INF file is placed on the class path depending on the Flink version. Seems really messy, but possibly we can consider this down the road.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts on this @stevenzwu @openinx?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/922070927/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/922072886","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3094#issuecomment-922072886","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3094","id":922072886,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX8429bc2","user":{"login":"flyrain","id":1322359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjIzNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1322359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyrain","html_url":"https://github.com/flyrain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyrain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyrain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyrain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyrain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyrain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyrain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyrain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyrain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyrain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-17T20:48:44Z","updated_at":"2021-09-17T20:48:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks all for the review.

The setup phase time is included with the iteration time so if the time limit is set to 10 minutes, and setup takes 27 minutes you will never start.\r\n\r\nI turned on the UI and saw we start this test by writing 10 files during the setup phase. On my excellent MBP (2020) it takes almost 3 minutes to write each file. The test itself completes nearly immediately following the final file being written taking almost no time at all for any of the read iterations.\r\n\r\nHere are the results when I modified the test to allow 30 minutes per iteration. Again this is almost completely devoted to the \"setup\" and \"appendFile\" phase.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Warmup: 3 iterations, single-shot each\r\n# Measurement: 5 iterations, single-shot each\r\n# Timeout: 30 min per iteration\r\n# Threads: 1 thread\r\n# Benchmark mode: Single shot invocation time\r\n# Benchmark: org.apache.iceberg.spark.source.parquet.vectorized.VectorizedReadDictionaryEncodedFlatParquetDataBenchmark.readDatesIcebergVectorized5k\r\n\r\n# Run progress: 0.00% complete, ETA 00:00:00\r\n# Fork: 1 of 1\r\n# Warmup Iteration   1: 3.800 s/op\r\n# Warmup Iteration   2: 3.178 s/op\r\n# Warmup Iteration   3: 3.038 s/op\r\nIteration   1: 3.122 s/op\r\nIteration   2: ok 3.014 s/op\r\nIteration   3: 3.057 s/op\r\nIteration   4: 3.182 s/op\r\nIteration   5: 2.979 s/op\r\n\r\n\r\nResult \"org.apache.iceberg.spark.source.parquet.vectorized.VectorizedReadDictionaryEncodedFlatParquetDataBenchmark.readDatesIcebergVectorized5k\":\r\n  N = 5\r\n  mean =      3.071 ±(99.9%) 0.314 s/op\r\n\r\n  Histogram, s/op:\r\n    [2.900, 2.925) = 0\r\n    [2.925, 2.950) = 0\r\n    [2.950, 2.975) = 0\r\n    [2.975, 3.000) = 1\r\n    [3.000, 3.025) = 1\r\n    [3.025, 3.050) = 0\r\n    [3.050, 3.075) = 1\r\n    [3.075, 3.100) = 0\r\n    [3.100, 3.125) = 1\r\n    [3.125, 3.150) = 0\r\n    [3.150, 3.175) = 0\r\n\r\n  Percentiles, s/op:\r\n      p(0.0000) =      2.979 s/op\r\n     p(50.0000) =      3.057 s/op\r\n     p(90.0000) =      3.182 s/op\r\n     p(95.0000) =      3.182 s/op\r\n     p(99.0000) =      3.182 s/op\r\n     p(99.9000) =      3.182 s/op\r\n     p(99.9900) =      3.182 s/op\r\n     p(99.9990) =      3.182 s/op\r\n     p(99.9999) =      3.182 s/op\r\n    p(100.0000) =      3.182 s/op\r\n    ```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/923046069/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/923049772","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3049#issuecomment-923049772","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3049","id":923049772,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX843BJ8s","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-20T15:46:39Z","updated_at":"2021-09-20T15:46:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jackye1995, could you also propose an update to the spec for tracking key metadata like this?
