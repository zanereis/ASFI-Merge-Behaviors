So we could have a test where we call `rebalanceListener.onPartitionsAssigned(assignedPartitions);` - we overload `StreamThread.createStreamTask` to create a task with a simple topology that just has a single state store, and we overload the `commitOffsets` method of the Task to throw the `CommitFailedException`. Keep a reference to the `StateStore` for validation\r\nThen we invoke `rebalanceListener.onPartitionsRevoked(...)` which will cause the task to throw the exception. We then need to check that we get the `CommitFailedException` and we should also check that the store is actually closed, i.e., by calling `stateStore.isOpen(..)` and checking that it returns false or by calling `stateStore.get(\"key\")` and checking that it throws an `InvalidStateStoreException` ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/264123297/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/264124254","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2193#issuecomment-264124254","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2193","id":264124254,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NDEyNDI1NA==","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-01T09:33:15Z","updated_at":"2016-12-01T09:33:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Great news @enothereska, thanks for testing.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/264124254/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/264125293","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2193#issuecomment-264125293","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2193","id":264125293,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NDEyNTI5Mw==","user":{"login":"enothereska","id":14234336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjM0MzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14234336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska","html_url":"https://github.com/enothereska","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-01T09:38:02Z","updated_at":"2016-12-01T09:38:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Actually folks, it turns out I was testing with max.poll.records = 1000 by mistake.

@mdemierre Sorry for the late reply. We have several timestamp management improvements that were under discussions recently and `punctuate()` semantics is one of them, and that is partially why it took so long as we want to see the whole design before making any concrete decisions on each of these areas.\r\n\r\nThe current plan is to change the semantics of `punctuate()` to be purely \"time driven\", instead of \"part time driven, and part data-driven\". That is, the punctuate function triggering will no longer be dependent whether there are new data arriving, and hence not on the timestamps of the arrival data either (note that the stream time will only be updated when there are new data coming, so if there is not then the stream time will never advance, hence not triggering `punctuate` at all under the current semantics). Instead it will be triggered only by system wall-clock time. \r\n\r\nAs for users, the programming pattern would be:\r\n\r\n1. If you need to add a pure time-driven computation logic, use `punctuate()`.\r\n2. If you need to add a data-driven computation logic, you should always use `process()`, and in `process()` users can choose to trigger some specific logic only every some time units, but still when a new data has arrived and hence being processed.\r\n\r\nWe are about to propose a KIP for this change as it modifies the public APIs and I hope to have it in the next minor release, targeted 2017
