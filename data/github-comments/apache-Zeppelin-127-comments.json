Problem is that I and my colleagues are backend developers whom want develop interpreters and integrate zeppelin  (to Hadoop e.g. and other cluster technologies) and the do not know anything about UI development (in common). They use usually vms for testing and development. And they use maven as the most mature build tool. I and my collegues don't want learn nodejs and how to solve it's bugs. I have more than 15 years experience as developer. Last time I have developed UI 7 years ago. Only this gave me possibility find solution fast. To be honest my experience with nodejs was not so sweet.\r\nLet's give to all developers possibility contribute to zeppelin!
