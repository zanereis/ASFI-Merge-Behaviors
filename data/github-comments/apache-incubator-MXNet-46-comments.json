And it makes no sense to me that the base `Initializer` class would process 'bias', 'gamma', 'weights' etc one by one. It's a ridiculous design.\n\nAn initializer should be responsible for initializing **one and any one variable**. And it's users responsibility to determine which variable this initializer will init. \n\nWith the current design, the `Uniform` initializer should be called `UniformWeight` because it can't be used on bias or any other variables. And users will have to write another 'UniformBias' initializer if they need, which has almost duplicated code.\n\nApart from code reusability, maintainer will have to add a new line in `Initializer` whenever there is a new variable defined in some new layer, to provide a default initialization behavior.\n\nTensorflow, for example, does a better job where you can specify how to initialize the variable at variable definition time. In this way default initialization can then be built into layers.\n\nBTW @Gelu74 there is a bug in `mx.init.Mixed` which affects python3. If you use python3, you might want to wait for #1361 to be merged.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/175296036/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/175320275","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/1360#issuecomment-175320275","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1360","id":175320275,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3NTMyMDI3NQ==","user":{"login":"attitudechunfeng","id":6939658,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5Mzk2NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6939658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/attitudechunfeng","html_url":"https://github.com/attitudechunfeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attitudechunfeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attitudechunfeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attitudechunfeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attitudechunfeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attitudechunfeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attitudechunfeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attitudechunfeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attitudechunfeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attitudechunfeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-27T01:01:27Z","updated_at":"2016-01-27T01:01:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks a lot@jmschrei.

I'm assuming there is a layer-like abstraction such as the `ConvFactory` in imagenet examples. And if initialization method of a variable can be given in variable definition time (like in TensorFlow), a layer abstraction will then be able to provide default initialization. But I guess this will introduce too many changes to the current system.\nSorry that I might be unclear about the opinion. I think there are two issues with the current design that are worth a discussion:\n- The initializers in the code right now are parameter-specific: `Uniform` is actually `UniformWeight` initializer. The alternative is to have an initializer available to use with any parameters, and let users choose explicitly, for example, like:\n\n``` python\nmx.init.Mixed(['.*_weight', '.*'], [mx.init.Uniform(),SomeDefaultInitializer()])\n```\n\nThe advantage is to have reusable code for the implementation of initializer, especially when parameters with new names are created.\n- The author of a layer abstraction (such as `ConvFactory`) cannot suggest its users a default initializer. Therefore if a new layer abstraction, or simply some new parameters in the graph with un-recognized names are created, either the source code of `Initializer` base class has to be modified to recognize the name and perform default initializer, or a user must explicitly give this default initilaizer through mx.init.Mixed before he starts training. \n  I think neither of \"maintaining a list of names in the source code\" or  \"having users to write code to get default behavior\", is a good idea.\n\nThanks\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/175354482/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/175354825","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/1360#issuecomment-175354825","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1360","id":175354825,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3NTM1NDgyNQ==","user":{"login":"jmschrei","id":3916816,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MTY4MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3916816?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmschrei","html_url":"https://github.com/jmschrei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmschrei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmschrei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmschrei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmschrei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmschrei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmschrei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmschrei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmschrei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmschrei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-27T02:39:19Z","updated_at":"2016-01-27T02:39:19Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"If you're using python, add `eval_metric='rmse'` to the fit method.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/175354825/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/175363513","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/1356#issuecomment-175363513","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1356","id":175363513,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3NTM2MzUxMw==","user":{"login":"piiswrong","id":568948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODk0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong","html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-27T03:13:36Z","updated_at":"2016-01-27T03:22:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I don't like the current name based approach either but it hasn't caused enough trouble to compel action.

Was traveling and trying to build a basic prototype of sequence APIing during the last week. We will discuss to finalize that this weekend. I guess we can discuss about the details during the meeting. But here are some thoughts related to your comments above.\n\nI think your concern that explicitly unrolled models have this issue of having to deal with sequences that are shorter than the unrolled length, especially in attention models and bidirectional models. But I do not understand how the Tensorflow way could resolve this. Based on my understanding of your description above, they explicitly unroll for several possible lengths (5, 10, 15, 25, etc.). But unless they do this for every possible sequence length, there is still cases where the actual sequence length does not match the unrolled length. Right? Are you talking about [this officien seq2seq example in tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/0.6.0/tutorials/seq2seq/index.html)? I will try to have a look at that before our discussion.\n\nThe prototype we come up is a hybrid imperative + symbolic solution with minimum modification to the existing MXNet internals. Basically it uses the Python side to explicitly schedule recurrence and the computation graph is instantiated only for one time step.\n- We will support automatic unrolling, so if memory is enough, unrolling the symbolic graph for a few time steps would speed up the computation.\n- While many of the existing RNN toolkits do recurrent scheduling at a _layer_ or _operator_ level, we do scheduling globally for the whole computation graph. We believe this is more efficient and in some way easier to crack within the current architecture of MXNet internals. This means\n  - The whole network has to have the same recurrence sequence pattern (e.g. forward sweeping through the input sequence, backward sweeping, etc.). This is of course not true for the translation model you described above, because you have a bi-directional recurrence, which collapse into a single output, and then a forward RNN with attention to the original sequence. But this issue could resolved if we allow flexible composition or combination of RNN networks with different scheduling patterns. The actual API for composing networks is still open.\n  - The layers with recurrence pattern does not need to be an _atomic_ operator (like `FullyConnected` or `Convolution`). It could be a sub computation graph that combines existing operators. As a result, it becomes very flexible to construct recurrent \"operators\" purely in Python by composing a subgraph using symbolic API. So for example, an LSTM cell, or the attention module -- a softmax that summarize the last 3 inputs for example -- could easily be defined in Python. \n\nI'll send the actual meeting time by tonight. We can discuss more details during the meeting.
