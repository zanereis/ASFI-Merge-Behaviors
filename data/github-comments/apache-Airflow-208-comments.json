Responses below:\r\n\r\n 1. Airflow templating cannot always be used. For example, we have an operator that generates file-names based on data it pulls from BigQuery. It takes a Jinja-template for the file-name as parameter, and then renders that template many times during execution. There might also be cases of fields that look like Jinja templates, but really aren't.\r\n\r\n2. In Python, objects can implement [hooks for attribute access][1] which can for example dynamically generate attributes, or delegate the attribute lookup somewhere else entirely. This is useful when implementing dynamic proxies for example. To be fair though, I can't come up with a realistic use-case for that in this context, so it might not be relevant here.\r\n\r\n3. I'd probably prefer `template_fields` just for the consistency with operators. I believe it is acceptable to require modifications for classes that want to leverage this, as the way this mechanism works is very specific to begin with. Template attributes are rendered after object initialization, so this only works for attributes that are stored unmodified, and not used in any other way inside `__init__`.  Overall I feel like the potential for subtle bugs with an implicit mechanism is quite high, and as we know from `import this`: _Explicit is better than implicit._ ;)\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any more questions, and thanks for putting in the work here!\r\n\r\n[1]: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html?highlight=object%20model#customizing-attribute-access","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/472317330/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/472325428","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4909#issuecomment-472325428","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4909","id":472325428,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MjMyNTQyOA==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-13T08:27:03Z","updated_at":"2019-03-13T08:27:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/4909?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#4909](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/4909?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/commit/17eb94f723502d8bbc716763a7513db0a8afa52d?src=pr&el=desc) will **increase** coverage by `0.01%`.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/4909/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=WdLKlKHOAU&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/4909?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@            Coverage Diff             @@\n##           master    #4909      +/-   ##\n==========================================\n+ Coverage   75.54%   75.56%   +0.01%     \n==========================================\n  Files         451      451              \n  Lines       29099    29099              \n==========================================\n+ Hits        21983    21988       +5     \n+ Misses       7116     7111       -5\n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/4909?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [airflow/models/\\_\\_init\\_\\_.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/4909/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9tb2RlbHMvX19pbml0X18ucHk=) | `92.87% <0%> (-0.06%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [airflow/configuration.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/4909/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9jb25maWd1cmF0aW9uLnB5) | `94.4% <0%> (+0.34%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [airflow/contrib/operators/ssh\\_operator.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/4909/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9jb250cmliL29wZXJhdG9ycy9zc2hfb3BlcmF0b3IucHk=) | `83.54% <0%> (+1.26%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [airflow/contrib/kubernetes/kube\\_client.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/4909/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9jb250cmliL2t1YmVybmV0ZXMva3ViZV9jbGllbnQucHk=) | `75% <0%> (+16.66%)` | :arrow_up: |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/4909?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/4909?src=pr&el=footer).

However, as I said in the ticket, we use a non-root user (called `airflow`) to run airflow worker and did not provide `run_as_user` to any task. So the temp file is actually owned by `airflow` user, there is no way it will enter the if condition that you provided in our situation.

The implementation seems fine to me, and the tests seem to cover all the cases. I've left one comment, but I'm not sure if it really needs to be addressed.\r\n\r\nYour example of a `MyAwesomeDataFileTransformer` is actually quite nice to illustrate some of the problems here. For example, what if the `__init__`-method looks like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass MyAwesomeDataFileTransformer:\r\n    def __init__(self, source, target):\r\n        self.source = Path(source)\r\n        self.target = Path(target)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, because the paths are wrapped internally in a `pathlib.Path` instance, you cannot render them anymore (maybe the constructor even raises an exception because these strings aren't valid paths). This doesn't work with any approach. This is why I think that in many cases, classes will have to be customized to work with templating in the first place.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/472735428/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/472743370","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4141#issuecomment-472743370","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4141","id":472743370,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3Mjc0MzM3MA==","user":{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-14T08:02:17Z","updated_at":"2019-03-14T08:02:17Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi @jie8357IOII as shared earlier, most (if not all) K8S-related scripts in this codebase are for CI purpose only.

The problem is that you'll need to duplicate all of the arguments of that transformation on the operator, which needs to propagate them. One way to do this is to have a dictionary for those arguments:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntransform = GCSFileTransformOperator(\r\n    source=\"some/path/{{ds}}/file.xls\",\r\n    target=\"other/path/{{ds}}/file.csv\",\r\n    transform=ExcelToCSV,\r\n    transform_args={\"quote\": True, separator: \",\"}\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works, but what if the operator has multiple such components as inputs? Consider the common file-system interfaces proposed in [AIP-14][1]. With those, we can make the operator more generic:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntransform = FileTransformOperator(\r\n    source=GCSFileSource,\r\n    source_args={\"path\": \"some/path/{{ds}}/file.xls\", \"bucket\": \"some_gcs_bucket\", \"conn_id\": \"gcs_conn\"),\r\n    target=SFTPFileTarget,\r\n    target_args={\"path\": \"other/path/{{ds}}/file.csv\", \"conn_id\": \"sft_conn\", \"retries\": 3},\r\n    transform=ExcelToCSV,\r\n    transform_args={\"quote\": True, \"separator\": \",\"}\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis starts becoming impractical, it would be much simpler to just write:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntransform = FileTransformOperator(\r\n    source=GCSFileSource(path=\"some/path/{{ds}}/file.xls\", bucket=\"some_gcs_bucket\", conn_id=\"gcs_conn\"),\r\n    target=SFTPFileTarget(path=\"other/path/{{ds}}/file.csv\", conn_id=\"sft_conn\", retries=3),\r\n    transform=ExcelToCSV(quote=True, separator=\",\")\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is essentially my use-case in a nutshell. Regarding your concern that this might lead to confusion - that's why I argued for an approach that requires explicit declaration of template fields in all objects/classes that support templates, because that leads to the least surprises (it's explicit, and it follows the current convention for operators). This can easily be added to existing classes, either by monkey-patching or sub-classes, so it's also quite flexible.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/AIP-14+Create+composable+operators+using+common+interfaces","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/473192025/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/473251702","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4685#issuecomment-473251702","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4685","id":473251702,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MzI1MTcwMg==","user":{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-15T11:28:46Z","updated_at":"2019-03-15T11:28:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Nice work @jmcarp -

We do not need it because we can store everything in the DOM tree that we have to build anyway. My code makes testing easier because we only have one global variable (`window`) instead of a few.
