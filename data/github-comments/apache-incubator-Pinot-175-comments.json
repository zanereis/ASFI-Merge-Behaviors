We can discuss this some more if required.\r\n> \r\n> Basically made changes to:\r\n> \r\n> 1. Clear the `_priorityQueue` when an error block is received / returned.\r\n> 2. Always return a no-op when a block is received and the contents are added to the `_priorityQueue`. Earlier I was waiting for all the mailboxes to get processed in the loop before returning a no-op, now I return a no-op immediately for each mailbox.\r\n\r\nYeah when I thought about it more last night I think we shouldn't return a no-op block to every mailbox received.\r\nThe problem I have was to achieve 2 goals:\r\n1. collaborative multi-threading. when some mailboxes (or all mailboxes) are empty, they should give up the thread-worker, so another query stage can run. \r\n    - This is achieved via the return of the no-op block. \r\n    - Some operator doesn't follow this. for example, AggregateOperator will hold onto the thread-worker until all inbound blocks are consumed and created an indexed map.\r\n    - this can be problematic as when multiple stages are running on the same server, it could deadlock awaiting inbound messages; but the inbound stage cannot be scheduled due to thread starvation. (this will not occur as long as mailbox guarantee to return no-op block collaboratively)\r\n\r\n2. fairness when grabbing from all mailboxes. \r\n    - this is more related to the K-loser algorithm we will implement when the sender side is sorting. this way we will maintain some sort of state internally in the sender/receive operator.\r\n    - however, we will actually return some blocks as long as those blocks contain data smaller (or larger when ORDER DESC) than any top row from all mailbox blocks.\r\n\r\nfor now the implementation looks good. i will create an issue to systematically address both points above","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1470319915/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1470443240","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/10427#issuecomment-1470443240","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/10427","id":1470443240,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5XpS7o","user":{"login":"andimiller","id":4661434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NjE0MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4661434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andimiller","html_url":"https://github.com/andimiller","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andimiller/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andimiller/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andimiller/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andimiller/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andimiller/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andimiller/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andimiller/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andimiller/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andimiller/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-15T17:20:47Z","updated_at":"2023-03-15T17:20:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I

A new API work. Does it make sense to still merge this as is in the meantime? It's still a fairly new metric.\r\n\r\nI recommend waiting on the API based change as setting ingestion delay to 0 when all records are filtered is not correct. The delay should still consider the timestamp on the filtered records. \r\nIf the fix was not performant, I wouldn't mind merging and fixing forward. But this pertains to correctness of the solution.
