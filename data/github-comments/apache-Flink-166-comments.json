I focused on adding support for retraction to the new UDAGG interface (PR #3470), support for time mode functions (PR #3370, #3425), and the most simple OVER window case (PR #3397) first. These additions should serve as a good basis for the more advanced OVER window cases. \r\n\r\nI had a look this PR and noticed a few things:\r\n- The Table API is implemented in Scala. We have a few Java classes (code copied & fixed from Calcite, Java examples, and tests) but do not intend to add more. The core parts like operators, translation, and runtime code have to be implemented in Scala. Mixing languages makes the maintenance more difficult.\r\n- Please squash your commits. Usually, PRs are opened with a single commit and new commits are added when feedback is addressed. Before merging a committer squashes these commits. However, it is too much effort to squash more than 50 commits including merge commits which can cause trouble. If multiple contributors worked on a PR, figure out how you can separate the work into one commit per author.\r\n- We have recently reworked our aggregation interface which will also serve as the interface for user-defined aggregations which should also be usable in OVER windows. Please use these aggregation functions. When designing the interface we had their use in OVER windows in mind. If you find that the interface is lacking a method, please start a discussion. However, we cannot have several incompatible aggregation interfaces in the Table API / SQL. Please rebase to the current master and use the new aggregation functions.\r\n- A couple of days ago, we added `PROCTIME()` and `ROWTIME()` methods which should be used to identify the time mode.\r\n- The first OVER window aggregation should serve as a blueprint for future OVER window implementations. We should try to keep the implementations as close as possible to share common code and make the overall maintenance of the code easier.\r\n\r\nMinor comments:\r\n- Why did you check modifications to the `.gitignore` files?\r\n- Please do not remove tests without replacing them with equivalent tests.\r\n- Please do not reformat classes (see FunctionCatalog). These changes cause additional effort when reviewing a PR.\r\n- Do not change ScalaDoc comments to JavaDoc comments in Scala code. \r\nScalaDoc:\r\n```\r\n/**\r\n  * Comment\r\n  */\r\n```\r\nJavaDoc:\r\n```\r\n/**\r\n * Comment\r\n */\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks, Fabian\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/285194946/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/285230134","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3485#issuecomment-285230134","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3485","id":285230134,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NTIzMDEzNA==","user":{"login":"liuyuzhong7","id":24708126,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzA4MTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24708126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyuzhong7","html_url":"https://github.com/liuyuzhong7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyuzhong7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyuzhong7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyuzhong7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyuzhong7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyuzhong7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyuzhong7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyuzhong7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyuzhong7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyuzhong7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-09T01:53:19Z","updated_at":"2017-03-09T01:57:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@StephanEwen It's a good idea.

I didn't see it until a few minutes ago.\r\n\r\nI fully understand your concern. Just let me explain more about your comments.\r\n1. I agree most of your suggestions. Such as null check, formatting problem and TestLogger.\r\n2. Currently synchronize problem will not happen. I think replacing the field value is safe. That's a atomic operation. Correct me if I'm wrong.\r\n3. This PR will not work with other reconciliation PRs. Nobody will notify these listeners. Actually we implemented reconnection between TM and JM. It will work with those codes. The reason I make this PR without other reconciliation PRs is that I think this PR is independent with other parts. I believe filing a huge PR is both terrible for reviewer and writer. However this single PR makes you confused. Sorry about that. \r\n4. Actually I'm not sure listener pattern is the best way to do this. But I think it's the simplest way which makes least modifications of current implementation. If the TM reconnected with new JM, how can we update the JobMasterGateway handled by components? I can't figure out a better way except reimplementing these components.\r\n\r\nAnyway, thank you for reviewing and commenting so many! I agree with you that we should close this PR at this moment. After making an agreement about main reconciliation PRs, we can talk about what this PR try to implement.

We have a few modules (like flink-runtime) which are mixed but didn't make good experience with this design. Also, there is a clear separation in these modules which components are implemented in Java and Scala. I think implementing the flink-table module in a mix of Java and Scala is not a good idea because it makes the maintenance more difficult than sticking to a single language. \r\n\r\nRegarding the squashing. I think the best approach is to create a new branch based on the current master and manually copying over those files that you would like to keep. Most of the code should be new files, so this should not be too much effort. By using the first OVER window as a blueprint I meant that you should try to follow a similar approach by using the same utils and a similar design. IMO, it makes sense if similar features share as much code as possible and follow the same design.\r\n\r\nBest,

You could perhaps review the changes and/or maybe see how to discard empty operator states if you are motivated with a seperate PR (I dont think there is a JIRA for this either). This is the only pending issue to merge this PR .

The problem is that you also want to check that a state handle which fails to retrieve its state, is properly discarded. This discard call happens as part of a callback to a ZooKeeper remove call. Since the curator client uses the builder API to construct the ZooKeeper calls, it was necessary to mock all the different build stages. I couldn't find a more succinct way to test this behaviour without starting a ZooKeeper server.\r\n\r\nIf you think it hurts the test's maintainability too much, then I can start a ZooKeeper server

test.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/285702211/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/285703165","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3510#issuecomment-285703165","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3510","id":285703165,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NTcwMzE2NQ==","user":{"login":"maocorte","id":7325722,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMjU3MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7325722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maocorte","html_url":"https://github.com/maocorte","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maocorte/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maocorte/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maocorte/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maocorte/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maocorte/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maocorte/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maocorte/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maocorte/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maocorte/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-10T15:46:25Z","updated_at":"2017-03-10T15:46:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"thank
