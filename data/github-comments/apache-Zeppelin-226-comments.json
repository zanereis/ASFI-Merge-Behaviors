It will not be easy since there will be a lot of differences because upstream and our branch was evolving separately for some time. I may try to look at this but because of personal issues it may not happen soon. So if you have time and you think that it worth investigating you are welcome to check this as well. If you do not have time right now I may look at this later.\r\n\r\nBut for these experiments I suggest starting new branch from this PR. When we were trying to fix remaining test we often had situation when we fixed something for java 11 but that broke something for Java 8.
