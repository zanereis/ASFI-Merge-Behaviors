You can set disable authentication and authorization and proxy to\ndisable all checks. (Not recommended for production)\n\nb. If authentication and authorization is enabled on Proxy and Broker, and\nif a consume or produce action is via a proxy the\n    - originalPrincipal - will contain Client role name  (aka principal)\n    - authRole - will contain Proxy role name, extracted from\nauthenticationData and authMethod sent by the proxy\n    - Both the Proxy and the end Client *should* have the appropriate\nconsume or produce permissions or else a compromised proxy can mimic any\nclient by just sending a stolen originalPrincipal (string). Or in other\nwords a compromised proxy should not be able to access more data than a\ncompromised client.\n\nb. OriginalPrincipal is just a string and can easily be remanufactured by a\ncompromised proxy, so in order to safeguard the service you can enable  \"\n*forwardAuthorizationCredentials*\" on the proxy and enable \"\n*authenticateOriginalAuthData*\" on the broker.\n    - The proxy will forward the client authenticationData (digital\nsignature with TTL) and authenticationData instead of a string and the\nbroker will authenticate the end client and extract originalPrincipal from\nclient authenticationData.\n\nc. Another scenario could be that the proxy mimics the client by setting\noriginalPrincipal as NULL\n   - In order to prevent that you can set \"*proxyRoles*\" in the broker\nconfiguration.\n\n\nBelow are some links to the configurations you can set. This weekend I will\ngo through the documentation and add any missing pieces (if any).\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-pulsar/blob/master/pulsar-broker-common/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/ServiceConfiguration.java#L247\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-pulsar/blob/master/pulsar-broker-common/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/ServiceConfiguration.java#L251\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-pulsar/blob/master/pulsar-proxy/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/proxy/server/ProxyConfiguration.java#L79\n\nRegards,\nJai\nOn Mon, Jun 25, 2018 at 12:42 PM, Ivan Kelly <notifications@github.com>\nwrote:\n\n> @pckeyan <https://github.com/pckeyan> I'd like to talk to @merlimat\n> <https://github.com/merlimat> & @jai1 <https://github.com/jai1> since\n> they've worked on similar stuff, but the planned fix is to send the\n> original authenticated rolename with the proxied requests, similiar to how\n> we do for the data protocol.

The problem is that the entire test relies on \"beating\" the inherent race conditions between threads: the scheduler thread and the test thread. Since the RateLimiter is just scheduling on the scheduler all we're really accomplishing is testing whether the ScheduledExecutorService is scheduling things at a fixed rate. I agree there should be a \"sanity\" check here that things open/close and that the basic functionality exists but there's not really much here. The RateLimiter talks about why it doesn't use Guava's but I think it might be worth re-evaluating, looking for a different implement library implementation, or paring things down dramatically.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/401569992/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/401570831","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/1303#issuecomment-401570831","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/1303","id":401570831,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMTU3MDgzMQ==","user":{"login":"mgodave","id":556310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NjMxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/556310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgodave","html_url":"https://github.com/mgodave","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgodave/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgodave/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgodave/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgodave/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgodave/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgodave/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgodave/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgodave/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgodave/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-30T22:44:31Z","updated_at":"2018-07-01T00:13:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm looking through the Guava code and documentation to understand if the analysis in Pulsar's implementation is indeed accurate or even matters.
