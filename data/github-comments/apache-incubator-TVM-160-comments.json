In my refactored version, I have no problem with these three. Have a look and try my script below. You can parse the module in two ways and compare the difference.\r\n> https://github.com/masahi/torchscript-to-tvm/blob/master/torchvision_test.py#L51-L60\r\n> \r\n> I guess the issue is in dtype or optional arguments handling in your op conversions. I've prepared [a branch](https://github.com/masahi/tvm/tree/torch-refactor) for the refactoring PR based on your current implementation, and I can reproduce errors on alexnet, vgg and mobilenet v2.\r\n> \r\n> The difference between this branch and the implementation at `torchscript-to-tvm` is mostly on op conversion map, that's why I think problems are there.\r\n\r\nOkay, will check it out. I was assuming the vgg and alexnet errors were due to the topi implementation of one of the adaptive poolings as it didn't seem like any other frontend used these. If it's in op conversion though, that's an easier fix.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/584303447/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/584305730","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4847#issuecomment-584305730","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4847","id":584305730,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NDMwNTczMA==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-10T19:22:51Z","updated_at":"2020-02-10T19:22:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"cc

In my refactored version, I have no problem with these three. Have a look and try my script below. You can parse the module in two ways and compare the difference.\r\n> https://github.com/masahi/torchscript-to-tvm/blob/master/torchvision_test.py#L51-L60\r\n> \r\n> I guess the issue is in dtype or optional arguments handling in your op conversions. I've prepared [a branch](https://github.com/masahi/tvm/tree/torch-refactor) for the refactoring PR based on your current implementation, and I can reproduce errors on alexnet, vgg and mobilenet v2.\r\n> \r\n> The difference between this branch and the implementation at `torchscript-to-tvm` is mostly on op conversion map, that's why I think problems are there.\r\n\r\nI compared the produced relay graph for mobilenet, vgg, and alexnet and they look the same so I'm not sure if it's a parsing issue. VGG and AlexNet have had issues with accuracy but the mobilenet issue is a memory thing I think.\r\n\r\n`\r\nCUDAError: Check failed: ret == 0 (-1 vs. 0) : cuModuleLoadData(&(module_[device_id]), data_.c_str()) failed with error: CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_PTX\r\n`\r\n\r\nI'm reverting to what was passing previously and will re-apply the recent changes later tonight.

The pass infra will skip optimization of them automatically. This is okay for VM. However, for graph runtime, we may need to have an inline pass to inline these global functions, as build_module and graph_runtime_codegen really only focus on the main function and globalvar is not allowed.\r\n- S1: Look at the passes and skip the optimizing `FunctionNode` if the function doesn't use default compiler from TVM\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/blob/4fce5137ddd30ea56d1951703de43727043090b9/src/relay/ir/expr.cc#L168\r\nThis looks a little easier because some passes can ignore this, but it doesn't

As you suggested, the assertion for `lowered_funcs.size()` in the branch assuming that external modules exist should be raised in the current implementation, but what is the expected behaviour when we actually use `CSourceModule` with an empty string? Should we simply remove this assertion since `ret_.mod` exists anyway and won't affect external module importing?\r\n2. This line of code:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/blob/a5661611472c8e92b20bbe4d074333b8183f2878/src/target/source/source_module.cc#L101\r\n\r\nis located in a `SaveToFile` function, which is not called frequently, and the single use case I've noticed:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/blob/fc1a1d83691f7229e25a37befdcd3ad9c3d430b3/tests/cpp/utvm_runtime_standalone_test.cc#L100\r\n\r\nonly exists in test and doesn't trigger that assertsion since `fmt` is `\"o\"`. Even if `fmt` is `\"cc\"`, assuming no such assertion and the string is empty, there should not be any exception caused (at the code level, I'm not sure whether functionally it is expected).

I'm using the external codegen feature which is relatively new. Essentially it allows you to take parts of the Relay graph and run them through a non-TVM compiler. In some cases, we take the entire Relay graph and put it through one of these external compilers resulting in the case where there are no lowered TVM functions. What does get produced though is 'external' runtime modules which correspond to the outputs from these external compilers.\r\n\r\nYou can see this happening in the BuildRelay function. We call 'GetExternalModules' to get those modules that have been produced by external compilers. But to be able to compile these modules into a shared library, we need a 'host' TVM module. This host module then 'imports' in all the external modules, as you can see here:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/blob/a5661611472c8e92b20bbe4d074333b8183f2878/src/relay/backend/build_module.cc#L458\r\n\r\nHowever, if there is no host TVM module (which will happen when there are no lowered funcs), then you can't import the external modules into a host module and accordingly we fail to compile the result to a shared library. So this fix is very helpful by making sure that host module always gets created, even if it's empty, so we can always compile to a shared library.\r\n\r\nNow addressing your questions. For 1, yes I think we just remove this branch entirely and have it always import the external modules. For 2, I hit the assert when trying to call export_library on the 'lib' output of the build function. I believe SaveToFile is called when doing this export, in particular this line:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/blob/79cfab00d1a5ae55b3324dae803d5e1389e12bbe/python/tvm/runtime/module.py#L302\r\nI did try just commenting out the assert and it seems to work. However, I then ran into a new problem... Because what you produce is ostensibly a 'c source' file (even if it's empty), all the external modules are also exported as c files. This results in having to do a proper compile when you try and merge all the modules together to produce a shared library. If one of your external modules happens to be a binary artifact that's 150MB (my case), this compile uses an incredible amount of RAM and takes a long time to complete. I didn't get this problem with your first solution as it used an LLVMModule (I think?) which results in the external modules becoming object files so all you need to do is link, not perform a full compilation.\r\n\r\nSorry for the wall of text, if you have any further questions I'll happily answer them. I realise I may not have perfectly explained everything here :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/585449674/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/585454809","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4847#issuecomment-585454809","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4847","id":585454809,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NTQ1NDgwOQ==","user":{"login":"kumasento","id":8768839,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3Njg4Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8768839?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumasento","html_url":"https://github.com/kumasento","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumasento/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumasento/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumasento/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumasento/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumasento/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumasento/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumasento/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumasento/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumasento/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-12T22:40:37Z","updated_at":"2020-02-12T22:40:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mbarrett97 Thank you for your detailed explanation!
