At some point mockito will release a new version which will bump its dependencies to JDK 24 compatible versions. At that point it will \"just work\" after roller updates the mockito version without having to declare a direct (test) dependency on bytebuddy. That is what I meant by this will fix itself after a while.\r\n\r\n(I manually tested bumping bytebuddy to the latest version and tests passed on JDK 24)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/roller/issues/comments/2629290701/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/roller/issues/comments/2629292651","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/roller/pull/149#issuecomment-2629292651","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/roller/issues/149","id":2629292651,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmdM6ct9Jr","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-02T08:13:37Z","updated_at":"2025-02-02T08:13:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"```\r\nmvn eu.maveniverse.maven.plugins:toolbox:gav-tree -Dgav=org.mockito:mockito-core:5.14.1\r\n[INFO] --- toolbox:0.6.1:gav-tree (default-cli) @ standalone-pom ---\r\n[INFO] org.mockito:mockito-core:jar:5.14.1\r\n[INFO] ├─net.bytebuddy:byte-buddy:jar:1.15.3 [compile]\r\n[INFO] ├─net.bytebuddy:byte-buddy-agent:jar:1.15.3 [compile]\r\n[INFO] ╰─org.objenesis:objenesis:jar:3.3 [runtime]\r\n```\r\n\r\nbtw https://github.com/raphw/byte-buddy/releases/tag/byte-buddy-1.16.0\r\n\r\n> Include support for JDK Class File API.\r\n\r\nbytebuddy 1.16 and later should no longer cause this kind of problem thanks for using plain JDK APIs.
