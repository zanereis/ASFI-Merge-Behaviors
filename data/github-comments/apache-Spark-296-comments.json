@mridulm no, this behavior is not documented. The java SE doc doesn't say anything about ordering.. So before filing the JIRA, I looked up the OpenJDK source code, both 6 and 7.\nMaybe I should post some snippets here.\nIn openjdk-6-src-b27, \njdk/src/windows/native/java/net/NetworkInterface.c Line335-\n\n```\n        /*\n         * Put the interface at tail of list as GetIfTable(,,TRUE) is\n         * returning the interfaces in index order.\n         */\n        count++;\n        if (netifP == NULL) {\n            netifP = curr;\n        } else {\n            netif *tail = netifP;\n            while (tail->next != NULL) {\n                tail = tail->next;\n            }\n            tail->next = curr;\n        }\n\n```\n\njdk/src/solaris/native/java/net/NetworkInterface.c function *addif Line1000\n\n```\n    /*\n     * If \"new\" then create an netif structure and\n     * insert it onto the list.\n     */\n    if (currif == NULL) {\n        currif = (netif *)malloc(sizeof(netif));\n        if (currif) {\n            currif->name = strdup(name);\n            if (currif->name == NULL) {\n                free(currif);\n                currif = NULL;\n            }\n        }\n        if (currif == NULL) {\n            JNU_ThrowOutOfMemoryError(env, \"heap allocation failed\");\n            return ifs;\n        }\n        currif->index = index;\n        currif->addr = NULL;\n        currif->childs = NULL;\n        currif->virtual = isVirtual;\n        currif->next = ifs;\n        ifs = currif;\n    }\n```\n\nOf course, the whole flow is more complicated, but you can get the idea.\nSource code in OpenJDk7 is similar, I won't post it here as this is a long

@pwendell, I don't think this is risky. It's a minor change and at least it don't do worse. \nThe current implementation doesn't pick the more proper ip on my laptop(mac os x) or a Debian. \nOf course, if you don't want to put this into 1.1, I totally get it.
