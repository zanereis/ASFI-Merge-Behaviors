However, this is a Java convention and is not required. If allowing uppercased methods seems like it feels right from a usability perspective for data scientists, we can definitely do that easily.\r\n2) I was attempting to create Scala-style minimalism, but something like _docs/__docs/_source/__source is definitely very easy to do and certainly clearer.\r\n3) Currently the contents for each class are being pulled from the jar file. The file system is not overriding the content of the jar file. 1) and 2) are trivial but 3) is a bit more work but certainly achievable. We should be able to make script and method contents dynamic but the function signatures probably need to stay static due to java classloading issues. It might be good to do 3) as a separate PR.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/298461107/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/298462716","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/473#issuecomment-298462716","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/473","id":298462716,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5ODQ2MjcxNg==","user":{"login":"dusenberrymw","id":5431337,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MzEzMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5431337?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw","html_url":"https://github.com/dusenberrymw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-01T23:51:30Z","updated_at":"2017-05-01T23:51:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"For (1), in particular, I was thinking it would be nice to follow the case of the function *parameters* and return variables defined in the DML.  So for `val dummy = clf.generate_dummy_data()`, I would expect to be able to use `dummy.X`, `dummy.Y`, `dummy.Hin`, etc., just as defined in the DML file.\r\n\r\nFor (2), I agree that the minimalism is great for the current solution.  Let's get some feedback from others as to whether minimalism or verbosity would be better here, as I'm not even completely sure one way or another.  For myself, I understand the current syntax, but I'm just not sure about others.  If we do go with the more verbose way, I think two underscores would be needed, as many of the DML functions will have underscores in the name, and thus a single underscore may just look like another DML function.\r\n\r\nFor (3) yeah the ultimate ideal would be realtime, dynamic generation of everything.  Of course that looks pretty hard, so I think keeping the function signatures static is fine.  Allowing for dynamic function bodies would definitely be extremely useful and needed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/298462716/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/298462768","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/480#issuecomment-298462768","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/480","id":298462768,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5ODQ2Mjc2OA==","user":{"login":"nakul02","id":5394361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzOTQzNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5394361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nakul02","html_url":"https://github.com/nakul02","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nakul02/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nakul02/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nakul02/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nakul02/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nakul02/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nakul02/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nakul02/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nakul02/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nakul02/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-01T23:51:56Z","updated_at":"2017-05-01T23:51:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"LGTM :+1: ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/298462768/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/298468440","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/442#issuecomment-298468440","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/442","id":298468440,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5ODQ2ODQ0MA==","user":{"login":"dusenberrymw","id":5431337,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MzEzMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5431337?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw","html_url":"https://github.com/dusenberrymw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-02T00:34:35Z","updated_at":"2017-05-02T00:34:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@nakul02 Have you been able to successfully run this?

This PR adds a new syntax to DML language, which is useful for implementing SGD-style algorithms:\r\n```R\r\nfor(X_batch in X, nrow=batch_size) {\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Additionally, it allows for prefetching of `X_batch` with the help of the configuration property `prefetch.budget.mb`. The memory specified by this property is subtracted from the local memory budget. This could be a drawback in low-memory settings.\r\n\r\n3. Alternative is to compute the aggregate memory budget of all the child blocks and subtract it from local memory budget to get the prefetch budget. In many cases, the aggregate memory budget will likely be a gross over-estimate of actual memory required as it doesnot take into account the effect of `rmvar` and our caching. We can extend ProgramBlock to compute this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n/**\r\n * Computes the memory estimate if known, else -1.\r\n * If OptimizerUtils.isMemoryBasedOptLevel(), it returns OptimizerUtils.INVALID_SIZE.\r\n * \r\n * @return the memory estimate for this program block \r\n * @throws HopsException if error occurs\r\n */\r\npublic double getMemEstimate() throws HopsException {\r\n\tif(_sb == null) \r\n\t\treturn 0;\r\n\tif(!OptimizerUtils.isMemoryBasedOptLevel())\r\n\t\treturn OptimizerUtils.INVALID_SIZE;\r\n\t\r\n\tdouble memBudget = 0;\r\n\tfor(Hop h : _sb.get_hops()) {\r\n\t\tdouble memEstimateForH = h.getMemEstimate();\r\n\t\tif(memEstimateForH < 0)\r\n\t\t\treturn -1;\r\n\t\telse\r\n\t\t\tmemBudget += memEstimateForH;\r\n\t}\r\n\treturn memBudget;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we can replace `memBudget += h.getMemEstimate();` with `memBudget = max(memBudget, memEstimateForH)` as an optimistic estimate assuming immediate rmvar and/or caching.

touches upon a broader question, i.e., should all explain/stats output go to stdout or the logs? Just to give the history: We had deployments, where SystemML was called in a separate process and writing to stdout would clog up the stdout queue if nobody is reading from it. Hence all output except print/stop goes to the logs. That's also the reason why our scripts have options to write any debug output to text files instead of printing it.
