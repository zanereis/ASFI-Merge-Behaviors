State right now works well if you stick to the (admittedly somewhat hidden) rules. That is, you should only access state if there is a key available.\n\nIf there is no key available the behavior changes in unexpected ways based on what state backend is used and the capabilities of the key serializer. For example, let's look at access to `ValueState` in `open()`. For mem/fs state: `ValueState.value()` works, it will return the default value. `ValueState.update()` will throw a NPE. For RocksDB state: Neither method works if the key serializer cannot handle null values. If it can, then both methods will change state for the `null` key.\n\nFor these reasons I would like to change the semantics of state such that the user always has to call `getState` (or a similar method) and that the returned accessor object is documented to only be valid for the duration of the processing method. Right now, the user can wreak all kinds of havoc by down-casting the returned State object. Right now we have a very simple system that works if the user keeps to the rules and also makes things go fast. If we want to make it more restrictive we will lose some performance, of course.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/200933436/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/200942437","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1820#issuecomment-200942437","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1820","id":200942437,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwMDk0MjQzNw==","user":{"login":"vasia","id":498957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5ODk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/498957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia","html_url":"https://github.com/vasia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-24T17:37:04Z","updated_at":"2016-03-24T17:37:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've rebased on master and will merge once travis turns green :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/200942437/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/200945681","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1831#issuecomment-200945681","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1831","id":200945681,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwMDk0NTY4MQ==","user":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-24T17:45:57Z","updated_at":"2016-03-24T17:46:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I like @aljoscha's idea to separate more explicitly the user state access and it's implementation.
