And more importantly, why are you doing time shifting? Or it is just because of OS timestamp adjusting?\r\n\r\n我们的目标先统一一下：在保证性能的前提下，使`globalId`的全局唯一\r\nOur goal is to unify first: under the premise of ensuring performance, make the `globalId` globally unique\r\n\r\n>  It may be confusing and ugly.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16626084/114315320-0e446c00-9b31-11eb-835b-8c6b7a058b65.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16626084/114315963-00441a80-9b34-11eb-9c75-da1f9a074b87.png)\r\n\r\n文档中说明是用`timestamp`, 显然`timestamp`不可能是负数的。\r\n函数名是`nextSeq`, `sequence` 作为负数也很奇怪。\r\n另外“-”在很多情况下被当做是分隔符，突然在这里出现会很奇怪\r\nThe document states that `timestamp` is used. Obviously, `timestamp` cannot be a negative number.\r\nThe function name is `nextSeq`, and it is strange that `sequence` is a negative number.\r\nIn addition, \"-\" is used as a separator in many cases, it would be strange to suddenly appear here\r\n\r\n> It may produce a conflict timestamp while using random.\r\n> If we are going to discuss conflict, then, I would say negative is even better? Because we would have a negative value in a normal case.\r\n\r\n如果时间回拨多次，使用随机数，这有一定的概率会冲突(虽然很小).\r\n现在的时间戳是1618164032218，已经超出了Integer的范围，所以随机数 `nextInt(0, Integer.MAX_VALUE)` 不会和正常的时间戳冲突.\r\nIf the time is called back multiple times and a random number is used, there is a certain probability that it will conflict (albeit very small).\r\nThe current timestamp is 1618164032218, which has exceeded the range of Integer, so the random number `nextInt(0, Integer.MAX_VALUE)` will not conflict with the normal timestamp.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16626084/114315812-303eee00-9b33-11eb-8c49-8543550b1ed0.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n> why are you doing time shifting? Or it is just because OS timestamp adjusting?\r\n\r\nOS时间变更或者时间校对是很难完全避免的。既然我们代码里面处理了时间回拨问题，是可以做进一步的优化的。\r\nIt is difficult to completely avoid OS time changes or time proofreading. Since our code handles the time-callback problem, it can be further optimized.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/817349195/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/817413037","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/6728#issuecomment-817413037","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/6728","id":817413037,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxNzQxMzAzNw==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-12T01:00:48Z","updated_at":"2021-04-12T01:00:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> The document states that timestamp is used.

Maybe our configuration could be more comfortable. The satellite has multi-pipes to process different telemetry data. The log pipe is only one of them. So I'm cautious about plug-in sharing

Thanks!\r\n\r\nNow I am getting Entry span and few local spans. \r\n\r\nScenario 1:\r\nA is calling B and A is calling C. These are all in the same instance/jvm. \r\nSo I am creating A as the entry span, B and C as local spans. ie A is the parent to both B&C. So far so good. \r\nHow can the sequence of local spans achieved ? ie I want to know that B is called first and then C. Is there an option? I can see the reference is only to A.\r\n\r\nScenario 2:\r\nA is calling B of the same instance/jvm. But B is calling C of different process, in a different JVM.\r\nSo A is an entry span, B is a local span. C is again an entry span.\r\nWhen I check the reference, I can see that C has the reference to B.\r\nNow I was to show/read them in two different ways.\r\n1. For high level, I want to show only the processes/jvms included, ie I want to show only A -> C\r\n2. For those who want to see in detail,  then I want to show A -> B -> C\r\n\r\n1 can be achieved if I don't initiate the local span for B. But it is needed for scenario 2.
