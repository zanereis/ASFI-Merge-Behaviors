E.g. batchnorm.st.\r\n\r\nThese files are string templates. If I place license in these files, the license will go into the generated code. \r\n\r\n> Some sort of guidance/document on how the translator internally works will be useful since from what I see there are bunch of components for this translator. Such details will help 1. reviewers better do the review and 2. for anyone else who wants to fix any issues with the translator later on when you are not around.\r\n\r\n> Do you think having better class docs would be helpful for anyone trying to maintain the code?\r\n\r\n\r\nTotally agree. These are on my list but haven't had the time to do it. Will get to it after the first release. \r\n\r\n> No unit tests?\r\n\r\nUnit tests unfortunately is tricky to write. For example, to test the convolution layer generator, I could do some string processing on the output to validate it but that will be too fragile (will break when output changes a little). Ideally, test code should use MXNet to load the generated symbol and verify it but loading incomplete networks (like just one layer) might not be possible. Testing the generated code using a parser is a chicken-egg problem. \r\n\r\nThat said, I do have tests at macro level - tests that will translate a full caffe network, run training using the generated code and test for convergence. Those tests are available [here](https://github.com/indhub/caffe_translator_tests). I haven't created a PR for those yet because I need to figure out some licensing related issues. The test code translates some Caffe example code taken from Caffe repo and tests for convergence. I need to figure out what I need to do to use caffe example code for testing without infringing on the license. Planning to merge these tests after the first release. \r\n\r\n> Do you think it'll be good to exit in case of exceptions like this or this? Basically fail fast in case of issues? Or would it make more sense to generate a code-comment which says \"// Couldn't convert lr policy\" and continue. Also, with that in mind, what do you think about having a force flag to the translator which if present ignores such errors and continues instead of exiting?\r\n\r\nIn the first case, it will be nice to print a error message saying the caffe prototxt is not well formated. The translator currently assumes the Caffe code is well formatted and it is runnable using Caffe. \r\n\r\nIn the second case, it will be nice to add a comment to the generated code indicating the problem. \r\n\r\nYou are right.  Adding a comment in the generated code or printing to the console and proceeding with the translation is more preferable than aborting. This is because, as a user, the generated code is helpful to me even if certain parts is not translated. I can manually add few lines to complete the translation. \r\n\r\nThese changes are now done. \r\n\r\n> Probably integrate FAQ with the main README since main README doesn't have too much info? (this may just be my personal preference though).\r\n\r\nI'll move the list of supported layers to README. Will leave the question about why caffe in the FAQ page. I don't think that is important enough for the README page. I do get your point about there being less content in faq. But more might get added by the time this work is complete.\r\n\r\n> Out of curiosity what happens when this returns null?\r\n\r\nIf there is no data layer in the Caffe prototxt (maybe because the prototxt uses ImageData), this could return null. In that case, the generated code will not have a data iterator. Supporting more data layers like ImageData is in the roadmap but not for the first release.\r\n\r\n> Generally good to have braces for if statements even if it contains only one statement. Also spaces b/w if and () would be good everywhere. See google braces guide and whitespace guide for more. I'm assuming fixing now would require too much effort w/o giving enough in return so feel free to choose accordingly.\r\n\r\nFixed.\r\n\r\n> I'm seeing some inconsistencies regarding use of final modifier. E.g. here and here.
