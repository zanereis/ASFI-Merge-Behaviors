My zipkin version is 2.21.7.\r\n\r\nLet me explain it with this simple trace. This is a clean trace without any problems, like we want to have it. \r\n![trace_full](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5988272/97496941-053c5580-196a-11eb-80a0-f83001881871.png)\r\nDownload: https://gist.github.com/stuckyhm/ecf9b66ef8a0f6b3b441b1dacb94eb1f#file-trace_full-json\r\n\r\nBut sometimes it isn't so easy and spans are going lost. There are saveral reasons for this, which zipkin is basically not responsible for.\r\n- There may be a network outage, especially if you are using UDP for transport.\r\n- There may be an missconfiguration in an service (e.g. wrong zipkin api url).\r\n- There may be an bug in the instrumentation.\r\n- There may be an incorrect integration of the instrumentation.\r\n\r\nAll this and some more could be a reason for lossing spans. Let us asume the spans 1 and 2 are missing. Zipkin will render the trace like this:\r\n![trace_missing_spans](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5988272/97496971-12594480-196a-11eb-8a58-e37b97307735.png)\r\nDownload: https://gist.github.com/stuckyhm/e06bfddaf265e5a9546ca42b777c6cdd#file-trace_missing_spans-json\r\n\r\nIt isn't usefull anymore. You can say: Fix that instrumentation and try it again. \r\n\r\nThis is good advice and needs to be done, but it does not help us with our current problem that we are trying to analyze. It needs time to fix the instrumentation and possibly redeploy of one or more services. Time we in this moment not have. Monitoring and tracing has often not the highest priority. Or worse, it's a third-party module that we can't fix and we have to wait for the vendor.\r\n\r\nOur job is to deal with errors and bugs. So zipkin should be more tolerant of faulty traces.\r\n\r\nMy idea is to add dynamically an dummy span that collects this multi maybe root spans. It could look like this:\r\n![trace_missing_spans_patch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5988272/97497007-20a76080-196a-11eb-9ba4-2532bad1e220.png)\r\n\r\nI created a simple patch for the file _src/zipkin/span-node.js_ that can do this. Please take look if this is a way we can go. \r\nhttps://gist.github.com/stuckyhm/dc8c696b0d0addbb64d08b1cd8fbc5e9#file-span-node-js-patch\r\n\r\nIf you agree with me I can create a pull request. I will then try to create the tests for it. And I'm not sure if this is the right position for this fix.\r\n\r\nI am happy to hear from you.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/718236303/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/718286384","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3141#issuecomment-718286384","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3141","id":718286384,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxODI4NjM4NA==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-29T00:35:04Z","updated_at":"2020-10-29T00:35:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I was wrong.. multi-arch is 2 manifests, but they count as a single pull request https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/download-rate-limit/","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/718286384/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/718287864","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3141#issuecomment-718287864","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3141","id":718287864,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxODI4Nzg2NA==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-29T00:40:34Z","updated_at":"2020-10-29T01:02:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The current requests for multi-arch boil down to rpi k8s cluster and the https://dapr.io/ project.

We have a \"synthetic root node\" heuristic check.

EG move the prior to a child of a new root node, and perhaps set a boolean \"multipleRoots\" to prevent later duplicate roots from asserting themselves.\r\n\r\nIn other words, we want to retain the behavior of synthetic root when there is no root (existing tests pass)\r\nwe add a behaviour of multiple roots are under a synthetic root (new tests I guess)\r\nthen finally a visualization for either of the above cases, but more importantly when there are multiple roots.\r\n\r\nI don't know if UX wise a fake root span is better or a different rendering, but a fake root span like you are showing here is probably fine.\r\n\r\nHope these notes lead in the right way and are relevant.

Since we're a small team, we don't implement new storage features lightly unless there's very high and obvious demand for it. \r\n\r\nClosing, feel free to reopen if you still feel strongly about this, or consider raising a PR to get things going.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/720127780/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/720131369","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1839#issuecomment-720131369","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1839","id":720131369,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyMDEzMTM2OQ==","user":{"login":"jorgheymans","id":193792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Mzc5Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/193792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgheymans","html_url":"https://github.com/jorgheymans","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgheymans/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgheymans/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgheymans/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgheymans/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgheymans/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgheymans/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgheymans/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgheymans/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgheymans/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-01T18:26:21Z","updated_at":"2020-11-01T18:26:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing, as the linked issue #1492 contains the useful discussion.
