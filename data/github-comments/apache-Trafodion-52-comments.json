The code to add coprocessor classes at the time of creating HTable instance is removed because it would be drag to instantiate HTable/Table for every hbase operation.  It is a non-issue with Trafodion tables because the TableDescription should have added coprocessor classes automatically at the time of create.  The vanilla hbase table access via Trafodion engine will be non-transactional unless the Trafodion co-processor classes are added to the HTableDescriptor via hbase shell.\n\nFor the existing customers who had created Trafodion tables in the very early release of Trafodion also need to add coprocessor classes via hbase shell.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/245793539/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/245795252","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/690#issuecomment-245795252","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/690","id":245795252,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NTc5NTI1Mg==","user":{"login":"Traf-Jenkins","id":12548626,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQ4NjI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12548626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/Traf-Jenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-09T01:48:35Z","updated_at":"2016-09-09T01:48:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Test

In one case there was a growth in mem on the C++ side too. RSS memory as reported by TOP grew to 3 GB for mxosrvr. I have a gcore and will analyze that next. In my test env, I did not observe a similar growth on C++ side, but that could be because I did not run the query sufficient number of times. I will try it out, and if additional issues are found, I hope it can be addressed in a different PR. Thank you for the review and help in understanding this problem.\n\nFor the comment by @DaveBirdsall : This used be a bug in gcc, which has been fixed in the version of gcc we use. Please see https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=28178 . I also tested by explicitly adding this line to the method that was changed. There was no untoward behaviour. Thank you for the review, I had the same question as I was adding  that line, but went on without doing these checks.\njni->DeleteLocalRef(jniResult);\njni->DeleteLocalRef(NULL); // new temp line for sanity check.
