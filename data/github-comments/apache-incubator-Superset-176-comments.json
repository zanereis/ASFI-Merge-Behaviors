One work around here would simply be changing the meta data for your table to set the (currently numeric column) to be a time column. After that it should show up as an option for the vis. \r\n\r\nI also don't think there's any limitation currently for granularity. Perhaps in the time filter section you see a granularity option? But the vis itself doesn't care and should support any event timestamp (at ms level, s level, etc.) \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/433567066/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/433568060","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/6153#issuecomment-433568060","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/6153","id":433568060,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMzU2ODA2MA==","user":{"login":"youngyjd","id":26216756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjE2NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26216756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngyjd","html_url":"https://github.com/youngyjd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngyjd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngyjd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngyjd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngyjd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngyjd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngyjd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngyjd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngyjd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngyjd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-26T23:22:09Z","updated_at":"2018-10-26T23:22:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@betodealmeida Comments addressed.
