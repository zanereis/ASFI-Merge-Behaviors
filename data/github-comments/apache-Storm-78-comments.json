problem here is one of classpath hell. The reason someone wants their jar first in the classpath is because there is a conflict between something that storm provides and something that the worker wants.  In some cases the developers of the dependency in question have maintained binary backwards compatibility and this will work fine, but in too many cases, i.e. guava, compatibility is not maintained. If the incompatibility results in a method not found error or something like that it is simple to debug, but I have seen issues, like with disruptor, where the errors are a lot more subtle, and everything mostly works.  Debugging those over a mailing list when I don't really know what dependencies storm is running against is a real pain. \n\nI am fine with having the option to make the user jar first on the classpath, but I would want it to be off by default.  @emidln if you want to do that please file a JIRA for it at https://issues.apache.org/jira under STORM and then update the title of the pull request to include the JIRA number, i.e. `STORM-XXXX: optionally let stormjar.jar fist on

\"error\" command in ShellSpout</p>\n\n<p>    Addresses JIRA issue <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-796\" title=\"The \"error\" command isn&#39;t supported on ShellSpout\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-796\"><del>STORM-796</del></a>(<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-796\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-796</a>). </p>\n\n<p>    The symptoms a multi-lang user will see here is that if their Spout throws an error and their multi-lang implementation sends an \"error\" command up to the ShellSpout, the ShellSpout will respond saying that it doesn't recognize the \"error\" command, and thus it will crash (while swallowing the exception thrown by the underlying multi-lang component).</p>\n\n<p>    ShellBolt already supports the error command, and ShellSpout already has a way of reporting errors &#8211; so this was just a matter of adding similar logic to the ShellSpout.</p>\n\n\n<p>You can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:</p>\n\n<p>    $ git pull <a
