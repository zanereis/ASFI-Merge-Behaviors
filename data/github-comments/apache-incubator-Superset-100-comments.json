After looking deeper into the problem, I realized that the problem is not that the ```temp table``` can't be created in SQL lab and actually the message ```The query returned no data``` is normal. However the real problem is that the created temp table can't be used in the successive queries. For example if I run the following query blocks in SQL lab\r\n```SQL\r\n-- query block 1\r\n-- dummy table is just a copy of customer table\r\ncreate temp table dummy\r\nas\r\n(\r\nselect user_id\r\nfrom customer\r\n)\r\n;\r\n\r\n-- query block 2\r\nselect * from dummy \r\n``` \r\nI will get the expected result. However if I first run query block 1 and then query block 2, I will receive error message indicating table ```dummy``` does't exist. From Redshift temp table [documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_CREATE_TABLE_NEW.html):\r\n> ...creates a temporary table that is visible only within the current session. The table is automatically dropped at the end of the session in which it is created\r\n\r\nI am starting to wonder how SQL lab handles \"session\". Does each SQL lab run re-connect to the database (start a new session) or it uses the same connection throughout the time when user is still logged in?  For most of the use cases, I think it is more convenient to enable SQL lab user to first create a temp table and then use it afterwards. Is it possible to achieve this?
