would propose a slightly different refactoring:\n\nDoFnReflector = DoFn reflection entry point\nDoFnSignature = Description of the DoFn generated by DoFnReflector\n(Right now this is represented as an instance of DoFnReflector, so this change is essentially separating the static parts of \"do the reflection\" from the non-static parts of \"represent the information we got\")\n\nDoFnInvoker = The interface for invoking a DoFn\nDoFnInvokers = A factory for generating a DoFnInvoker from a DoFnSignature\n(The byte buddy code moves here)\n\nThis seems like a slightly cleaner separation of the distinct phases:\n1. DoFnReflector can produce a DoFnSignature which describes the DoFn\n2.

@dhalperi for a final review.\n\nThank you @wikier. It is great that your change gives us integration with maven.\n\nThat said there are a few issues with the version management part. These should NOT block the merging of this PR. I will work on a follow up PR right after this is merged to address those.\n\nAs a note the issues are `get_version_from_pom` and `sync_version` are not called from anywhere.

Alternatively we could give PipelineOptions an \"id\" and use a static map \"id\" -> PipelineOptions instance and it would be upto workers to populate all of them.\n\nSetters still make sense with static value providers but I could see why setters should not be allowed for this type if all we wanted was runtimevalueproviders. Need to think it through further.\n\nAnnotations as a separate PR sounds good since you should be able to add support for something like List<List<Integer>> which will naturally extend to the ValueProvider.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/239951468/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/239954530","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/831#issuecomment-239954530","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/831","id":239954530,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzOTk1NDUzMA==","user":{"login":"tgroh","id":429866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/429866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh","html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-15T23:00:07Z","updated_at":"2016-08-15T23:00:07Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"LGTM\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/239954530/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/239955097","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/833#issuecomment-239955097","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/833","id":239955097,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzOTk1NTA5Nw==","user":{"login":"vikkyrk","id":1114748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTQ3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1114748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikkyrk","html_url":"https://github.com/vikkyrk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikkyrk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikkyrk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikkyrk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikkyrk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikkyrk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikkyrk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikkyrk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikkyrk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikkyrk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-15T23:03:38Z","updated_at":"2016-08-15T23:03:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"R: @dhalperi \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/239955097/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/239955240","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/825#issuecomment-239955240","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/825","id":239955240,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzOTk1NTI0MA==","user":{"login":"vikkyrk","id":1114748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTQ3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1114748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikkyrk","html_url":"https://github.com/vikkyrk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikkyrk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikkyrk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikkyrk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikkyrk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikkyrk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikkyrk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikkyrk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikkyrk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikkyrk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-15T23:04:31Z","updated_at":"2016-08-15T23:04:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@dhalperi sounds good.
