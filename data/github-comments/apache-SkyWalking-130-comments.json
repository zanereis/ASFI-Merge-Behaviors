Don't use `localhost: port` ever. That will break the topology. The design is based on container-based or micro-service based architecture, so basically, no localhost is being called, all service should be discovered by register center or DNS.\r\n\r\nThat is , if our  hosts has  only one different unique IP,  but  our service  \"xxx-xxx-api\" calls service \"xxx-xxx-wms\" use \"http://localhost:80/api\" , Is the topology still broken ?  because skywalking Unable to distinguish the api url  from diffrent services between each other.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/550595455/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/550616733","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/3792#issuecomment-550616733","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/3792","id":550616733,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MDYxNjczMw==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-07T03:14:06Z","updated_at":"2019-11-07T03:14:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Yes, that is the right expression.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/550616733/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/550901308","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/3797#issuecomment-550901308","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/3797","id":550901308,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MDkwMTMwOA==","user":{"login":"rainbend","id":26432832,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDMyODMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26432832?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rainbend","html_url":"https://github.com/rainbend","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rainbend/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rainbend/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rainbend/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rainbend/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rainbend/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rainbend/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rainbend/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rainbend/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rainbend/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-07T06:41:54Z","updated_at":"2019-11-07T06:41:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"/run ci","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/550901308/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/550989965","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/3803#issuecomment-550989965","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/3803","id":550989965,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MDk4OTk2NQ==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-07T09:10:11Z","updated_at":"2019-11-07T09:10:11Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"We need to fix async http first.
