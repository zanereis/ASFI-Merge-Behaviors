why do you think 10 should be the global default\n\nFor the majority of use cases we've encountered for Zipkin, we've found that 10 result traces is more than adequate to answer whatever question is being investigated. It seems like a situation where 100 results would be desired or necessary would be fairly rare (although now I'm curious if the typical usage pattern that we haven't yet employed very often is casting a wide net to have a higher chance of finding outliers with a higher duration? In our system we are more frequently wanting to find out, was the data received and where was it delivered to?) The order of magnitude difference in performance is also fairly compelling. For a query with no annotations, limit=100 takes about 1 to 1.5s but limit=10 takes about 50-75ms (as measured by the new timers separately added in https://github.com/twitter/zipkin/pull/444). So the web UI responsiveness is a lot snappier and looks a little less cluttered with no need for scrolling.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/117820488/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/117822290","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/443#issuecomment-117822290","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/443","id":117822290,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNzgyMjI5MA==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-01T21:00:00Z","updated_at":"2015-07-01T21:00:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I can make the change internal to twitter to set our default to 100 on deployment, if necessary.

Using a sample of 10, it's going to be pretty unlikely that you'll see the problem.  For very small systems, which don't have as deep hierarchies, it's not as bad, but in that kind of situation, it calls into question why we use zipkin at all.\n\nWith that said, as a basic debugging tool, if you're assuming all queries are alike, 10 clearly makes sense.  My concern is that one of the main use cases of zipkin is for surfacing interesting traces, and it's difficult to do that with such a small sample-size.\n\nI'd be interested in knowing:\n\nA.

I'm on the way home, and formulating a more detailed comment.  I'll update in about 4 hours (after sending daughter to dreamland).\n\n---\n\nThanks for taking a look at HikariCP.  While HikariCP is probably best known for being _fast_, we have actually spent more effort on achieving that speed _within the constraints_ of providing the _highest reliability_ possible.  We are confident that HikariCP is not slightly more reliable, but substantially more reliable than currently available pools.\n\nMany (most?) available pools (including DBCP) default to a mode of operation where performance is prioritized over reliability.  In contrast, HikariCP has no \"unsafe\" operational modes -- no way to disable \"correct\" behavior.\n\nThe [benchmark](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/brettwooldridge/HikariCP/Benchmarks.png) cited on our page is actually extremely generous to other pools.  They are run against a JDBC stub-driver  in which every operation is an empty method.  When a real driver is put into the loop instead, the difference in results begs believability -- but believe them.  We should probably beat this drum more loudly, but...\n\nSo, what is unfair about the typical comparison?  I'm going to talk about HikariCP, Apache DBCP2, and Tomcat DBCP here; talking some about speed, and then bringing in the reliability pieces.  Running HikariCP-benchmark against the three pools against a real database (MySQL) instead of a stub.\n\nFirst, all three pools in default configuration (+ autocommit=false):\n\n```\nBenchmark                                             (jdbcUrl)  (pool)   Mode   Score\nConnectionBench.cycleCnnection  jdbc:mysql://192.168.20.15/test  hikari  thrpt   45289.116  ops/ms\nConnectionBench.cycleCnnection  jdbc:mysql://192.168.20.15/test  tomcat  thrpt    2329.692  ops/ms\nConnectionBench.cycleCnnection  jdbc:mysql://192.168.20.15/test  dbcp2   thrpt      21.750  ops/ms\n```\n\n#### DBCP2\n\nWhat is not visible here is that DBCP2 is generating ~3MB/sec of traffic to the DB, because `rollbackOnReturn` defaults to `true` and it is unconditionally rolling back.  It gets bonus points for defaulting on the side of safety.  Unfortunately, it is not validating connections on borrow.\n\n#### HikariCP\n\nHikariCP is generating zero traffic to the DB.  HikariCP also defaults to \"rollback on return\" (it can't be turned off because that is the _correct_ behavior for a pool), but it additionally tracks transaction state and does not rollback if the SQL has already been committed (or no SQL was run).  HikariCP also defaults to \"test on borrow\" (it can't be turned off...), but employs an optimization that says, \"If a connection had activity within the past 1000ms, bypass connection validation.\"\n\n#### Tomcat\n\nTomcat DBCP is also generating zero traffic to the DB, but for a different reason.  It simply is not validating connections at all, nor is it rolling back on return.\n\n---\n\nNow, let's try to level the playing field as a little.  For Tomcat and DBCP, we need to enable connection validation.\n\n```\nBenchmark                                             (jdbcUrl)  (pool)   Mode   Score\nConnectionBench.cycleCnnection  jdbc:mysql://192.168.20.15/test  hikari  thrpt   45289.116  ops/ms\nConnectionBench.cycleCnnection  jdbc:mysql://192.168.20.15/test  tomcat  thrpt    2133.992  ops/ms\nConnectionBench.cycleCnnection  jdbc:mysql://192.168.20.15/test  dbcp2   thrpt       5.296  ops/ms\n```\n\n#### DBCP2\n\nDBCP2 took a hit here, because it does not have a validation optization like HikariCP.  It is still generating ~3MB/sec of traffic to the DB.\n\n#### Tomcat\n\nTomcat DBCP _does_ support a similar optimzation to HikariCP, the config goes something like this:\n\n```\nsetTestOnBorrow(true)\nsetValidationInterval(1000)\nsetValidator( validator )\n```\n\nBut we forgot \"rollback on return\" for Tomcat:\n\n```\nConnectionBench.cycleCnnection  jdbc:mysql://192.168.20.15/test  tomcat  thrpt      20.706  ops/ms\n```\n\nAnd there goes the performance.  Tomcat is now generating ~3MB/sec of traffic to the DB.  It does not track transaction state and therefore must unconditionally rollback.

Probes Open API approach to API library design would be a good starting point...if not the reference itself.

Other than the single class there is not dependency on an actual implementation.\n\nThe Probes Open API also shows how best to implementation extension points. Please look at Strategy, Interceptor,...\n\nI am going to write an article that shows how easy it is to extend the metering runtime via the Interceptor Extension API to publish all method call spans to the existing Zipkin Collector.

My advice would be to create a separate issue for moving to the probes api, if that's your goal. It would be less distracting and also easier to find in the issues list.\n\nmy 2p on where the idea of probes-api convergence:\n\nThe idea of a general api for JVM-based tracing implementations is also broader than zipkin itself, as it crossed HTrace, Pinpoint, and other Dapper clones. It may well be the case that all of the dapper clones no longer wish to be dapper clones and instead probes api implementors, but that's still not great to have as a sidebar here. Such a goal would only be implementable if each of the projects had an explicit desire to do that. I'm not sure all are there, yet. How about opening an issue in https://github.com/autoletics/probes-api issues list, to demonstrate the value of converging perhaps with an adapter? That way instead of telling people what's best, they would be able to see that it is best and ask for it. Regardless, the engagement and visibility of the probes-api project would increase as a result, which could only help your aim which is to make this a standard api.\n\nI'm sure you have feedback on my advice, but I'm concerned that this thread will be distracted further.
