Maybe a new PR is needed to meet your needs.\r\nIMO, I think your requirement is sensible in some way.

Besides, `clear()` is also expected to be called by the user themselves.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n/**\r\n     * Get a new instance for {@code HintManager}.\r\n     *\r\n     * @return  {@code HintManager} instance\r\n     */\r\n    public static HintManager getInstance() {\r\n        Preconditions.checkState(null == HINT_MANAGER_HOLDER.get(), \"Hint has previous value, please clear first.\");\r\n        // TODO You should pay more attention here.\r\n        HintManager result = new HintManager();\r\n        HINT_MANAGER_HOLDER.set(result);\r\n        return result;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n**BTW, do you want to have a try to fix this issue by yourself?
