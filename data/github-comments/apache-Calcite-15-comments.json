For this I added CustomFilter and CustomProject as implementations of Filter and Project interfaces. Similarly, I had to pass in a custom RelBuilderFactory to SqltoRelConverter config as by default it uses RelFactories.LOGICAL_BUILDER which has all the default factories. The test case has implementations of Custom filter and project factory.\r\n\r\nOne problem I have been facing is that SqlToRelConverter has hardcoded the filter factory to be used as default filter factor in RelFactories and thus the custom implementation doesn't get used for Filter. If you look at the test case plan in RelOptRulesTest.xml, you can see that the plan now has \"MyProject\" instead of \"LogicalProject\" but it is still having \"LogicalFilter\" because of this hardcoded factory in SqlToRelConverter at line#990\r\n\r\nI couldn't really find a way of extracting the configured filter factor in SqlToRelConverter config -- something like config.getRelBuilderFactory.getFilterFactory(). AFAIK, there is probably no way of getting the specific factory class and using that instead of hardcoding to LogicalFilter factory.\r\n\r\nCan you please advise how this can be fixed?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/478755526/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/478759476","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/1033#issuecomment-478759476","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/1033","id":478759476,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3ODc1OTQ3Ng==","user":{"login":"siddharthteotia","id":2150694,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTA2OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2150694?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia","html_url":"https://github.com/siddharthteotia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-01T21:44:56Z","updated_at":"2019-04-01T21:44:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @siddharthteotia there are build failures.

Can't you use something like:\r\n> `final RelNode filter = relBuilder.filter(convertedWhere2);`\r\n> or\r\n> `relBuilder.push(bb.root);`\r\n> `final RelNode filter = relBuilder.filter(convertedWhere2);`\r\n> for instance?\r\n> I didn't really look how the relBuilder is used previously but I guess should be something similar.\r\n\r\nThanks @zabetak , I was able to use the factory in RelBuilder. I have addressed the other comments as well.
