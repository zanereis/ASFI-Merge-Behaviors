The problem is not that the query takes 5 minutes... (it's an incredibly small and simple query that takes a tenth of a second to return the table view). The problem is that it **never** renders a map. \n\nNever.\n\nAnd it's not because of the query size or complexity, so profiling the query is time misspent. Is it a simple fix? Is there a way to simply force the correct Country encoding when the world-map is initially selected? Perhaps! But, I haven't found how to do that in the roughly 4 hours I've spent on this one visualization.\n\nAs for spending my own time on it trying to fix it: I plan to. However, I spent last week assessing Caravel: whether we wanted to use it internally and whether we wanted to recommend it to our clients, and I give my report tomorrow. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/250993346/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/250998771","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/1231#issuecomment-250998771","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/1231","id":250998771,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MDk5ODc3MQ==","user":{"login":"williaster","id":4496521,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0OTY1MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4496521?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster","html_url":"https://github.com/williaster","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-02T21:53:15Z","updated_at":"2016-10-02T21:53:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @jasonshah, we're currently discussing the addition of a feature like this internally.

Having recreated the sankey table from the example dataset, a new permission has appeared, so I can grant access to it via the public role. Might be worth stating this in the docs, as out of the box, you cannot assign permissions to the tables from the example data.\n\nRe multiple roles, [the security docs](http://airbnb.io/caravel/security.html) give an example of using a 'finance' role to give access to a specific dataset/table to some users. This makes a lot of sense to me, so admin/alpha/gamma roles are used to say what a user can do, and custom roles can be used to allow access to specific datasets.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/251969794/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/251970518","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/1272#issuecomment-251970518","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/1272","id":251970518,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MTk3MDUxOA==","user":{"login":"xrmx","id":12932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx","html_url":"https://github.com/xrmx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-06T14:03:08Z","updated_at":"2016-10-06T14:03:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"PR clarifying the docs much appreciated! :)\n\nRe multiple roles, what i was trying to say is choose one of the default caravel roles and add your specific roles on top of them.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/251970518/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/251978836","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/1273#issuecomment-251978836","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/1273","id":251978836,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MTk3ODgzNg==","user":{"login":"xrmx","id":12932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx","html_url":"https://github.com/xrmx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-06T14:26:44Z","updated_at":"2016-10-06T14:26:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@samempson could you please double check that saving again a table created with load_examples does the trick?
