The interesting bit will be integration into the existing classes. But ignoring everything else you verified, that the JNA libraries actually work on win-aarch64, that should have been the case, but geting the info first hand is nice.  Thank you!\n\nI experiented a bit with this the last two hours and initially I thought I broke the DDE client, until I realized, that neither Edge, nor Firefox support DDE anymore and while switching from the c++ code to java code I removed some exception guards I'll need to readd.\n\nUnfinished/only preliminary tessted branch: https://github.com/matthiasblaesing/netbeans/commit/33eafba45441d4f548870148d232029fa2eeb873","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2634992778/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2635909519","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/8206#issuecomment-2635909519","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/8206","id":2635909519,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6dHMmP","user":{"login":"lahodaj","id":51319204,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzE5MjA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51319204?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lahodaj","html_url":"https://github.com/lahodaj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lahodaj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lahodaj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lahodaj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lahodaj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lahodaj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lahodaj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lahodaj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lahodaj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lahodaj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-05T07:27:43Z","updated_at":"2025-02-05T07:27:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sorry for belated answer.
