This line in the `ArrayList`'s `grow()` method:\r\n```java\r\nelementData = Arrays.copyOf(elementData, newCapacity);\r\n```\r\nLacks a write barrier between `Arrays.copyOf()` and the assignment. It means that a parallel thread may read the new array from the `elementData` field before seeing effects of `Arrays.copyOf()`. This could be fixed by creating a minimal implementation of `ArrayList` with `volatile` `elementData` (without any CAS or CoW logic that I mentioned earlier).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/420589298/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/420627238","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/6322#issuecomment-420627238","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6322","id":420627238,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMDYyNzIzOA==","user":{"login":"kaijianding","id":8663725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NjM3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8663725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijianding","html_url":"https://github.com/kaijianding","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijianding/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijianding/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijianding/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijianding/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijianding/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijianding/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijianding/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijianding/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijianding/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-12T12:18:59Z","updated_at":"2018-09-12T12:18:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@leventov for the ArrayList part, I don't think it is a problem, because size++ happens after grow().

However, it still only operates on a single supervisor.\r\n\r\nAdditionally it deprecates the 'shutdown' api call in favor of a new 'terminate' call, which we thought more closely aligned with it's

Before your PR, every time I did some changes and went to update druid nodes, I used `shutdown` API to terminate all supervisors first.  This cause stored supervisors will not be loaded when I restart druid nodes because `shutdown` API insert a `NoopSupervisorSpec`. Suspend/resume functionality are what I really want! \r\n\r\nI'll modify this PR to have 3 \"all\" endpoints just as what you suggested.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/421286564/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/421300014","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/6327#issuecomment-421300014","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6327","id":421300014,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMTMwMDAxNA==","user":{"login":"sanastas","id":12136181,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTM2MTgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12136181?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanastas","html_url":"https://github.com/sanastas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanastas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanastas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanastas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanastas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanastas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanastas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanastas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanastas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanastas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-14T09:52:51Z","updated_at":"2018-09-14T09:52:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you, Roman (@leventov )!
