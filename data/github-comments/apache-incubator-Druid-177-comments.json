Can when the good vs bad cases would be encountered be expanded more?\r\n\r\nSure. ValueMatchers are for so-called \"post filtering\" which means filtering during a row scan, rather than using the index.\r\n\r\nImagine a filter like `WHERE col1 = 'foo' AND col2 LIKE '%bar%'` where col1 and col2 are both unindexed (so we need to do ValueMatcher filtering for both). The good case is where within the set of rows where col1 is 'foo', you don't see the entire constellation of possible col2 values. It means lazy matching saves a lot of time. The good case should be very common for multi-tenant type datasets (imagine `WHERE customer_id = '123' AND product_id = '456'` if products are unique to customers).\r\n\r\nThe bad case is where this does not happen: where there is no pruning of col2 values based on a col1 filter. In this case, laziness doesn't save any time.\r\n\r\nSome more context on this change is: today Druid uses indexes very aggressively, so string post filtering doesn't happen very often. I think it actually may never happen on QueryableIndex, since between QueryableIndexStorageAdapter (which uses bitmaps for any top-level filters that support them) and OrFilter/AndFilter (which have makeMatcher impls that use bitmaps when possible for subfilters) it looks like it may never get called. So today, I think this change really just affects IncrementalIndex filtering.\r\n\r\nThe motivation behind this change is to open up future optimizations like:\r\n\r\n- Combined with the feature in #5402, make it more feasible to load big unique string values (like free form text) without wasting space and also wasting time on eager filtering when those columns are filtered on (it is very likely they will end up in the \"good\" case)\r\n- I want to explore optimizations that involve not always blindly using indexes. Consider a filter like `WHERE col1 = '123' AND col2 LIKE '%foo%'` where col1 and col2 both have bitmap indexes. If the filter `col1 = '123'` is very selective then the query will likely be faster if we _avoid_ using the index for `col2 LIKE '%foo%'` (saving the work needed to examine every value and union a bunch of bitmaps) and instead run it as a ValueMatcher based filter.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/367439260/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/367447879","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/5402#issuecomment-367447879","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/5402","id":367447879,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NzQ0Nzg3OQ==","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-21T19:46:38Z","updated_at":"2018-02-21T19:46:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM

to know how which mode to run in).

This option is on by default starting from [Kafka 0.9.1](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#upgrade_901_notable) `log.cleanup.policy=compact`. To close this issue, if needed we can update the docs to make sure Druid users know about the issue and the flag. Also IMO we can remove the warning log msg I don't think it really helps, if the user is asking to allow gaps he doesn't need a warning about that. @pjain1  and @gianm  what you think?

am not sure how much you are familiar with dependency injection used by Druid. One way to do this is to add boolean config variable maybe call it `useNativeIO` perhaps you can shoved it in `io.druid.query.DruidProcessingConfig`, then you would have to get an instance of the `DruidProcessingConfig` and using that flag you add an if true/false useNative/useOldCode.
