In terms of convergence behavior, it has both benefit of mini-batch that iterates fast and large batch size that reduce the variance of the empirical objective. To see this, note that we do multiple epoch within each buffer and given enough epoch we solve that buffer accurately, which can in turn be seen as applying multiple update towards the minimizer of objective formulated from that buffer. That is the reason why we only need one evoke of UDA and it gives us pretty good solution already. I encourage you to test yourself. I will also run more experiments in the future.\n\nRegarding the gradient, I think in this case it is not a very good convergence indicator since hinge loss is not a smooth function, e.g., such that when the loss does not change much the gradient is still far from zero.  And one might have overfitting issue if one really force the gradient to be very small. So in this case loss value might be a better indicator of good solution (not necessarily the optimal solution but one with small generalization error). \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/issues/comments/260514142/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/issues/comments/260515126","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/madlib/pull/75#issuecomment-260515126","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/issues/75","id":260515126,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MDUxNTEyNg==","user":{"login":"haying","id":970555,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDU1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/970555?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haying","html_url":"https://github.com/haying","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haying/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haying/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haying/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haying/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haying/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haying/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haying/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haying/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haying/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-15T01:05:22Z","updated_at":"2016-11-15T01:05:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi Xiaocheng,\nThanks for the explanation.

@decibel, thanks for your comments. I removed the regex entirely and replaced it with a built-in madlib function. I addressed your other comments as well. Please let me know what you think.
