, the reason I prefer this approach is that:\r\n\r\n- From the comment in RocksDB's source we can find that deleteRange() should be used for deleting big range, what if the entries num of the map is not that big.\r\n\r\n- From the comments we can also find that deleteRange() would hurt the read performance, so we should consider to set ReadOptions::ignore_range_deletions = true to avoid the negative effect by deleteRange(), but if we use it for MapState.clear(), it seems that we can't set ReadOptions::ignore_range_deletions = true.\r\n\r\nAnd current approach should not bring any

It seems like this current version does not include integrating timers with the other keyed state? I am asking because my plan would be to integrate timers more deeply with the keyed backends so that we can also use asynchronous and incremental snapshots. One of your previous comments mentioned something in this direction as well and I wanted to ask what your plans about that are? Otherwise,  I would take over and probably cherrypick some parts like the rocks timer heap from this PR and integrate them with the keyed backends myself so that those features can also be supported by making timers part of the backends checkpoint data.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/389925240/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/389931879","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6038#issuecomment-389931879","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6038","id":389931879,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4OTkzMTg3OQ==","user":{"login":"tzulitai","id":5284370,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODQzNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5284370?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai","html_url":"https://github.com/tzulitai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-17T16:41:34Z","updated_at":"2018-05-17T16:41:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"r: @StefanRRichter ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/389931879/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/389939141","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6040#issuecomment-389939141","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6040","id":389939141,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4OTkzOTE0MQ==","user":{"login":"tzulitai","id":5284370,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODQzNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5284370?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai","html_url":"https://github.com/tzulitai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-17T17:05:35Z","updated_at":"2018-05-17T17:05:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the PR @snuyanzin!\r\nI had some comments, please let me know what you think.\r\n\r\nAlso, some general contribution tips:\r\n1.

we had some offline discussion on how to proceed with this.\r\n@aljoscha, @twalthr, or @StephanEwen can probably comment more here if I missed anything.\r\n\r\nThe conflict that Stephan mentioned between a \"common deserialization schema\" interface and exposing surfacing connector specific information is rooted in the fact that both concerns (deserialization and providing connector specific record meta information) is currently coupled in a single interface.\r\n\r\nTake for example the Kafka connector's `KeyedDeserializationSchema` - there we try to deserialize the Kafka bytes, as well as provide information such as topic / partition / timestamp etc. to allow the user to enrich their user records for downstream business logic. The first part (deserialization of bytes) should be something common for all connector sources, while the second part is Kafka-specific.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we should perhaps break this up into two separate interfaces, as follows:\r\n```\r\n// common interface for all sources (we already have this)\r\ninterface DeserializationSchema<T> {\r\n    T deserialize(byte[] bytes);\r\n}\r\n\r\n// ... and a Kafka-specific interface that is only used to provide record meta information\r\ninterface ConsumerRecordMetaInfoProvider<T> {\r\n    T enrich(T record, ConsumerRecordMetaInfo metaInfo);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe second interface is something that each connector should have independently, and does not handle deserialization of the record bytes. The name, of course, is still open to discussion.\r\nUsers should then be flexible, for example, in just providing a `AvroDeserializationSchema` provided by Flink to consumer from Kafka with Avro, and have the record enrichment of Kafka-specific information un-touched.\r\n\r\nThe whole story would then be we deprecate the Kafka-specfic `KeyedDeserializationSchema` in favor of this new design.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/390178815/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/390211740","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/5863#issuecomment-390211740","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/5863","id":390211740,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MDIxMTc0MA==","user":{"login":"walterddr","id":3581352,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1ODEzNTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3581352?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr","html_url":"https://github.com/walterddr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-18T13:44:48Z","updated_at":"2018-05-18T13:44:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @tzulitai for the review.
