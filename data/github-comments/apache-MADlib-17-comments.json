After a certain point, the overhead starts to be more significant.\r\nIf you have a large number of groups with small chunks of data, it might be helpful to slightly increase this number (and vice versa). However, this is not a definitive rule.

changes LGTM. I had one concern, it's more of a trade-off though.\r\nI think the main intent of this PR is to make the tests manageable, and this PR surely does that well. But the total time to run the same tests now increases significantly:\r\nTime to run all the tests together in master:\r\n```\r\nTEST CASE RESULT|Module: deep_learning|madlib_keras.sql_in|PASS|Time: 35243 milliseconds\r\n```\r\nTime to run the same tests now split across 4 files in this PR branch:\r\n```\r\nTEST CASE RESULT|Module: deep_learning|madlib_keras_evaluate.sql_in|PASS|Time: 6623 milliseconds\r\nTEST CASE RESULT|Module: deep_learning|madlib_keras_fit.sql_in|PASS|Time: 22986 milliseconds\r\nTEST CASE RESULT|Module: deep_learning|madlib_keras_predict.sql_in|PASS|Time: 17447 milliseconds\r\nTEST CASE RESULT|Module: deep_learning|madlib_keras_transfer_learning.sql_in|PASS|Time: 8327 milliseconds\r\n```\r\nIt is ~55 seconds now against ~35 seconds on master.
