Furthermore it sucks that LBSolrClient mutates this path during processing.  I would prefer to see it removed, and instead only HttpSolrClient should support a special request method overloaded that accepts a URL to the node to where the request should be sent.  LBSolrClient would use this method instead of mutating setBasePath, and furthermore all the other callers of setBasePath out there would instead use this pattern.  I just scanned over all of them outside tests and nearly every one submits the request with a client immediately following calling setBasePath.  Again, this suggests that Http2SolrClient should have such an overload.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2075826049/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2076445977","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2197#issuecomment-2076445977","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2197","id":2076445977,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM57xA0Z","user":{"login":"renatoh","id":10344132,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzQ0MTMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10344132?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/renatoh","html_url":"https://github.com/renatoh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renatoh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renatoh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renatoh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renatoh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renatoh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renatoh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renatoh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renatoh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renatoh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-25T06:15:16Z","updated_at":"2024-04-25T06:15:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@dsmiley Thanks for picking this up!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2076445977/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2077004881","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2414#issuecomment-2077004881","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2414","id":2077004881,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM57zJRR","user":{"login":"gerlowskija","id":9030708,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMzA3MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9030708?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija","html_url":"https://github.com/gerlowskija","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-25T11:53:53Z","updated_at":"2024-04-25T11:55:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I forgot to share I have the same concern.

As a next step I might go learn more about the `Presearcher` itself.\r\n\r\nI'll give the PR a look but on an architectural level it is similar from what you describe. The custom update processor adds the saved search to some stateful component. The reverse search component takes a solr doc and converts it to a lucene query. It then runs that document-in-query-form against the stateful component to find the matching saved searches. And when I first looked at this I wanted to use the monitor as the stateful component. But quickly some problems emerged with that idea. My main concerns wiring a Monitor straight into solr were:\r\n\r\n1. Handling commit/rollback and what to update the tlog with if you also writing to a \"sidecar\" monitor object?\r\n2. Handling persistence. Currently the Monitor has its own tightly sealed index. It can be configured for persistence but if you want to peek at the segments a monitor is writing to disk it might not be easy, especially to handle configurations like tlog+pull. The alternative is to use only the in-memory Monitor configurations but that has limitations and takes away precious resources from the {cacheId -> deserialized query} cache.\r\n3. Bringing me to my final point that the cache a Monitor object wraps is a simple ConcurrentHashMap and the Monitor itself is updated with a very coarse-grained lock that can block reads for  a long time (because it synchronizes the map with the index). It just doesn't feel like it \"jives\" with the solr approach to concurrency that is much more sophisticated (it is a fully fledged db after all). We could make the Monitor cache more configurable in the upstream lucene monitor repo but in my opinion lucene monitor tries to do too much state-management that its not that good at but the most valuable thing to take advantage of is the sophisticated reverse search methods (query decomposition for faster matching, query tokenization for pre-search, term weighting, optimized document-to-query conversion with term-acceptor, and probably something else I am forgetting).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2078142747/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2080157816","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2424#issuecomment-2080157816","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2424","id":2080157816,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM57_LB4","user":{"login":"dsmiley","id":377295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzI5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/377295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley","html_url":"https://github.com/dsmiley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-26T21:44:15Z","updated_at":"2024-04-26T21:44:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Unlike a Git log, CHANGES.txt has cleaner data and can be edited if we see a formatting or spelling glitch.

I'll open a separate ticket for the security.json refactor and tag Eric.\r\n\r\nThere is a minor followup I would like to add to this PR. `EmbeddedSolrServer.request()` has _two_ places where `_parser.buildRequestFrom()` is called. One codepath is when the request handler can be found on the CoreContainer, and the other codepath is when the request handler has to be retrieved from the SolrCore itself. This PR so far only updated the second codepath because that's the path that's active in the subquery execution scenario. To be consistent though, I'm thinking the first codepath should be updated as well. It's a one-line change just to add the Principal to a _parser.buildRequestFrom() call. I'm planning to submit to this same branch shortly. Since existing unit tests don't seem to care about this, I'd be interested in any advice on if & how we should add coverage for it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2082885569/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2082948170","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2404#issuecomment-2082948170","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2404","id":2082948170,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM58J0RK","user":{"login":"epugh","id":22395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh","html_url":"https://github.com/epugh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-29T14:48:57Z","updated_at":"2024-04-29T14:48:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think open a seperate PR, just to keep the one that was merged and committed seperate from a new one.

opened a separate PR here: https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2429\r\nBasically, it's a one-line change that updates another `_parser.buildRequestFrom()` call inside `EmbeddedSolrServer.request()`.

In earlier discussion we had here, folks asked if there were other cases we might be missing where a Principal is lost, so I did some more looking around. This is the other such case that I've come across so far. I added some more description on the new PR.

I used a relatively high field limit, 1000, but we can raise it if folks think 1000 is too low?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2086978057/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2087740588","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1654#issuecomment-2087740588","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1654","id":2087740588,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM58cGSs","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-01T00:00:28Z","updated_at":"2024-05-01T00:00:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This PR had no visible activity in the past 60 days, labeling it as stale.

Ease of configuration might be a reason? Or could one imagine a scenario where indexing and searching wish to use different presearcher types or settings?\r\n\r\nAnd then next I looked to understand more on how the `ReverseQueryParser[Plugin]` and `SimpleQueryParser` objects fit into the picture. Here I was temporarily a little confused, the `ReverseQueryParser` seems to do little parsing but more post-processing on the json-to-document parsing done by `ReverseSearchComponent.documentBatch` previously and `SimpleQueryParser` seems to wrap the default parser. Okay, but leaving that side-thought aside, back to the `Presearcher` focus of my session -- if there wasn't the `ReverseQueryParser[Plugin]` objects then what might own the `Presearcher` object? Both `MonitorUpdateRequestProcessor` and `ReverseSearchComponent` need to be configured by neither seems an obvious owner for a presearcher used by both.\r\n\r\nSo next then considering the `ReverseSearchComponent` more closely:\r\n* `ReverseSearchComponent.process` jumps out as being a no-op.\r\n* Upon further consideration this appears to be because use-together-with the `QueryComponent` is assumed, is that correct?\r\n* If the `ReverseSearchComponent` must be used together with the `QueryComponent` then wondering what's the pros/cons of that versus `ReverseSearchComponent extends QueryComponent` inheritance instead.\r\n\r\nAnd if the `ReverseSearchComponent` itself and use of it must be configured e.g. `<arr name=\"last-components\"> <str>reverseSearch</str> </arr>` in the request handler, then might an alternative be to have a reverse search handler class (with in-built default components) and with ownership of the presearcher? \r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class ReverseSearchHandler extends SearchHandler {\r\n\r\n  private Presearcher presearcher;\r\n\r\n  @Override\r\n  protected List<String> getDefaultComponents() {\r\n    ArrayList<String> names = new ArrayList<>(2);\r\n    names.add(QueryComponent.COMPONENT_NAME);\r\n    names.add(ReverseSearchComponent.COMPONENT_NAME);\r\n    return names;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @Override\r\n  @SuppressWarnings(\"unchecked\")\r\n  public void inform(SolrCore core) {\r\n    presearcher = ...\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll just some thinking-aloud type notes here really, as a next step I'll probably look further at the `ReverseQueryParser[Plugin]` and `SimpleQueryParser` classes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2088667529/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2088871902","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2417#issuecomment-2088871902","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2417","id":2088871902,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM58gafe","user":{"login":"laminelam","id":104593675,"node_id":"U_kgDOBjv5Cw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104593675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/laminelam","html_url":"https://github.com/laminelam","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laminelam/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laminelam/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laminelam/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laminelam/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laminelam/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laminelam/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laminelam/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laminelam/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laminelam/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-01T18:16:20Z","updated_at":"2024-05-01T18:16:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @laminelam I'm following up my response last night.

Or could one imagine a scenario where indexing and searching wish to use different presearcher types or settings?\r\n\r\nI think it would be difficult to support defined behavior if a different presearcher configuration was used for indexing vs search. I am sure there is some scenario where this is useful but I think it is tricky to implement. Moreover, lucene's `Monitor` shares the [same presearcher instance](https://github.com/apache/lucene/blob/main/lucene/monitor/src/java/org/apache/lucene/monitor/Monitor.java#L46C31-L46C42) for both sides of its API.\r\n\r\n> Here I was temporarily a little confused, the ReverseQueryParser seems to do little parsing but more post-processing on the json-to-document parsing done by ReverseSearchComponent.documentBatch previously .. \r\n\r\nI am confused too! I didn't pay a lot of attention to this but I'll try to see if I can remove these two bits and just stick the logic in the `ReverseSearchComponent`. I'll reply otherwise if I can think of any good reason for this superfluous separation of duties that really seem very related.\r\n\r\n> ReverseSearchComponent extends QueryComponent inheritance instead.\r\n\r\nI think I like this idea a lot and am willing to try it out unless you beat me to it! I must say I also very much like the neatly-packaged `ReverseSearchHandler` idea which is actually well-defined in code and reduces the need for boilerplate config of potential users. \r\n\r\n> SimpleQueryParser seems to wrap the default parser.\r\n\r\nYes it's mainly there to be a `SolrQueryRequest` which the parser needs to satisfy its contract. I know its a hack so I'm open to a better idea of wrapping this like maybe making the `SimpleQueryRequest` an inner class? The benefit of this parser wrapper is that you avoid creating this \"dummy\" solr request in the two places that currently call it. Tangentially, I'd like to also support additional query parameters on top of the query string, i.e. the `df` default field param, but I haven't gotten to that yet (you'll notice that `SimpleQueryParser::getParams` method is empty for now). Basically, there could be a scenario where the `SimpleQueryParser::parse(String, SolrCore, SolrParams)` might drift further from `QParser.getParser(String, SolrQueryRequest)`. `SimpleQueryParser` is probably a terrible name btw.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2089353858/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2090355350","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2417#issuecomment-2090355350","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2417","id":2090355350,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM58mEqW","user":{"login":"epugh","id":22395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh","html_url":"https://github.com/epugh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-02T12:16:45Z","updated_at":"2024-05-02T12:16:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@laminelam  I just merged in the latest, notice the compressor stuff for `ZkCpTool`?
