@pratyakshsharma : Can we do two kinds of de-duplicate together? First, de-duplicate by different commits, then de-duplicate same commit, they are not incompatible, we can remove all the duplicate data at once.\r\n\r\nYes it is possible to do both types of deduplicate together. But I feel in most of the cases, only one of the 2 possible cases (de-duplicate by different commits or de-duplicate same commit) would be needed for doing deduping. In essence, that would mean one of the 2 flows would be running unnecessarily. That was the sole reason I introduced the boolean useCommitTimeForDedupe.\r\nSo I prefer to have the code flow in its current form. If you strongly feel, I would do the changes that you are suggesting. Please let me know your thoughts on this. :)

One of the primary contract within Hudi is the uniqueness of record key within partition/dataset. Instead, can you materialize the grouping within the record. To elaborate, can you create a nested array of struct field : \"audit_log\" (inner struct having same structure as top-level struct without audit_log) in your schema which would contain basically the list of record images at each ingest time and have your custom payload append all previous images as part of combineAndGetUpdateValue and preCombine. This way if you want the latest image, you simply have to skip projecting \"audit_log\" in your query and don't have to deal with reduce-by.

Unfortunately there is no such switch to skip null values on upsert as of now. You can either try to populate default values for fields with null values or try to do some workarounds using transformers (but I feel that will not be a good way :( ). \r\n\r\nAnother way to handle this can be comparing old and new parquet files after every hudi commit, and try to do one round of clean up to suit your use case. But this would need dev cycles from your side.
