Sorry for the delay. I am stuck about and also fearing this overflow things. There are not simple bugs, there are limitations. Hard to fix, only fragile workaround for best wish. I have some chaos thoughts for this issue:\r\n1. Curator guarantees no ordering-ness about  `VersionedValue.getVersion`. That is good. Better to document this out of order issue or make it private in future.\r\n2. The promise about \"up-to-date\" should be guaranteed.\r\n3. Silent \"never update\" is not good which is the goal for us to fix here.\r\n\r\nI am ok to a workaround but I am also think exception(e.g. let caller know they hit an implementation limitation) is a good fallback except for background watcher. Though, I am not positive to a good workaround. I think there are few choices when encountering this hard limitation.\r\n1. Push foward underlying implementation. In this case, a `check_zxid` version of `setData` in ZooKeeper.\r\n2. Rewrites something in caller side. In this case, either curator side or your application.\r\n3. Workaround possibly fragile.\r\n\r\nAll these suggestions happened in https://lists.apache.org/thread/4o3rl49rdj5y0134df922zgc8clyt86s.  cc @li4wang \r\n\r\nBesides above, did you find this in production ?

Thanks for your detailed comments. I totally agree that this issue is not very easy/simple to fix perfectly. But for my case, this improvement could fix it when try to reproduce.\r\n\r\n> Besides above, did you find this in production ? What is your use case ?\r\n\r\nOf course YES. The corresponding code snippet as following shows.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/a6c2526c6c7ccfc4483f58695aedf0cb892b4c4d/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/security/token/delegation/ZKDelegationTokenSecretManager.java#L506-L516\r\n\r\nI would like to give a brief explanation (which is dependent by Hadoop project).\r\nA. For HDFS RBF architecture[1], all Routers share the same states which is managed by zookeeper, and Token is one of these states.\r\nB. About token[2], one Router generate token using increment sequence number shared by all Routers and update corresponding znode value (/zkdtsm/ZKDTSMRoot/ZKDTSMSeqNumRoot), let's name it Z.\r\nC. Where token number will be million/day or more, and the version of znode Z will overflow only years after create(maybe less than three years if 5 million/day tokens generated.)\r\n\r\nAt first, I want to fix it at Hadoop side, but it is not smoothy and could not fix the root cause.\r\n\r\nFor this PR, my first thought is fix at curator side first, then try to improve it at both zookeeper and curator side as the solution you mentioned above. Any thoughts?

The default `batchSize` is small.

When `previous.getVersion` reach to `-1`, `trySetCount` has few choices:\r\n1. Exception to caller for limitation of the implementation, that is `Stat.version` overflowed and wraparound to `-1` and [`setData` with `-1` `version`](https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/b31f776471fef79ab161f416d58367bdffaf37a9/zookeeper-server/src/main/java/org/apache/zookeeper/ZooKeeper.java#L2187) is a blind update.\r\n2. Keep silent and do a blind update.\r\n\r\nThe later behavior is a bug due to the contract what `trySetCount` try to express. As a library, I don't think Curator should do that for callers silently.\r\n\r\nFor the \"no\" part, callers can risk themselves by doing a blind update through `setCount`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/1717815870/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/1718708611","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/curator/pull/478#issuecomment-1718708611","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/478","id":1718708611,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQjg0c5mcWmD","user":{"login":"Hexiaoqiao","id":1393756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTM3NTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1393756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hexiaoqiao","html_url":"https://github.com/Hexiaoqiao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hexiaoqiao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hexiaoqiao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hexiaoqiao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hexiaoqiao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hexiaoqiao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hexiaoqiao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hexiaoqiao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hexiaoqiao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hexiaoqiao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-14T03:27:03Z","updated_at":"2023-09-14T03:27:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> The later behavior is a bug due to the contract what trySetCount try to express.

IMO, some sensitive data should not be updated blindly, but some case we should offer solution to bypass this bug, such as `Token for Hadoop` as mentioned above, which can update smoothly even blindly.

Clients can bypass themselves easily on exception if they encounter or aware of this.

Glad to see you here.\r\n\r\n> While it can be better for ZK to jump from version -2 to 0 so that in an overflow loop we don't handle -1 hole, the restart and get versioned value = -1 remains and set data concurrently doesn't hurt as long as we read the updated data finally.\r\n\r\nIt will be more smooth while ZK to skip version -1, Strong +1. From my first thought, it would be the next step after we fix at Curator side.
