Should we add this to the Key groups design doc or there is going to be a bigger one more general about different system aspects of the dynamic scaling?\n\nIt might make sense to introduce some sort of a scheduling hint for when we redeploy a job with higher parallelism so that we can exploit some state checkpoint locality for quicker recovery, but this is another topic.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/230743974/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/230749073","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1813#issuecomment-230749073","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1813","id":230749073,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMDc0OTA3Mw==","user":{"login":"mjsax","id":8959638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NTk2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8959638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax","html_url":"https://github.com/mjsax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-06T11:43:53Z","updated_at":"2016-07-06T11:43:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@rmetzger

specify to YARN vs the memory the JVM is actually using.\nSo if we specify a container of 1000 MB, it will be killed by YARN as soon as we use 1001 MBs. For operating systems, this doesn't apply and if users run into issues, the can just set a lower heap size.\nFor Mesos, I don't know how it behaves, but I hope that there is a similar requirement, otherwise, we would have prematurely optimized the configuration keys.\nI'm against applying this mechanism to all JVMs we start.\n\nFor the environment variables of the standalone mode, its quite easy to put the environment variables into the config.sh file, or just set the env variables.\nBut true, we could do a follow up JIRA to extract those env variables and set them in the config.sh script.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/231081121/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/231083388","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1555#issuecomment-231083388","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1555","id":231083388,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMTA4MzM4OA==","user":{"login":"rmetzger","id":89049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger","html_url":"https://github.com/rmetzger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-07T13:51:24Z","updated_at":"2016-07-07T13:51:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing this PR.

It is a specific implementation that uses pattern matching. This can be provided by the programmer. Given this, in the FileInputFormat, the filesFilter (which we could change the name to filePathFilter or sth more expressive of its function) becomes a FilePathFilter.\n\n2) Given that the filter is now in the FileInputFormat, then the ContinuousFileMonitoringFunction should change, as now it is the format that does the filtering. So the filter should be removed from its constructor and the shouldIgnore() method becomes redundant.\n\n3) The affected methods in the StreamExecutionEnvironment should change too.\n\nIt could help if you shared a design draft before integrating the changes, so that we can discuss on them and figure out all the parts in the code that change and need testing.\n\nWhat do you think?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/231374583/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/231378613","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2109#issuecomment-231378613","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2109","id":231378613,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMTM3ODYxMw==","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-08T14:44:33Z","updated_at":"2016-07-08T14:44:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"1.

The deserializer is responsible for detecting the end of the record and we wouldn't need to change the pointer value when replacing with a smaller record.\n\nA problem would arise in `EntryIterator`: after reading a record, we wouldn't know where the next record starts.

Currently the Kinesis consumer requires the user to specify `CONFIG_AWS_REGION` as a must.\n   I wonder if we need to check for conflicting `CONFIG_AWS_REGION` and `CONFIG_AWS_ENDPOINT` values, i.e.region is set to \"us-east-1\", but endpoint is set to \"ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com\", if the user happens to set endpoint even if they are not testing?\n2. Also, would it be strange to require a `CONFIG_AWS_REGION`, but will still be overridden with the ip of the local Kinesalite when testing? I don't have experience of using Kinesalite, so I wonder how users take this.\n\nWhat do you think?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/231966870/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
