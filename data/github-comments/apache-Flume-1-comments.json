Kudu is still in beta with new APIs and capabilities being added reasonably rapidly. Versioning the flume sink inside the Kudu repo will make it easier to (a) ensure that Kudu changes don't break the flume sink, and (b) quickly evolve the Flume sink to take advantage of those new features.\n- Currently, the Kudu project doesn't export any \"minicluster\" JAR for use by external projects. So, it will be impossible to do any integration testing of the Kudu sink if it's part of the Flume project. On the other hand, if we include it in the Kudu repo, we already have build/test infrastructure that runs a local minicluster and we could easily write some simple integration tests.\n\nAny thoughts on this?

Maybe add a comment about this for people new to Travis?\n\n> I think, if we have MAVEN_OPTS = \"...\" mvn, then we need to have MAVEN_SKIP_RC = 1.\n\nWhy?

Would we ever do that?\n\nPersonally I like to avoid putting stuff in default locations for build scripts in order to avoid unintended side effects either in other concurrent builds or in future builds. I just don't like to \"pollute\" the environment. However, I'm guessing Travis uses a Docker image or something like that and wipes out the home dir before each build so you can leave cruft in $HOME and it will never affect future builds. Is that right?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/issues/comments/255621437/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
