To make it work, we might have to divide CREATE VIEW text into 2 parts, 1 for sql text, 1 for the rest.\r\n\r\nHowever, since CREATE VIEW syntax is fairly stable for years, field `sql` and optional `field-*` should be enough to re-create the CREATE VIEW statement in different engines.

You're right about the spec mandating that delete entries must be sorted by `file_path` and `file_pos`. That's what we are doing on the Hive side as well, but came across the problem that since data files can be added via the API with any arbitrary name, an alphabetical sort of the `file_paths` could still lead to out of order partition values. \r\n\r\nAs for the `spec_id` and `partition` columns, to be honest I kinda missed that they have been added to the `MetadataColumns` :) I haven't tried them out yet, but I'm assuming you could include them too in the sort (e.g. `sort by spec_id, partition, file_path, file_pos`) and have your data perfectly clustered with their help.\r\n\r\nI think there might still be some utility in keeping this writer implementation as well for the problems similar to the one described above, but I'll leave it up to you.
