Is it necessary for us to keep all the ApiTestCase consistent(Replace to MockitoJUnitRunner or SpringRunner)?\r\n\r\n非常感谢你的回答。\r\n但是我想了解的是之前是有什么场景需要我们把`ProcessDefinitionControllerTest` 的测试组件从`SpringRunner` 换为`MockitoJUnitRunner` 吗？\r\n我们是否有必要将api层所有的测试框架统一(全部换为MockitoJUnitRunner或者SpringRunner)？","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/650669527/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/650670691","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/pull/3057#issuecomment-650670691","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/3057","id":650670691,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1MDY3MDY5MQ==","user":{"login":"sonarqubecloud[bot]","id":39514782,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mzk1MTQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/12526?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/sonarqubecloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-28T02:02:22Z","updated_at":"2020-06-28T02:02:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Kudos,

I think it's not appropriate to adapted when the read the unknown enum value and return null because it will swallow all the enum deserialization error by using `JSONUtils` and cause some unforeseen errors;\r\n2. And in general, this kind of data error due to the front-end transmission should be fail fast, and not suitable for subsequent adaptation;\r\nCan you help to fix this in the transmission part of the front-end ?\r\n\r\n我也检查了一遍，确实是fastjson在反序列化时做了适配。\r\n个人理解，\r\n1. 这样的适配的应该是没有必要的，因为这样的适配会导致所有用到`JSONUtils`的枚举值序列化错误都会被吞掉，可能会导致一些不可预见的错误；\r\n2. 一般情况下这类由于前端传输的数据错误应该都是fail-fast的，而不适合后续去做适配；\r\n你可以从前端传输数据的角度去修复这个问题，把这种情况避免吗？","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/651539819/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/651555913","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/pull/3068#issuecomment-651555913","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/3068","id":651555913,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1MTU1NTkxMw==","user":{"login":"break60","id":28628088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NjI4MDg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28628088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/break60","html_url":"https://github.com/break60","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/break60/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/break60/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/break60/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/break60/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/break60/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/break60/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/break60/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/break60/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/break60/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-30T05:48:28Z","updated_at":"2020-06-30T05:48:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"very
