I prefer option 1.\r\n\r\n@FrozenGene Thank you for the clue! However, I haven't find how to restrict the dtype attributes in `Conv2DRel` or `Conv2DAttrs`... Should I add the type restriction to the `UniformAttrs`, or raise error in the `MakeUniform` and `UniformRel`?\r\n\r\n> How well does this approach work when we have a large range (high - low)? It seems like we would be loosing a lot of potential randomness.\r\n\r\n@tkonolige As this approach is only using the fraction bits to represent float, there will be loss of randomness for all floats, at least `(2^nexp-1) / 2^nexp` of the float (nexp stands for the number of exponential digits). However, it's a little tricky to use all 64 digits of the random bit to represent a uniform distributed float number... Do you have any idea on that?\r\n\r\n> Perhaps this is the operation you're looking for? https://github.com/altanh/tvm/blob/2d9ac7710ab055d4f20e8b5a0a3580836723efac/python/tvm/topi/generic/algorithm.py#L465\r\n\r\n@altanh Thank you for your references!

how to disable it for the MPS2 board only, since CONFIG_FPU=y will be enabled by default anyway for all the boards, and apparently  CONFIG_FPU=n is not enough to disable (override) it per

I'm not sure.\r\n> \r\n> Thanks for the work!\r\n\r\nHi @altanh, thanks a lot for reviewing along with these great questions. 👍 \r\n\r\n**Q. What happens when PassContexts are nested? I'm not sure if this is allowed today but it feels to me like they could compose.**\r\n\r\nA. Yes, PassContext can be nested. Instrument will be active in the same level (in the view of PassContext).\r\n``` python\r\ndef test_print():\r\n    x, y, z = [tvm.relay.var(c, shape=(3, 4), dtype=\"float32\") for c in \"xyz\"]\r\n    e1 = op.add(x, y)\r\n    e2 = op.subtract(x, z)\r\n    e3 = op.multiply(e1, e1 / e2)\r\n    mod = tvm.IRModule.from_expr(e3 + e2)\r\n\r\n    @tvm.instrument.pass_instrument\r\n    class NamePrinter:\r\n      def run_before_pass(self, mod, pass_info):\r\n        print(pass_info.name)\r\n        return True\r\n\r\n    print_name = NamePrinter()\r\n    with tvm.transform.PassContext(instruments=[print_name]):\r\n        mod = tvm.relay.transform.AnnotateSpans()(mod)\r\n        with tvm.transform.PassContext():\r\n          mod = tvm.relay.transform.ToANormalForm()(mod)\r\n          mod = tvm.relay.transform.InferType()(mod)\r\n\r\ntest_print()\r\n\r\n# output:\r\n# AnnotateSpans   \r\n# InferType             # Note: InferType is a nested pass, same pass ctx with AnnotateSpans. Still instrumented, since finally it goes through ModulePassNode::operator().\r\n#  \r\n# Inner level passes are not printed, since no instruments provided. \r\n```\r\n\r\nIf users want to render nested passes like you did in pass timing, currently I don't have a good idea and I am not sure will it be common usage. The rendering effort currently is left to user.\r\n\r\nDo you have any suggestions and more use scenarios (beside time)?\r\n\r\n\r\n**Q. The `disabled_pass` option feels redundant now for PassContext, perhaps we should keep it for backwards compatibility but it could be easily replaced using a `DisableByName` instrument (or something like that).**\r\n\r\nA. Yes, I agree. I left it here. Maybe use another PRs to add/remove these in the future.\r\n\r\n**Q. Is there a reason why we couldn't overload the superclass (`PassNode`) `operator()` for doing the before and after instrumentation? the new changes have some duplicated lines for each type of PassNode.**\r\n\r\nA. Yes, I aware that.\r\nBasically, this PR is just an enhanced \"trace\"  (```with PassContext(treace=xxx)```), I just replace how the trace are implemented.\r\n\r\nFor the reason not to overload superclass, I don't know, but I have a guess, maybe need someone to confirm:\r\nCurrently, only ```FunctionPass, ModulePass, SequentialPass and PrimFuncPass``` extends ```Pass```. \r\n```FunctionPass``` calls  ```InferType``` at the end  (see the comments for detail) while ```SequentialPass``` is just like a wrapper.\r\n\r\nIn these cases, ```InterType``` and ```SequentialPass``` maybe not want to be traced/instrumented.\r\n\r\n**Q. Since passes can be called without a PassContext, it might be possible that there is no PassContext- maybe there's a global/thread local one? I'm not sure.**\r\n\r\nA. I thought about that, but I prefer the old \"trace\" way (No pass context, no trace/instrument).\r\n    If I missed something, please let me know. e.g. There is a way to enable \"trace\" globally.\r\n
