While #2546 has decided most details about the pass manager internals, I would like us to think a bit more about the API design itself.  In particular, how to learn from deep learning frameworks(pytorch, keras, gluon) to build an API that is intuitive, friendly and requires the users to write a minimum amount of code.\r\n\r\nDuring a conversation with @MarisaKirisame and others, we try to mock up what the usage of the code looks like, and we try to model it relatively similar to pytorch (see updated example).\r\n\r\nI think we should iterate on the API designs. At the current moment, we have quite a few boiler-plate in relay.build_module etc. that I hope eventually we can simplify with just the consistent elegant code.\r\n\r\nThe transform namespace arises from the idea to be consistent with MLIR. MLIR tries to separate pass into two categories(transforms: Module->Module, analysis; Module->AnalysisResult). I think it is a good separation that we could learn from. It also avoids the problem of ```pass``` being a keyword in python.\r\n\r\nWe could use ```transform``` namespace as a new namespace to implement such change, we keep the original API, and migrate

@icemelon9 and I have been quietly hacking on a prototype the last few months but have been busy with other things (such as VM 😄 ). We are going to start pushing now, I opened a draft PR which will contain type checking changes, and we will follow-up with code generation next.\r\n\r\nOne thing would be to help validate and criticize the design from the standpoint of a user who is deploying models day to day. We are also generally interested in thoughts about code generation strategies. \r\n\r\nOne change that we have decided on is adding the ability to type hint when generating IR. \r\n\r\nWhen generating IR from frameworks we don't necessarily have all type information up front.\r\nThat is you may know a static shape for a value, but the shape is not necessarily a stable static property. \r\n\r\nFor example imagine a loop variable which starts as a (1, 1) matrix, but will grow by one in the first dimension on every loop. Eventually the matrix will have the shape (n, 1) where `n` is the number of loop iterations but we can't know that statically.\r\n\r\nOur current solution is to generate IR with unknown types, plus a type hint, allowing inference to eventually solve the most general type. \r\n\r\nFor example if we were to generate IR for a loop we can do:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef my_loop(%x: ?T, %y: ?U) {\r\n     ...\r\n     can_unify(%x, shape=(1, 1))\r\n     my_loop(concat([%x, %x], axis=0))\r\n     ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese could later be used to inform code generation, but ensure that we get the correct typing.\r\n \r\nI will also be at the Diff. Prog. Conf hosted by FB if you are around to talk more in person.
