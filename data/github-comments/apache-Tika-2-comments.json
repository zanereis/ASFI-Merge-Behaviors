It now reuses the model by making use of a state variable.\n- The `isAvailable()` function was previously trying to launch an external process for every call to figureout availability of 'lucene-geo-gazeteer' command. This has been changed to use a state variable.\n- The model is loaded on first call to `parse()` or `isAviable()` : via lazy intialization.

Please check my responses below.\n1. I thought we discussed using a table here. Since you have # of rows and # of cols present in the div, why not simply use tables and columns here to represent the OF and OG? (I'll fix this now). \n   ------>\n   In one of the progress reports I think you mentioned we can use \"ol li --- li ol\" sequences instead\n   The OF and HOG are series of 1D vectors instead of series of 2D matrices as I originally thought. \n2. you don't have an ending div on your XHTML (I'll add a fix for this now).\n3. You don't identify in the XHTML what is the OF and what is the OG (I'll fix this now).\n   ------>\n   Sorry about that. I think I missed it\n4. We should probably start out with an h3 of the file name to start out the display.\n   ------>\n   Understood. Will fix it now\n5. I get a whole bunch of NaNs before the XHTML output. Not sure where those are from but they are printed to stdout.\n   ------>\n   Yes. These are the meanChiSquare distance measures of the FeatureVectors. Since, we're running this on a single file, we only have one set of FeatureVectors.\n   When PoT is run on a collection of video files, we extract each video's OF and HOG and then calculate the meanSquareDist across all of them.\n   But this may not be within the scope of a Tika parser. Maybe it should be included in the wrapper program that calls Tika on a set of videos. Much like the implementation of tika-img-similarity github project. Do you think that's right?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/comments/159978831/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/comments/160013294","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tika/pull/64#issuecomment-160013294","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/64","id":160013294,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MDAxMzI5NA==","user":{"login":"chrismattmann","id":395887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NTg4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/395887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrismattmann","html_url":"https://github.com/chrismattmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrismattmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrismattmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrismattmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrismattmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrismattmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrismattmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrismattmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrismattmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrismattmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-27T01:07:29Z","updated_at":"2015-11-27T01:07:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@cafed00d4j i don't get the response to 1.i. - if OF and HOG Are 1D vectors why is there a num rows, num cols?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/comments/160013294/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/comments/160017710","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tika/pull/64#issuecomment-160017710","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/64","id":160017710,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MDAxNzcxMA==","user":{"login":"adhulipa","id":4305228,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDUyMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4305228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adhulipa","html_url":"https://github.com/adhulipa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adhulipa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adhulipa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adhulipa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adhulipa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adhulipa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adhulipa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adhulipa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adhulipa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adhulipa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-27T01:48:13Z","updated_at":"2015-11-27T01:48:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I couldn't think of better terms for them. \n\nThe numRows is number of time-series in the video.

There might be people having projects built on the fact of having the slide notes at the end of the output, and I don't want to break functionality for them. I don't know what the project's stance is on this.\n\nAdditionally (but that's maybe another issue), the PPT output has each slide in a seperate `<div class=\"slide\">` block, while in the PPTX output this isn't the case. This is also something that could be unified, but again, I don't want to break existing behavior.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/comments/173879114/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/comments/174635021","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tika/pull/72#issuecomment-174635021","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/72","id":174635021,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3NDYzNTAyMQ==","user":{"login":"Gagravarr","id":1059677,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTk2Nzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1059677?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gagravarr","html_url":"https://github.com/Gagravarr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gagravarr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gagravarr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gagravarr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gagravarr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gagravarr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gagravarr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gagravarr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gagravarr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gagravarr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-25T19:40:44Z","updated_at":"2016-01-25T19:40:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I don't think that including the text of the notes twice is good from the backwards compatibility standpoint either - it will mess up some people's rendering, along with text frequency stuff.\n\nI think we should decide on the \"right\" set of markup for identifying slides and their associated notes, then fix both PPT and PPTX to follow this + log the change in the changelog to alert existing users.
