Since we expose the use of instanceName to the user in the document, but the user does not know the underlying implementation logic, they will often encounter conflicts.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1010868042/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1010953614","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/3458#issuecomment-1010953614","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/3458","id":1010953614,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl848Qe2O","user":{"login":"Git-Yang","id":30995057,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTk1MDU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30995057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Git-Yang","html_url":"https://github.com/Git-Yang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Git-Yang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Git-Yang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Git-Yang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Git-Yang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Git-Yang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Git-Yang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Git-Yang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Git-Yang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Git-Yang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-12T11:39:46Z","updated_at":"2022-01-12T11:39:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@duhenglucky
