I probably shouldn’t have emphasized this use-case\nas it’s not the main/novel use case.\n\nThe novel use-case is that this operator allows for dynamic behavior at\nDagRun time without overwriting the DAG definition itself (that is, we get\nto keep the history in the UI and have parallel runs each with different\ndefinitions).\n\nI agree that this isn’t a common use case for Airflow, but internally I’ve\nfound it to be a handy way to quickly iterate, develop, and run AWS\nEMR-based workflows that require multiple clusters to execute in sequence.\n\nPlease feel free to close out this PR if it doesn’t belong in\n`apache/airflow`.

together.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/548248142/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/548263114","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6480#issuecomment-548263114","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6480","id":548263114,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0ODI2MzExNA==","user":{"login":"ishan4488","id":8775247,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NzUyNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8775247?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ishan4488","html_url":"https://github.com/ishan4488","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ishan4488/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ishan4488/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ishan4488/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ishan4488/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ishan4488/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ishan4488/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ishan4488/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ishan4488/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ishan4488/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-31T08:27:44Z","updated_at":"2019-10-31T08:27:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"As

**directed** and **acyclic** so we never have to rereun tasks that already completed. But in the real world, some workflows have portions that are cyclic. We sometimes need to revisit tasks that already completed earlier. \r\n\r\nWith `ClearTaskOperator`, we can model such workflows easily without making any changes to the core of Airflow or forcing users to revamp their workflow completely. It is in the same spirit as `ExternalTaskSensor` and `TriggerDagRunOperator` where a task is allowed to examine or control the state of other tasks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/548270725/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/548271480","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6474#issuecomment-548271480","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6474","id":548271480,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0ODI3MTQ4MA==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-31T08:53:59Z","updated_at":"2019-10-31T08:53:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"We have an open discussion in devlist and I think as result the Better place will be providers/amazon/aws .

You are right to point out that there's some inherent problems in the tasks. The underlying problem I often face is that there are some cycles in the tasks that I can't break in the near future, so we  have to go back and rerun tasks that already finished earlier on a regular basis. In the [AIRFLOW-5648](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5648) example, if I need to run tasks `A, C, E, G, H, I, J` one more time after `Sensor` passes, is the best way to do this to copy those tasks into `A1, C1, E1, G1, H1, I1, J1` ? Is there a better alternative provided by Airflow?\r\n\r\n```\r\nA >> C >> E >> G >> H >> I >> J >> K >> L >> M >> Finish\r\n               ^                   ^          \r\n               |                   |__________         \r\nB >> D >> F>>>>                               |\r\n                                              |\r\nSensor >> A1 >> C1 >> E1 >> G1 >> H1 >> I1 >> J1\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/548385907/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/548398662","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6392#issuecomment-548398662","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6392","id":548398662,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0ODM5ODY2Mg==","user":{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-31T14:21:08Z","updated_at":"2019-10-31T14:21:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"You could separate them into 2 DAGs, and use TriggerDagRunOperator after task K in DAG 1 to trigger DAG 2 after sensor passes True.\r\n\r\nYou can have BranchPythonOperator in DAG2: to decide if it needs to just run L & M or run the other branch where 1st task can be TriggerDagRunOperator to run Dag 1.

I'll think a bit more and see if I can adapt the idea for our use. \r\n\r\nSeparating into two DAGs have some other implications for us. E.g. `A, C, E, ..., J` is sometimes not the only chain we need to rerun in the entire workflow (although it is in the simplified example I put up). If every task rerun splits the DAG into two, some of our workflows may end up as four different DAGs because there are two such \"cycles\" in the entire workflow. One use case we often have is someone may need to manually rerun tasks that have finished historically for the past month to pick up changes made to some tasks or to external einvironment. If we separate the workflow on multiple DAGs, that manual rerun becomes harder.\r\n\r\nThat said, the `TriggerDagRunOperator + BranchPythonOperator` idea is definitely something I'll look into a bit more.

My vote would be to change the flag to schedule_at_interval_start and default it to false for now as scheduling_at_interval_start is the more intuitive behavior. What are people's feelings on changing the default execution to schedule interval start and communicating this to existing users in the Updating notes so that they can preserve the old behavior? Could potentially cause headaches for users who don't read the notes but I think it might make sense to bite the bullet at some point for more intuitive behavior overall for new users.\r\n> \r\n> It might be more intuitive to new users but this would mean that every single dag in existence right now would need to be updated, so it's a very disrputive change.\r\n\r\n@ashb To clarify, the idea here is to set a cluster-level default in the airflow.cfg to use the new semantics (execution date = start date), then anyone who owns an Airflow cluster with many customers can just make sure to change the default value back to the old semantics when we change the cluster-level default; no dags would need to be updated on such clusters. Anybody setting up Airflow for the first time would have sensical semantics, and maybe we can even deprecate the old semantics after some point in time since I don't think many new users will use it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/548526225/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/548557567","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6281#issuecomment-548557567","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6281","id":548557567,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0ODU1NzU2Nw==","user":{"login":"yegeniy","id":292802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MjgwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/292802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yegeniy","html_url":"https://github.com/yegeniy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yegeniy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yegeniy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yegeniy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yegeniy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yegeniy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yegeniy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yegeniy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yegeniy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yegeniy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-31T20:34:55Z","updated_at":"2019-10-31T20:34:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yeah, this definitely does a lot more than existing EMR operators.

But note that this can end up in an always True loops so make sure that your BranchPythonOperator in Dag 2 has the correct logic.\r\n\r\nHi, @kaxil , instead of `TriggerDagRunOperator`, what do you think about extracting the sub dag `A, C, E, ..., J` and putting them into a `SubDagOperator`? I.e like this:\r\n```\r\nA >> C >> E >> G >> H >> I >> J >> K >> L >> M >> Finish\r\n               ^                   ^          \r\n               |                   |         \r\nB >> D >> F>>>>                    |\r\n                                   |\r\nSensor >> SubDag_A_to_J >>>>>>>>>>>\r\n\r\n\r\nwhere SubDag_A_to_J is a SubDagOperator containing these tasks:\r\nA >> C >> E >> G >> H >> I >> J\r\n```\r\nThe user experience with `SubDagOperator` for this purpose seems great. Users see the rerun abstracted into a node on the main DAG and when they click on the sub dag node it zooms into the sub dag which shows what is being run. And most importantly for us, everything is still tightly linked together on the main DAG. If we need to rerun things historically it works just fine.\r\n\r\nHowever some research shows that the internet suggests not to use `SubDagOperator` because it has some shortcomings, e.g. [this Astronomer page](https://www.astronomer.io/guides/subdags/). The most cited reason is that `SubDagOperator` used to cause deadlock and thus the default executor in Airflow 1.10.* was changed to `SequentialExecutor` which means only one task in the sub dag can run at a time. That is not great. But there are some workaround offered online, such as [this one](https://medium.com/@team_24989/fixing-subdagoperator-deadlock-in-airflow-6c64312ebb10) that uses a dedicated celery queue to fix the deadlock problem and thus can still let the SubDagOperator run tasks in parallel.\r\n\r\nAnd more interestingly, the latest `SubDagOperator` in master branch has been made into a `BaseSensorOperator` in [this change](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5498). The docstr indicates the deadlock issue can be fixed if we set mode to \"reschedule\". It sounds like the performance issue people were complaining about has already been addressed in the latest Airflow although that change was not released in 1.10.6. Is that the case? If that's the case, it sounds like we have to wait a while before we can safely use `SubDagOperator`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nAlthough SubDagOperator can occupy a pool/concurrency slot,\r\nuser can specify the mode=reschedule so that the slot will be\r\nreleased periodically to avoid potential deadlock.\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/549019116/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/549030052","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6467#issuecomment-549030052","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6467","id":549030052,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0OTAzMDA1Mg==","user":{"login":"blcksrx","id":35199552,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MTk5NTUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35199552?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blcksrx","html_url":"https://github.com/blcksrx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blcksrx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blcksrx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blcksrx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blcksrx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blcksrx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blcksrx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blcksrx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blcksrx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blcksrx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-02T10:16:51Z","updated_at":"2019-11-02T10:16:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Actually,
