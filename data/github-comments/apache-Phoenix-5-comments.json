But we're talking about accessing HBase here. I'm not sure if the same holds true. I know there is something similar in the HBase RPC level, but I'd have to find it again in code to double check.\n\n> I am trying to fix the scenario in which multiple threads call loginUserFromKeytab concurrently and then the renewal process no longer works as expected. \n> If only one login happens the renewal works properly.\n\nIs this the same principal over and over again? Are you essentially providing the same principal and keytab in the JDBC URL, expecting Phoenix to do everything for you instead of doing the login in Storm?\n\n> Your concern regarding security is correct.\n\nOk. I would like to redirect your efforts to PHOENIX-3189 then. We cannot sacrifice security for multi-threading (as you can already handle the Kerberos login yourself). Can you take a look at the changes I have staged on #191? If this is the above case I outlined, we can add some concurrency control to prevent concurrent logins from happening.\n\n> you can see that this class is not thread safe and not designed to have different users login in the same JVM as loginUser is defined in this way.\n\nPhoenix itself is not well-designed to support concurrent (different) users accessing HBase because of how UGI works. If your application (Storm) needs to provide this functionality, Storm should perform logins itself, cache the UGI instances, and use {{UGI.doAs(..)}} instead of relying on the static state in UGI.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/243213807/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/243223854","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/phoenix/pull/203#issuecomment-243223854","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/203","id":243223854,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MzIyMzg1NA==","user":{"login":"dbahir","id":11685968,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjg1OTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11685968?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbahir","html_url":"https://github.com/dbahir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbahir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbahir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbahir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbahir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbahir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbahir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbahir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbahir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbahir/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-29T19:09:54Z","updated_at":"2016-08-29T19:09:54Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"HBase

for pursuing this tricky issue, @joshelser.

Did you get to look at the comment regarding the user login ?\n\nAssuming you mean the below..\n\n> With that said I am not sure that you can support multiple users and support renewals with the way the UGI works.\n> If in the same JVM a driver is instantiated for User A and then another driver is instantiated for User B the last call to loginUserFromKeytab will set the the user information in the UGI.\n\nYes, the best way to approach this is that Phoenix's automatic Kerberos login should _only_ be used when there a single user accessing Phoenix at one time. I was thinking that Phoenix could likely use its own docs page on the interactions with Kerberos. That would be a good place to warn people and instruct them how they need to properly support multiple concurrent users on their own.\n\n> Can you allow another to login with a different principal? Would that cause a security issue?\n> If we create one driver(One) with user A and then create another driver(Two) with user B the info in the UGI now is that of user B. So there can be a situation where driver One will be using credentials of user B.\n\nMy thinking is this (but I should probably test it): says userA uses phoenix, then userB starts using Phoenix. This implies that userA would be logged out and I would hope that subsequent interactions with Phoenix by the \"human\" userA would fail because its credentials are no longer there (the RPCs themselves would fail).

There's a fair amount of overhead in what you're doing and Phoenix does not do connection pooling but relies on being able to quickly/cheaply get a connection. Would you have some cycles to investigate that a bit first?\n\nTo my point in the last comment, I believe it's become apparent that people are misusing this functionality. So, I believe there is some education that needs to happen about how clients of Phoenix who need to support multiple Kerberos users concurrently should interact with the system. I think this documentation is point 1. It flat-out shouldn't be used to concurrently support multiple Kerberos users -- developers must write their own code to do this correctly. It's difficult to handle this for them because of the required doAs() call. Can investigate this further too, maybe I'm overlooking something obvious.\n\nI do need to make good on my promise to dig through Hadoop/UGI git-log and try to piece together why exactly UGI isn't doing value-based checks already. This is point 2.\n\nI'd like to move ahead and push then (rather then let it rot on the vine), but will try to address both of these points this week if that's OK with you.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/243655460/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/243879146","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/phoenix/pull/191#issuecomment-243879146","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/191","id":243879146,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0Mzg3OTE0Ng==","user":{"login":"joshelser","id":67863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3ODYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser","html_url":"https://github.com/joshelser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-31T19:48:09Z","updated_at":"2016-08-31T19:48:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> My thinking is this (but I should probably test it): says userA uses phoenix, then userB starts using Phoenix.

Is it possible for you to change the JIRA subject to include PHOENIX-2606 or link somehow, so that we can see the comment logged on JIRA as well.\n\nWith current implementation,  every query is modified to include primary key columns and tries to use RVC, which may produce improper results in following cases and also sometimes there is no advantage in using it as they don’t limit scan.\n- duplicate values for a column\n- order by on non-primary key axis.\n- Primary key columns having null value.\n- Aggregate queries\n\n@samarthjain can you please confirm as per your observation for what all queries RVC cannot be used?\n\n@anirudha \nTo abstract the query complexities and for initial support of Cursors, we should not modify any query but instead we can keep the ResultSet object open for corresponding cursor(with timeout) and start caching rows as we proceed further with next() calls(FETCH NEXT FROM cursor) , the cache will be used for previous() calls(FETCH PRIOR FROM cusror) on resultSet. (cache will also be used for next() calls if we go previous() in the cache).​\n\nPros/Cons of above approach:-\n\nPros:-\n- Highly abstracted, We don’t need to understand each and every query and develop logic separately for them.\n- As per the current implementation, We don’t need to expend ORDER BY(on non-primary key axis) all the time to include primary key column for uniqueness. As this will cause problem at the server because we will have more keys(almost all keys) to sort every time. (RVC will not restrict in this case).\n- Cache size can also be limited by the user and if we exhaust the cache , cache can be updated by using re-runing the query with LIMIT+OFFSET only \n- An optimization can be done for flat queries(including INDEX queries) using last and peeked SCAN keys(instead of RVC to handle null and duplicate properly) for updating the cache instead of LIMIT+OFFSET.\n- Snapshot/Static queries can be provided by storing the compile time of OPEN CURSOR (and can be used to limit the scan upper bound for timestamp with it).\n\nCons:-\n- As previous() is not supported on the server(Hbase), so cache overhead is there to maintain the results to support previous() at client.\n- Re-calculation of results after we reach cache limit or scanner timeout.\n\nHad a discussion with Devaraj on the same and his feedback is incorporated in above comments.\n@JamesRTaylor , WDYT? any suggestions\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/244918530/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/245044098","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/phoenix/pull/200#issuecomment-245044098","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/200","id":245044098,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NTA0NDA5OA==","user":{"login":"twdsilva","id":5653678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTM2Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5653678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twdsilva","html_url":"https://github.com/twdsilva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twdsilva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twdsilva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twdsilva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twdsilva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twdsilva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twdsilva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twdsilva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twdsilva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twdsilva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-06T18:27:46Z","updated_at":"2016-09-06T18:27:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@kliewkliew \n\nThanks for the contribution.

I like your suggestions, @ankitsinghal. The RVC approach will be limited (as Ankit mentioned it will not work in all the cases) and it will be much harder to implement than the approach that Ankit suggested (i.e. just using a ResultSet).\n\nTo simplify things, we can initially not support the previous() operation (I think it's optional anyway). Also, cursors will not see newly inserted inserted data, but I think that's ok in an initial implementation too as you can specify in the metadata that it functions this way. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/246162373/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/246245818","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/phoenix/pull/208#issuecomment-246245818","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/208","id":246245818,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NjI0NTgxOA==","user":{"login":"JamesRTaylor","id":6176299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNzYyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6176299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesRTaylor","html_url":"https://github.com/JamesRTaylor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesRTaylor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesRTaylor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesRTaylor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesRTaylor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesRTaylor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesRTaylor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesRTaylor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesRTaylor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesRTaylor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-12T04:47:02Z","updated_at":"2016-09-12T04:47:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 to the patch.

There are still a number of cases that don't pass. Many of them are due to existing features not being supported, and many are due to other issues within Calcite-Phoenix. I have compiled a list of the major common issues though:\r\n- No differentiation between the regex functions (String based and Byte based)\r\n- Invert and MD5 Function don't work (phoenix doesn't supply the correct arguments in annotation)\r\n- Type matching doesn't work on input arguments (date/timestamp)\r\n- Timezone parameter doesn't work properly in ToDateFunction (basic cases work, but custom timezones do not act as expected)\r\n- Array constructors are not supported (another issue entirely)\r\n\r\n2. I believe you're referring to those in PhoenixScalarFunction, createBuiltinFunctions() and evaluateReturnType()? In the case of createBuiltinFunctions() it makes sense to be in PhoenixScalarFunction since it create instances of that class. We could move evaluateReturnType() to PhoenixSchema since it has more generic behavior, but I'm not entirely convinced that it should move.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/264220451/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/264327436","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/phoenix/pull/222#issuecomment-264327436","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/222","id":264327436,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NDMyNzQzNg==","user":{"login":"maryannxue","id":4171904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzE5MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4171904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue","html_url":"https://github.com/maryannxue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-01T23:26:26Z","updated_at":"2016-12-01T23:26:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"No differentiation between the regex functions (String based and Byte based)\r\n-- Let's just add support for this one?\r\nInvert and MD5 Function don't work (phoenix doesn't supply the correct arguments in annotation)\r\n-- Can we make it right, or is it more complicated than that? If the latter, we can open another issue.\r\nType matching doesn't work on input arguments (date/timestamp)\r\n-- It's probably a Calcite issue. Let's try repo it as a Calcite test case. Let me know if you need help working with Calcite unit tests.\r\nTimezone parameter doesn't work properly in ToDateFunction (basic cases work, but custom timezones do not act as expected)\r\nI probably know this one. Not sure if this is the issue though: the date/time/timestamp objects are local time (w/ timezone offset) in Calcite/Avatica, while they are UTC time on the Phoenix side.\r\nArray constructors are not supported (another issue entirely)\r\n-- Yes, another issue. We could open a JIRA listing those test failures blocking on this issue as a way to keep track of them.\r\n\r\nAs to the code refinement, I think there are 4 (maybe more?) big chunks of code: createBuiltinFunctions(), evaluateReturnType(), overloadArguments() and registerBuiltinFunctions(). We should probably put all these in one place. I prefer in PhoenixSchema, otherwise CalciteUtils could also do. What makes sense to where the code should live, aside from what class of object it instantiates, is also who is the caller or who decides the logic or routines. So it seems to me that PhoenixScalarFunction here is only the \"callee\" class which is used by PhoenixSchema and CalciteUtils.\r\nThere are a couple of things here that eventually forms the complete list of functions that we register in Calcite:\r\n1. We create multiple signatures corresponding to each overload of the same function.\r\n2. We merge all versions of the same signature but with different default parameter counts into one function.\r\n3. We deal with aliases.\r\nPart of the reason why we are doing this is that we are trying to reorganize the existing function dictionary into something that would match the Calcite conventions. The implementation could end up being very different if the existing Phoenix function structure were something else. So I guess it'd be easier to maintain if we put these methods all in one place and maybe we should add more code comment describing what each of these methods do.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/264327436/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/264331342","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/phoenix/pull/222#issuecomment-264331342","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/222","id":264331342,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NDMzMTM0Mg==","user":{"login":"lomoree","id":11578648,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTc4NjQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11578648?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lomoree","html_url":"https://github.com/lomoree","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lomoree/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lomoree/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lomoree/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lomoree/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lomoree/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lomoree/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lomoree/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lomoree/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lomoree/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-01T23:47:02Z","updated_at":"2016-12-01T23:47:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"1.
