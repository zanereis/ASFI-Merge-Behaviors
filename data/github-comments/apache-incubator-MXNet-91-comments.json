Remember to set MXNET_ENGINE_TYPE back to empty after debugging.\nAborted (core dumped)\n\nhow can I solve this problem?\n\nsorry to interrupt a day, thanks very much for sovling my problem\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/232624963/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/232630438","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/2696#issuecomment-232630438","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/2696","id":232630438,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMjYzMDQzOA==","user":{"login":"xlvector","id":100203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDIwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/100203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xlvector","html_url":"https://github.com/xlvector","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xlvector/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xlvector/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xlvector/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xlvector/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xlvector/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xlvector/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xlvector/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xlvector/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xlvector/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-14T10:45:46Z","updated_at":"2016-07-14T10:45:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"contexts = mx.context.cpu()\n\nwithout array\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/232630438/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/232632156","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/2688#issuecomment-232632156","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/2688","id":232632156,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMjYzMjE1Ng==","user":{"login":"KCHWang","id":16359774,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzU5Nzc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16359774?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KCHWang","html_url":"https://github.com/KCHWang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KCHWang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KCHWang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KCHWang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KCHWang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KCHWang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KCHWang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KCHWang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KCHWang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KCHWang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-14T10:54:36Z","updated_at":"2016-07-14T10:54:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@Godricly thanks!

I just started debugging it, and here's some early info: I am using a very simple graph: (array of 33 inputs) => concat of 33 => concat with another input => convolution => fc => softmax\n\nNow, when I get the abovementioned CHECK_NE failure, the offending node is `concat52_backward`, which is the backward node corresponding to the concatenation of 33 inputs.

However instead it has 33 inputs, the first one indeed going into `concat53_backward`, and the remaining 32 going into `concat52_backward`, in other words it has 32 unexpected inputs pointing to itself (effectively creating a loop).\n\nI am trying to figure out where they come from, but may be someone here who knows the code better can give me some pointers or guess possible reasons?\n\nThe second concat backward node (`concat53_backward`) has one input, and that input is connected to the convolution, as expected.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/232753263/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/232758685","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/2317#issuecomment-232758685","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/2317","id":232758685,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMjc1ODY4NQ==","user":{"login":"sxjscience","id":5178350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzgzNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5178350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience","html_url":"https://github.com/sxjscience","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-14T18:54:46Z","updated_at":"2016-07-14T18:54:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@SkidanovAlex Thanks for your work!

Hope that people will quickly fix this soon.\n\nOr you can revert to the version tagged `20160531`, it works good.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/233108515/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/233108782","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/2713#issuecomment-233108782","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/2713","id":233108782,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMzEwODc4Mg==","user":{"login":"piiswrong","id":568948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODk0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong","html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-16T05:10:20Z","updated_at":"2016-07-16T05:10:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ok.\nCould you do the following:\nchange eval_epoch to eval_period.\nAdd comment for eval_period\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/233108782/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/233109425","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/2722#issuecomment-233109425","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/2722","id":233109425,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMzEwOTQyNQ==","user":{"login":"were","id":2356965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTY5NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2356965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/were","html_url":"https://github.com/were","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/were/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/were/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/were/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/were/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/were/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/were/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/were/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/were/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/were/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-16T05:31:08Z","updated_at":"2016-07-16T05:31:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"How can I get the tensor?

So I do not think it is suitable to retrieve the internals values from the high-level `model` API (e.g. modify the train_model.py file). You are trying to get something that is designed to hide from you! So your task is more appropriate to use the Symbol API and simple_bind(), it is much easier.\n\nYou may also try the high-level Module API, which is recently added and designed for imperative calculation.

The pull request #2585 actually breaks the behavior of the Pooling operations.\n\nOriginally for `Convolution`, the shape is calculated with floor((H+2_pad-kernel)/stride+1), for `Pooling`, it is calculated as ceil((H+2_pad-kernel)/stride+1). Now the PR #2585 unifies both of them to floor((H+2*pad-kernel)/stride+1).\n\nI do advocate for this change. However, this behvior breaks the compatibility with existing models such as Inception-BN and many other Caffe models using 3x3/2 Pooling structures (e.g. GoogLeNet, ResNet).\n\nI think the ability to use existing pre-trained models is more important, so will the DMLC community revert this behavior back or provide a script to upgrade the models?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/233159895/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/233161922","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/2059#issuecomment-233161922","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/2059","id":233161922,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMzE2MTkyMg==","user":{"login":"xinghedyc","id":9301248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzMDEyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9301248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinghedyc","html_url":"https://github.com/xinghedyc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinghedyc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinghedyc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinghedyc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinghedyc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinghedyc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinghedyc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinghedyc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinghedyc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinghedyc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-17T02:40:24Z","updated_at":"2016-07-17T02:40:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi, I also got this problem when using gcc4.8 and g++4.8\nbut when I use gcc 5 and g++5, the compilation succeed.\nhope to help you.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/233161922/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
