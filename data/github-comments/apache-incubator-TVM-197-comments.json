Left a lot of feedback, overall would like to get some clarity in the docs and comments, and think about reducing away some of the concepts to better map to existing TVM systems, it seems like some of

Your review comments are really helpful!\r\nI agree that the original intention of our LoopState system is similar to the UnifiedIR to some extent.

Would like to followup on the general design directions. The PR as it is implements the features we want. However, it is equally important to think about the **minimalism**. \r\n\r\nIn particular, we want to implement the feature using a minimum set of concepts(APIs). The runtime module based interface is more like a interface convention instead of a common implementation that we use for packaging. We can imagine different kinds of implementations, GraphRuntimeFactory is one of them(for graph executions). We would also like as much de-coupling as possible.\r\n\r\nSo the ley challenge is -- how can we implement the features using as a minimum set of API interface as possible.\r\n\r\nWe can dissect the current API into two category of functionalities\r\n\r\n- F0: Load the module in, execute  \r\n- F1: Result of the relay.build, backward compatibility, write the module out.\r\n\r\nNotably, F0 and F1 does not have to use the same runtime.module implementations.\r\n\r\n## Minimum Design for F0 \r\n\r\nIf we focus on F0, we can find that we only need one interface for graph runtime in the C++ side(via Module API) -- the creation function:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom tvm.contrib import graph_runtime\r\ngmod = graph_runtime.GraphModule(mod['resnet18'](tvm.cpu(0)))\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotably, in the use cases of F0, we **do not** need the GraphRuntimeFactory wrapper(as the wrapper itself is primarily for backward compatiblity reasons).\r\n\r\n## Minimum Design for F1\r\n\r\nIf we do not need to support the additional features(e.g. disable `package_params` or `get_params`). Then no additional API is needed.\r\n\r\nWe would certainly need the `GraphFactoryModule` wrapper to hold the return value of relay.build. However, note that the wrapper is only needed for backward compatibility reason only. As a result, we do not need to place  `GraphFactoryModule` in the runtime folder, instead, we can just place it near under relay.backend, or close to `graph_runtime.py` for now. When we deprecate the old runtime API eventually, we could remove the python wrapper.\r\n\r\n## Discussions\r\n\r\nFrom the above discussions, we can find that the only really necessary API is the factory creation function. We could certainly expose `get_params` so users can obtain the parameters.\r\n\r\nThe current way of implementing `disable_params` should be simplified. First of all, we would prefer stateless classes as much as possible, so the API that switch a flag on and off is not really a good idea.\r\n\r\nOne potential way to address the problem is to still use a compositional API:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nmod = relay.build()\r\n# return a new GraphFactoryModule with params removed\r\n# mod_no_params does not need the GraphFactoryModule wrapping.\r\nmod_no_params = mod[\"remove_params\"]()\r\n# no params will be exported\r\nmod_no_params.export_library(\"xyz.so\")\r\n# params will be exported\r\nmod.export_library(\"xyz.so\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can discuss more API naming choices. Another parallel thread is how to create a debug runtime(if available). In this case, we could simply do ```mod[\"debug_create\"](\"default\", ctx.cpu(0))```.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/654347387/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/654350423","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/5958#issuecomment-654350423","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5958","id":654350423,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1NDM1MDQyMw==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-06T16:49:48Z","updated_at":"2020-07-06T16:49:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think the separation makes sense if we agreed on the categorization.

The migration to A1 possible though later.\r\n\r\nAnother point I want to do one round of quick discussion. When we tune single op / single layer network performance, we don't want to do cache flush so that we could get maximum performance. Previous pr use environment value could control it easily (setting it in tune_network but doesn't set it when to tune single layer network). If we fold it into time_evaluator, how to distinguish these two conditions? One method I could come up is we could add one extra tuning option (like `enable_cache_flush`, default value could be False) for measure.
