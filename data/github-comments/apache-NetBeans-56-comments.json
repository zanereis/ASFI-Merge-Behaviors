I don't think that we have to change the test codes absolutely if they work fine.\r\nSo, although I wrote above, I think that changing test codes should be separated from the same PR for *simple* :) We should change the test codes at last(after the issue is fixed) because there should be no problem if we add tests like existing codes.

But if I update tests of just a single class separately from the other work, there's not much worth in this kind of refactoring, it's not immediately clear what is the purpose of the change and what good does it bring. It should probably cover at least the whole module tests, but that could be be a lot of work, including for the reviewers.\r\n* Wouldn't splitting PRs mean that the second one will have to wait until the first one is merged, and due to merge window timings, it could mean a long time between the two PRs that are otherwise closely related?\r\n\r\nAlso, having to write tests only to rewrite them later seems like unnecessary work to me :)\r\n\r\n> I'll approve this PR after you add unit tests to `php.doctrine2`\r\n\r\nDo you mean add tests for methods wherever `AnnotationUtils.extractTypesFromParameters` is used?

On default behavior: Users frequently get annoyed when apps reach \"outside their sandbox\"--e.g. Acrobat Reader begging to be updated, web pages asking permission to send notifications, Chrome tabs playing audio, or Spotify showing an album cover overlay when you try to adjust volume for a different app. For this reason I think NetBeans notifications should be shown within NetBeans only, at least by default.\r\n\r\nMany users like it when an app behaves like the other apps and uses what the OS offers: notification center, keychains, configuration settings, etc.\r\n\r\nAnd I think such

So what is probably needed from my point of view is the possibility to have some (all?) notifications be sent to the OS notification as well, if desired by the user (with the possibility to link back to the real notification in the IDE if supported by the OS). Sounds like a long shot to get this done right??? I think the hook provided so far is especially useful for notifying inside the IDE (in whatever way), but a notification outside may just be another level e.g. (if native notifying module available forward to this as well, if configured by user).\r\n\r\nComments?\r\n\r\nThanks to @blackleg for kicking this off.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/586699847/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/586719534","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1948#issuecomment-586719534","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/1948","id":586719534,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NjcxOTUzNA==","user":{"login":"hectorespert","id":4323228,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjMyMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4323228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hectorespert","html_url":"https://github.com/hectorespert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hectorespert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hectorespert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hectorespert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hectorespert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hectorespert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hectorespert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hectorespert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hectorespert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hectorespert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-16T15:30:06Z","updated_at":"2020-02-16T15:30:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Should this be discussed first?
