This is considered a blocker for 4.6 so help is appreciated.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/140791892/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/140824594","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/775#issuecomment-140824594","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/775","id":140824594,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MDgyNDU5NA==","user":{"login":"rafaelweingartner","id":4129005,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjkwMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4129005?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelweingartner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-16T18:09:01Z","updated_at":"2015-09-16T18:09:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@DaanHoogland and @nitin-maharana, I was thinking about this PR.

Thus our code base is worsening in quality or at least in maintainability. However trivial we should keep refactorring and adding unit test in order to prevent things like \"First the method is huge (around 100 lines), and second it is a method that performs database access (it builds \"queries\" to retrieve data). Maybe,...\". I dont want to mis-quote you but am getting weary of all the reasons not to write unit tests.

So as you say let's refactor the method and add the unit tests. even when trivial at the moment and discarding 90% of them along the way we will not regret putting in the effort.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/140910285/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/140915157","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/775#issuecomment-140915157","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/775","id":140915157,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MDkxNTE1Nw==","user":{"login":"rafaelweingartner","id":4129005,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjkwMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4129005?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelweingartner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-16T22:44:52Z","updated_at":"2015-09-16T22:44:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@ DaanHoogland, I understand you, I just commented that to show to @nitin-maharana that “we” (I) understand that writing a test case to a method like that can be pretty hard, and that we are open to discuss and help with that. \n\nI just wanted to show support, because I have seen in other open source projects people rejecting PRs, just because the guy that created the PR is not well-known in the community and he/she had not written test cases for huge methods in which the developer had just made a pretty small fix like @nitin-maharana is doing. Most of the time developers debug the code, looking for the crux of the problem he/she is having, find and fix it without knowing the whole idea of the method, especially when methods have generic names, perform a lot of tasks and do not have proper java docs.\n\nFor instance: when I read, “cleanupDomain”, I do not fully understand what the method is doing. Is it a periodical task that is intended to remove dirty from domains? Is it meant to remove resources that are no longer used by users of a domain?\n\nI know that one of the tasks of that method is to remove/disable domains and their sub-domains, but to disable/remove something for me is different from cleaning something up.\n\nEvery time I review a code and see a clear opportunity to extract code and write test cases I suggest that, but when that does not happens, I do not feel comfortable asking for them and blocking a PR. That might not feel welcoming for a new contributor that is devoting some of his/her time for free in a project.\n\nBottom line is that we liked the job he has done and are here to help him with ideas in how to write at least one test case for the change he has made.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/140915157/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/140980562","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/836#issuecomment-140980562","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/836","id":140980562,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MDk4MDU2Mg==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-17T06:28:22Z","updated_at":"2015-09-17T06:28:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[cloudstack-pull-rats #639](https://builds.apache.org/job/cloudstack-pull-rats/639/) SUCCESS\nThis pull request looks good\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/140980562/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/140983520","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/829#issuecomment-140983520","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/829","id":140983520,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MDk4MzUyMA==","user":{"login":"remibergsma","id":1630096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzAwOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1630096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma","html_url":"https://github.com/remibergsma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-17T06:41:19Z","updated_at":"2015-09-17T06:41:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@resmo You're right and I wasn't clear enough I guess.

there @rafaelweingartner,\n\nNo hard feelings, dude. \n\nLong story short:\n- we are going through a critical phase with ACS - release\n- I have been working on ACS since 2013, and it's always the same. We stable master, we have a release and after that master is screwed again. After 6 months we go through this infinite loop of mess and nightmares.\n- ACS is super uber tightly coupled, by the [bad] design it has. If I would tell you that we had production problems because of 1 class of 1 hypervisor, that we don't even use, was f*dup, you wouldn't believe me. So, any simple change has the potential to make a huge mess. That's why the tests, etc.\n- ACS is used by many companies, small and big ones. e have to take good care of it.\n- I respect your efforts and also the guys working with you. I will be an student till I die!\n\nIf you can find a way to apply/submit your changes in an progressive way, I'm more than glad to help.\n\nCheers,\nWilder\n\nP.S.: adamantium claws, you know...

to this PR as I am not able to follow how the change is related to the bug. Also this is going to impact any HV having VM changes outside of CS like Vmware and Hyper-V.\n\nCS updates the power state of a VM to \"missing\" when HV doesn't report that VM for 2 consecutive ping intervals (ping.interval). Now if due to any operation in the HV the VM is not available for more than 2 ping interval then as per current behaviour CS tries to do the same thing as \"power off\" state.\n\nThe bug reported is that VR is getting rebooted. Earlier there was a logic to reboot VR if it has moved out-of-band from one host to another. That code is no longer there. So it needs to be seen if the bug is still happening.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/141377920/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/141392675","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/848#issuecomment-141392675","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/848","id":141392675,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MTM5MjY3NQ==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-18T09:20:34Z","updated_at":"2015-09-18T09:20:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[cloudstack-pull-rats #652](https://builds.apache.org/job/cloudstack-pull-rats/652/) SUCCESS\nThis pull request looks good\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/141392675/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/141403050","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/829#issuecomment-141403050","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/829","id":141403050,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MTQwMzA1MA==","user":{"login":"DaanHoogland","id":2486961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODY5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2486961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland","html_url":"https://github.com/DaanHoogland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-18T09:39:31Z","updated_at":"2015-09-18T09:39:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@koushik-das I am perfectly fine with not putting this code in but I don't understand that you don't follow how it is related to the bug reported.

It seems very clear to e that this is a bug in the state machine. The result is that the router is rebooted causing downtime for the users. If @resmo is satisfied with the solution @anshul1886 suggests we will settle for this bug remaining in?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/141403050/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/141404233","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/849#issuecomment-141404233","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/849","id":141404233,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MTQwNDIzMw==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-18T09:42:08Z","updated_at":"2015-09-18T09:42:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[cloudstack-pull-rats #653](https://builds.apache.org/job/cloudstack-pull-rats/653/) SUCCESS\nThis pull request looks good\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/141404233/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/141407138","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/829#issuecomment-141407138","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/829","id":141407138,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MTQwNzEzOA==","user":{"login":"resmo","id":23809,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23809?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/resmo","html_url":"https://github.com/resmo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/resmo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/resmo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/resmo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/resmo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/resmo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/resmo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/resmo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/resmo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/resmo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-18T09:50:53Z","updated_at":"2015-09-18T09:50:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@koushik-das @DaanHoogland  unless we have a \"better\" solution I would like to go with @anshul1886 suggested fix.
