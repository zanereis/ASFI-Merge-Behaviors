for cmake. On specifics:\r\n1. while we can provide the option to statically link dependencies, how to bring in dependencies is still the concern of a user. So the option of linking shared objects or specifying a search path should be supported by cmake. OpenCV and a number of other packages does it.\r\n2. I haven't had enough experience in using cmake in mxnet to make a call on whether all use cases are supported in our cmake file. I know for sure that the makefile has served me well. So I'd suggest that during transition we only add new options to cmake while still maintaining makefile for the old options, until there's enough confidence in cmake.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/345414560/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/345415153","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/8702#issuecomment-345415153","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/8702","id":345415153,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NTQxNTE1Mw==","user":{"login":"cjolivier01","id":11234557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjM0NTU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11234557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01","html_url":"https://github.com/cjolivier01","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-18T03:31:00Z","updated_at":"2017-11-18T03:31:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I am not aware of any build option that CMake doesn’t support — I’ve been keeping it current.
