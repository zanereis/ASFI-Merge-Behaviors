It's because there's a deadlock in C++ client. I'll push a PR soon.\r\n\r\nJust because C++ stand library doesn't have something like `ConcurrentHashMap`, the current implementation used a `mutex_` to share a `std::map`.\r\nHowever, the `mutex_` is also acquired in `receive`, so if you called `receive`, the `mutex_` is acquired and held until a new message was pushed to the internal message queue. Then if the topic discovery timer found new topics, the callback to add new topics also needed to acquire the `mutex_`, which leads to a deadlock.\r\n\r\nThe deadlock problem is similar to my PR before, see the change of `PartitionedConsumerImpl::receive` in #6732.

@hangc0276 we can add this change first. Can you add a configuration setting either in bookkeeper side or pulsar side to allow excluding jvm settings?

As bookkeeper client metric, it should not import the external jvm and other metrics. I will fix it on bookkeeper side, but it depend on the bookkeeper release.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/640347668/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/640353504","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/6865#issuecomment-640353504","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/6865","id":640353504,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MDM1MzUwNA==","user":{"login":"codelipenghui","id":12592133,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTkyMTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12592133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui","html_url":"https://github.com/codelipenghui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-08T04:10:40Z","updated_at":"2020-06-08T04:10:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@avimas Could you please take a look at the failed CI tests?
