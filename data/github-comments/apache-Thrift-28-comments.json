patch only flxes cpp-cpp (http) failures. B/c the deeper issue is that the Thrift cpp stack (both client & server) is nonstandard.\r\n\r\nI think I mentioned that I could improve this a bit, by having the client not wait for the reply from the server, but the server would eventually deliver it anyway.  The client would keep track of of how many replies it had ignored, and when it came time to actually want to see a reply, it woud skip past the requisite # of ignored replies.  Also (of course), you'd want to only ignore replies up to some limit -- or you could deadlock.\r\n\r\nNot very hard to do, actually.  And this would also fix cpp(client)-http-<anylang>(server) tests.  BUT it would NOT fix <anylang>(client)-http<anylang>(server) tests, b/c (from what I remember of my little stroll thru code) (almost?) all the other languages' HTTP stacks assume an RPC model for how applications will use the client HTTP stack.  So they're written with \"send request, immediately turn around and wait for response\" as the model.\r\n\r\nHope this helps.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/356806800/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/356825426","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/1445#issuecomment-356825426","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/1445","id":356825426,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NjgyNTQyNg==","user":{"login":"jeking3","id":11771245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzcxMjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11771245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3","html_url":"https://github.com/jeking3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-11T04:58:19Z","updated_at":"2018-01-11T04:58:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'll watch for a passing build, and then merge tomorrow if it's good.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/356825426/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/356922336","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/1458#issuecomment-356922336","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/1458","id":356922336,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NjkyMjMzNg==","user":{"login":"allengeorge","id":69364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/allengeorge","html_url":"https://github.com/allengeorge","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allengeorge/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allengeorge/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allengeorge/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allengeorge/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allengeorge/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allengeorge/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allengeorge/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allengeorge/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allengeorge/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-11T12:39:03Z","updated_at":"2018-01-11T12:39:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jeking3 Thank you!\r\n\r\nSo...updated the PR to re-add the three failing tests.

If this is failing then something changed in the code that restricted the TLS to one level.\r\n\r\nWe currently use SSLv23 handshake and disable the use of SSLv2 and SSLv3, so that the client can connect at TLSv1.0 or higher.\r\n\r\nThere's a story in the backlog to move all languages by default up to TLSv1.2 to improve security.\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/THRIFT-3165\r\n\r\nImplementing that across the board would be verified by modifying tls.sh in test/features so that TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1 was NOT expected to allow a connection by default.\r\n\r\nWhat I have found is that if you specify a handshake at TLSv10, then ONLY TLSv1.0 is allowed to connect.   It doesn't allow TLSv1.1 or TLSv1.2 to connect. If you specify a SSLv23 handshake, but disable SSLv2 and SSLv3 negotiation, then any client can connect and they can only negotiate at TLSv1.0 or later, which is the current behavior we have.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/357294172/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/357295698","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/1449#issuecomment-357295698","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/1449","id":357295698,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NzI5NTY5OA==","user":{"login":"vgotra","id":896830,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NjgzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/896830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vgotra","html_url":"https://github.com/vgotra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vgotra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vgotra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vgotra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vgotra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vgotra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vgotra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vgotra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vgotra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vgotra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-12T17:02:55Z","updated_at":"2018-01-12T17:07:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hm - for csharp for tests I enabled validation of any certificate to be successful\r\n``` csharp\r\n ((sender, certificate, chain, errors) => true, )\r\n```\r\n in server tests code\r\nDo you think I should revert it to check ?
