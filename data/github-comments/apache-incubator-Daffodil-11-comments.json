made some cleanup changes for removing SAX from the CLI tool, but I didn't address the following from Mike B:\r\n\r\nEx: there should be no code in DataProcessor associated with particular SAX handlers, and no base classes or traits one must derive from in order to use our SAX API. I think the requirements were not clear, and SAX is for some reason fairly confusing. But there are things we need only for unit testing that are in the primary libraries.\r\n\r\nEx: Class DaffodilParseXMLReader and Class DaffodilUnparseContentHandler are defined as if they are part of our API, when they should just be under src/test.\r\n\r\nDaffodilParseXMLReader and DaffodilUnparseContentHandler to me seem like they might be necessary as I believe they are responsible for translating the various SAX events into something that Daffodil understands.  I feel like these, or something similar, are necessary in order for someone to use Daffodil with SAX.  I feel like it shouldn't be required of someone using the API to have to define something for Daffodil to be able understand SAX events.\r\n\r\nI do think the API could be smoothed out in this regard, where the DaffodilParseXMLReader and DaffodilUnparseContentHandler aren't really exposed by the API.  For example, when parsing we are currently happy to accept a users ContentHandler, but then the user needs to call DFDL.DataProcessor.newXMLReaderInstance to get the current processors XMLReader, and then set that XMLReader's ContentHandler to the one they are trying to pass into Daffodil.  To me this feels pretty clunky and could be hidden, but I haven't looked at this long enough to come up with a cleaner solution.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/1185693570/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/1186003285","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/812#issuecomment-1186003285","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/812","id":1186003285,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhBG1s5GsPlV","user":{"login":"mbeckerle","id":1524099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1524099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle","html_url":"https://github.com/mbeckerle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-15T22:42:44Z","updated_at":"2022-07-15T22:42:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Binary data test files need to be added to the rat-check exclusions.

The XMLInfosetInputter/Outputter doesn't have any knowledge about whether simple type came from parsed data or from calcuclated data via inputValueCalc. It's all just a string to it.

So an XML Schema that uses this feature would look something like this:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<xs:element name=\"payload\" type=\"xs:string\" dfdlx:runtimeProperty=\"stringAsXml=true\" ... />\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the schema to validate this would look like this:\r\n```xml\r\n<xs:element name=\"payload\">\r\n  <xs:complexType>\r\n    <xs:choice>\r\n      <xs:element name=\"stringAsXml\">\r\n        <xs:complexType>\r\n          <xs:sequence>\r\n            <xs:element ref=\"pre:foo\" />\r\n          </xs:sequence>\r\n        </xs:complexType>\r\n      </xs:element>\r\n      <xs:element name=\"invalidXml\" type=\"xs:string\" maxLength=\"0\" />\r\n    </xs:choice>\r\n  </xs:complexType>\r\n</xs:element>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere the `pre:foo` reference changes depending on what the actual XML content is.\r\n\r\nThe only potential consideration I can think of is currently we write the XML directly to the OutputStream. To support the invalidXml idea, we would need to write the XML to a temporary string buffer, and only write it out to the OutputStream if the XMLStreamReader finished successfully.

The issue is that sbt-native-packager was updated to depend on scala-xml 2.1.0, but sbt-scoverage depends on scala-xml 1.3.0. Because of the major version change, SBT views these is incompatible and requires a change somewhere.\r\n\r\nOne solution is to manually override this by putting this in the plugins.sbt file:\r\n```\r\ndependencyOverrides ++= Seq(\r\n  \"org.scala-lang.modules\" %% \"scala-xml\" % \"2.1.0\",\r\n)\r\n```\r\nI've tested this and it seems to work: https://github.com/stevedlawrence/daffodil/runs/8119251364?check_suite_focus=true\r\n\r\nOne downside is I don't think scala-steward updates these dependencyOverrides, so this version will never be updated unless we manually update it. It's also possible there actually is a binary incompatibility that just isn't showing up.\r\n\r\nAnother option is to just wait for sbt-scoverage to update to scala-xml 2.x. Though, they don't currently have a ticket for this, and it's unclear when/if it will happen. \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/1233236970/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/1233239709","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/826#issuecomment-1233239709","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/826","id":1233239709,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhBG1s5Jgb6d","user":{"login":"stevedlawrence","id":3180601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODA2MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3180601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence","html_url":"https://github.com/stevedlawrence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-31T17:50:22Z","updated_at":"2022-08-31T17:50:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Another option, switch to a different coverage tool, e.g. [sbt-jacoco](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-jacoco/).

compatibility.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/1285755832/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/1285757349","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/857#issuecomment-1285757349","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/857","id":1285757349,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhBG1s5Moxml","user":{"login":"stevedlawrence","id":3180601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODA2MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3180601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence","html_url":"https://github.com/stevedlawrence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-20T15:34:43Z","updated_at":"2022-10-20T15:34:43Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Closing,
