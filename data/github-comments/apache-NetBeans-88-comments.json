Yes handling of embedded source is not optimal, but I have to see if it is possible to discern the cases:\r\n\r\n- CSS/SCSS/LESS stand alone\r\n- CSS in style tag\r\n- CSS in style attribute\r\n- CSS recognized in ID attributes\r\n- CSS in style tags, that contain other embedded code sequences (PHP)\r\n\r\nThe current state should be robust enough to work in any of these situations, but especially the last case makes it difficult to handle.\r\n\r\nFor the usage of node based tools: From my POV a straight no. NetBeans has a single hard dependency on an installed node when it comes to the typescript support. In that case I can live with it, as you'll need node anyway to do anything relevant with typescript sources anyway. The same is not true for CSS. CSS is used in JSF, JSP and JavaFX and for these groups there is zero reason to install a secondary tool, just to do some CSS formatting.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/884338398/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/884397227","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/3018#issuecomment-884397227","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/3018","id":884397227,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M40ttSr","user":{"login":"pepness","id":9832133,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MzIxMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9832133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepness","html_url":"https://github.com/pepness","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepness/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepness/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepness/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepness/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepness/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepness/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepness/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepness/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepness/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-21T18:23:15Z","updated_at":"2021-07-21T18:23:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Testing it now.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/884397227/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/884442323","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/3043#issuecomment-884442323","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/3043","id":884442323,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M40t4TT","user":{"login":"eirikbakke","id":886243,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NjI0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/886243?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke","html_url":"https://github.com/eirikbakke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-21T19:32:06Z","updated_at":"2021-07-21T19:32:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"What is the use case for this feature?\r\n\r\nIt might be better to make this work with the regular Copy action--i.e. if you copy a node that happens to be a class, and try to paste it into a text editor, it will paste the fully qualified class name.

think that having 'copy qualified name' on file node may not be the best idea. After all, project explorer view is file-oriented, not class-oriented. As someone noted, (simple) name, qualified name or file paths are valid text/plain `Transferables` for a file node. FWIW, the basic Copy should copy a filename or project-relative path to the file into `text/plain` targets, but that's out of scope here.\r\n\r\nAlso note that there may be *multiple* qualified name(s) as the file can contain nested classes, for example. Or even worse, multiple toplevel classes, which is not widely used, but valid. In this case, copy FQN on file node is not sufficient, or may be misleading (copies the 1st or public toplevel class FQN only). \r\n\r\nThe mentioned (obsolete) plugin integrates with the Navigator (which allows to copy FQNs of individual classes based on navigator node selection) and Java Editor (which allows the same by inspecting caret position -> ElementHandle at that position). With a shortcut attached to the navigator / editor action, this could be better approach: Goto Type -> open file (caret positions) -> shortcut-copy-fqn (fqn of found class copied) -> CTRL-F4 (previous editor selects) ->

After all, project explorer view is file-oriented, not class-oriented. As someone noted, (simple) name, qualified name or file paths are valid text/plain `Transferables` for a file node. FWIW, the basic Copy should copy a filename or project-relative path to the file into `text/plain` targets, but that's out of scope here.\r\n> \r\n> Also note that there may be _multiple_ qualified name(s) as the file can contain nested classes, for example. Or even worse, multiple toplevel classes, which is not widely used, but valid. In this case, copy FQN on file node is not sufficient, or may be misleading (copies the 1st or public toplevel class FQN only).\r\n> \r\n> The mentioned (obsolete) plugin integrates with the Navigator (which allows to copy FQNs of individual classes based on navigator node selection) and Java Editor (which allows the same by inspecting caret position -> ElementHandle at that position). With a shortcut attached to the navigator / editor action, this could be better approach: Goto Type -> open file (caret positions) -> shortcut-copy-fqn (fqn of found class copied) -> CTRL-F4 (previous editor selects) -> paste.\r\n\r\nI slightly agree that the position in projects view might not be optimal. On the other hand I wonder if the other menu entries apply to a file only context. e.g. `Find usages` looks for class usage not for the file usage.\r\n\r\nI fully agree that - in case a menu entry is available in editor view - it should be caret position aware as I also see the end user expectation to be that way. So I removed that entry for now.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/890586098/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
