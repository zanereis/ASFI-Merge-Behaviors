What I don't see is a simple or CSS-based path to fix this. \r\n\r\nTo have the fly-out menu of options _NOT_ cut off by the scroll area which _DOES_ cut off the select pulldown inputs, we'd have to have two branches of elements on the DOM tree, and keep them positionally synchronized during scrolling/windowResize events. Not really React's strong suit, but possible. It would also mean building the inputs/menus with new components and not involving the `react-virtualized-select` module (which is not supported anymore anyway), and building something custom, using some other virtualized list library.\r\n\r\nGiven the time involvement of what it would take to solve this issue while keeping the component working/looking like it does today, I think we should postpone this as we consider a larger design solution around (potentially) a global filters component/system which may ultimately deprecate or replace this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/551224924/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/551292988","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/8529#issuecomment-551292988","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/8529","id":551292988,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MTI5Mjk4OA==","user":{"login":"willbarrett","id":1779034,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzkwMzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1779034?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willbarrett","html_url":"https://github.com/willbarrett","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willbarrett/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willbarrett/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willbarrett/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willbarrett/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willbarrett/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willbarrett/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willbarrett/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willbarrett/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willbarrett/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-07T22:20:21Z","updated_at":"2019-11-07T22:20:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Would it be worth wrapping this in a test?

I think this has several parallels with Row Level Security, and probably should be done in several steps to avoid overcomplicating things for now. To keeps things simple I'm thinking we should first make sure `url_params` passed to the dashboard flow through to the chart like they do in the Explore view, and once that's done start introducing additional layers of security. I'm still planning on doing a PR for this, but if someone else wants to take the lead I'm happy to help as needed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/552073984/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/552082793","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/8527#issuecomment-552082793","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/8527","id":552082793,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MjA4Mjc5Mw==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-09T09:33:27Z","updated_at":"2019-11-09T09:33:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8527?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#8527](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8527?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/commit/ec476fc67e7aefcb99e8a1074597a6faa406e11f?src=pr&el=desc) will **decrease** coverage by `<.01%`.\n> The diff coverage is `100%`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8527/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=KsB0fHcx6l&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8527?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@            Coverage Diff             @@\n##           master    #8527      +/-   ##\n==========================================\n- Coverage   66.68%   66.67%   -0.01%     \n==========================================\n  Files         449      449              \n  Lines       22687    22698      +11     \n  Branches     2366     2368       +2     \n==========================================\n+ Hits        15128    15135       +7     \n- Misses       7421     7425       +4     \n  Partials      138      138\n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8527?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [...uperset/assets/src/dashboard/components/Header.jsx](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8527/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-c3VwZXJzZXQvYXNzZXRzL3NyYy9kYXNoYm9hcmQvY29tcG9uZW50cy9IZWFkZXIuanN4) | `43.24% <100%> (+1.04%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [superset/db\\_engine\\_specs/postgres.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8527/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-c3VwZXJzZXQvZGJfZW5naW5lX3NwZWNzL3Bvc3RncmVzLnB5) | `55.55% <0%> (-27.78%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [superset/db\\_engine\\_specs/base.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8527/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-c3VwZXJzZXQvZGJfZW5naW5lX3NwZWNzL2Jhc2UucHk=) | `80.33% <0%> (-0.26%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [superset/views/database/forms.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8527/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-c3VwZXJzZXQvdmlld3MvZGF0YWJhc2UvZm9ybXMucHk=) | `91.11% <0%> (ø)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [superset/assets/src/setup/setupColors.js](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8527/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-c3VwZXJzZXQvYXNzZXRzL3NyYy9zZXR1cC9zZXR1cENvbG9ycy5qcw==) | `0% <0%> (ø)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [superset/db\\_engine\\_specs/hive.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8527/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-c3VwZXJzZXQvZGJfZW5naW5lX3NwZWNzL2hpdmUucHk=) | `28.18% <0%> (+0.32%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [superset/views/database/views.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8527/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-c3VwZXJzZXQvdmlld3MvZGF0YWJhc2Uvdmlld3MucHk=) | `92.15% <0%> (+8.64%)` | :arrow_up: |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8527?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8527?src=pr&el=footer).
