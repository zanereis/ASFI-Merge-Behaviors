So, in the best possible case, you could use Groovy to be like a Lombok processor and produce Java classes which don't need the Groovy runtime jars to work successfully. As mentioned earlier, that isn't the case for all but the very simplest of cases today but we can expand over time - Records (or record-like classes) could be an early focus.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/692377636/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/693216686","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/1366#issuecomment-693216686","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/1366","id":693216686,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5MzIxNjY4Ng==","user":{"login":"paulk-asert","id":280016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MDAxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/280016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert","html_url":"https://github.com/paulk-asert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-16T07:04:58Z","updated_at":"2020-09-16T07:04:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Parts of this look good but we can possibly re-work to increase the likelihood of being able to extend to `StreamingMarkupBuilder`.

There are different getter naming conventions, special serialization rules and some other restrictions on records. The goal here would eventually be to create native records with Groovy syntax, so yes a `record` keyword would be part of that but I don't think that aspect needs to be sorted before alpha-1 and can be done later like `trait` was added later for `@Trait`. The AST transform I think is useful enough in it's own right and would allow record-like classes to be created in the meantime until we consider native record support.

In order to migrate to the `maven-publish` plugin, I ended up refactoring the build to make it cleaner, more idiomatic. Work is not complete but I could spend weeks on that.\r\n\r\nThe new build is, IMO, much easier to understand. I tried to remove bad practices I found, and I tested that I could publish on a local artifactory server with signing. The new publications are richer and use Gradle Module Metadata.\r\n\r\nAlso I took the liberty to remove the \"backports\" modules. Reintroducing wouldn't be too hard, but AFAIK they haven't really been used, and now there's only a 2.3 backport, and we're talking about Groovy 4.\r\n\r\nI'm going to continue a bit on this but I'd appreciate that you play a bit with this branch to find out if they are obvious problems: during the refactoring it's possible I've slightly changed the outputs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/701697763/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/702426140","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/1382#issuecomment-702426140","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/1382","id":702426140,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwMjQyNjE0MA==","user":{"login":"melix","id":316357,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNjM1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/316357?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/melix","html_url":"https://github.com/melix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melix/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-01T22:15:53Z","updated_at":"2020-10-01T22:15:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"PR looks fine from my POV.

I don't know for sure though and we'd need to run a little benchmark analysis to better guide our decisions. Secondly, returning `null` isn't likely to play nicely with existing code that users this. I think we'd just fail fast and wrap the IOException in a RuntimeException and throw that.\r\nAs you already spotted, CharBuf.close is currently a no-op, and the impacted classes aren't likely to be changed much, so all the above seems like a bit of an overkill reaction to the issue.\r\nMy recommendation would be just to add a comment saying something like \"consider wrapping in a try with resources block if CharBuf is ever refactored to have a non-empty close()\".
