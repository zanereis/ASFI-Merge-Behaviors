However, a specific scenario for upserts is that if we set indefinite retention and rely on UpsertCompaction to purge segments, empty segments won't be included. This is because we don't add `EmptyIndexSegment` to _trackedSegments, which ultimately leads to them being skipped in the snapshot flow as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2181290944/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2181314410","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/13442#issuecomment-2181314410","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/13442","id":2181314410,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c6CBDdq","user":{"login":"prasad-maladi","id":72404534,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNDA0NTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72404534?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prasad-maladi","html_url":"https://github.com/prasad-maladi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prasad-maladi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prasad-maladi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prasad-maladi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prasad-maladi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prasad-maladi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prasad-maladi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prasad-maladi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prasad-maladi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prasad-maladi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-20T18:44:03Z","updated_at":"2024-06-20T18:44:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"payload is encryted in our case, we have properties which can decrypt the payload in metadata object.
