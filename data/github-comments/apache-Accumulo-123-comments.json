For example, a NoClassDefFoundError can occur because of an exception in a static initializer block while trying to load a class. One problem is that that static initializer can change some JVM-wide state before it fails, leading to an unknowable state. So, even though the class couldn't load, it doesn't mean the JVM is in a knowable good state. These errors are fatal because they can leave the JVM in a bad, often unknowably bad, state.\r\n\r\nBased on [this](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se11/html/jvms-5.html#jvms-5.5) and its preceding sections, I\"m not sure that this can happen.

To deal with this could either use fate or generalize the mechanism that compaction use to do the refresh.  However the compaction mechanism has an issue open to use FATE and jettison its custom mechanism.  Bulk import also refreshes tablets, but its running in FATE so it makes things simple.\r\n \r\nWith the above in mind, thinking could take the following approach for this change.\r\n \r\n * After the first full scan by the TabletGroupWatcher where it sees no tablets need volume replacements, then it no longer will ask the TabletMgmtIterator to look for volume replacements for all of its subsequent full scans.  Seems like after this point it could alway pass an empty list of volume replacements to the tabletmgmtiterator.\r\n\r\n * For tablets that need volume replacement, we unassign them or avoid assigning them if they are not assigned.

Currently the table locks prevents other operations from running concurrently with merge.  The following is an initial pass of thinking through problems with table operations and merge.\r\n\r\n\r\n## User compactions\r\n\r\nUser compactions create two tablet metadata columns, one for running compactions and one for completed compactions.  Without table locks, merge would need to handle these in some way.  These columns can not be copied during a merge operation.  Would conceptually want merge to wait on compaction or cancel them.  A nice behavior would be if merge cancels running compactions and lets existing completed compaction markers be processed before starting to merge.  \r\n\r\n * Merge places operation id on tablet and in the same mutation deletes any entries for running compactions.\r\n * After placing the operation ids, merge waits for all tablets to have no location and no compaction completed markers.  \r\n\r\nThe above would make merge wait on completed compactions to be acknowledged without waiting on running compactions or allowing new compactions to start until after the merge is complete.\r\n\r\n## Bulk import\r\n Bulk import adds loaded markers to tablets.  During merge these loaded markers would need to be handled.  Currently bulk import does the following.\r\n\r\n 1. Checks that its load mapping aligns with actual split points in the table and if not throws a concurrent merge exception. The checks for merge that happened between file inspection to create the load mapping and acquiring the table lock.\r\n 2. Starts loading files into tablets with the assumption that a concurrent merge will not happen because of the table lock. Write load columns to individual tablets.\r\n 3.  After all tablets are loaded, deletes the loaded mappings from each tablet.\r\n\r\nThe reason step 1 is done that files need to be imported into the exact tablets specified.  However with the ability of files to now have ranges, it may be that if the load mapping does not align with the tables splits that we could add ranges to the bulk loaded files to handle this situation.  The merge operation could also adjust these ranges on loaded mappings like it does for file mappings, this would allow bulk import to detect ranges that are not completely covered.\r\n\r\nAdding ranges to the load mapping may also remove the need to ever throw concurrent merge exception in the bulk API, as concurrent merges could now be handled.  So maybe [this check](https://github.com/apache/accumulo/blob/c44216d7643c50830e0619a2037d4a8d20c15a01/server/manager/src/main/java/org/apache/accumulo/manager/tableOps/bulkVer2/PrepBulkImport.java#L181) could be modified or removed.\r\n\r\n## Split tablets\r\n\r\nSplit and merge both set operation ids on tablets, so this case is easy.  They can wait on each via the operation id.\r\n\r\n## Merge\r\n\r\nConcurrent merge operations that run on the same table with overlapping ranges could deadlock if acquiring operation ids is not done with care.  If merge operations observer other merge operations in the metadata table, one of them could remove its operation ids to let the other proceed.  Could be the merge operation with the highest fate tx id.  Relinquishing opids would only need to be done when a merge operation is in the phase of acquiring operation ids on all of its tablets.  Once a merge operation is past the acquisition phase, it can just complete and no longer needs to worry about relinquishing.\r\n\r\n## Clone\r\n\r\nThe clone code makes repeated passes over the source and destination metadata until convergence is confirmed.  This clone code is currently split tolerant, would need to make this code also merge tolerant.\r\n\r\n## Delete table\r\n\r\nIf delete table acquires operation ids on a tablet, then it will mostly be fine with concurrent merges.  However when a merge operation is in its acquisition phase, it should relinquish any operation ids it has obtained if it sees delete table operation ids.\r\n\r\n## Offline table\r\n\r\nCurrently taking a table offline would wait for any running merge to complete and after taking the table offline would prevent any merge from starting.  Without table locks this would be hard to achieve without placing information in each tablet for an offline table.  Maybe tablets could have a state of enabled or disabled (using terminology from #3860).  This per tablet state could have the following properties.\r\n \r\n * Can only transition to disabled when there are no operation ids and no location.\r\n * A merge operation can not set an operation id on a tablet if its state is disabled\r\n\r\nMaybe the APIs for online/offline of a table goes away and turns conceptually into a concept of enabling and disabling ranges of a table.\r\n\r\n## Export table\r\n\r\nExporting  a t table currently depends on the table being offline, so the conflict of offline with merge should consider export.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1781457175/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1781464698","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/3412#issuecomment-1781464698","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/3412","id":1781464698,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5qLv56","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-26T16:34:04Z","updated_at":"2023-10-26T16:34:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"One problem with not getting a tablet lock is that splits could run on an offline table.

For example consider the situation where a bulk import wants to load file F1 into tablets T1, T2, and T3.  Also concurrently a merge wants to merge tablets T1,T2, and T3.\r\n\r\n * bulk load F1 into T1 adding a loaded marker\r\n * merge code sets an operation id on tablet T2\r\n * bulk load F1 into T3 adding a loaded marker\r\n\r\nSince the merge operation set an opid on T2, the bulk operation can not load into it.  If the merge operation were to wait on the loaded markers on T1 and T2, then deadlock would happen.  If the merge operation were to continue and set operation ids on T1,T3 and then proceed with the merge, then it would need to merge the loaded markers.  If T1,T2,T3 were merged into tablet T4, then T4 would need load markers with ranges so that the bulk import code can reason about the missing T2 range that is needed to complete the bulk import.\r\n\r\nAdding ranges to the load markers introduces a lot of complexity into the bulk import code when there is not a strong need for it.  It would be easier to somehow prevent bulk import and merge from running concurrently.  Both are quick metadata operations (unlike compactions) so there is not performance penalty to preventing them from running concurrently.  Without table locks, a possible way to do this is to add a new metadata column that prevents merges from starting. Bulk import could then do the following.\r\n\r\n  * For each tablet in the bulk import range set a new column that prevents merge from starting.\r\n  * If the merge block was successfully set, then proceed with the bulk import w/o having to worry about partial load of data and a merge happening.\r\n\r\nIf the merge block and merge opid are both observed, then one operation needs to back out its changes and wait to let the other operation start. \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1781940214/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1782064768","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/3897#issuecomment-1782064768","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/3897","id":1782064768,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5qOCaA","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-26T23:26:34Z","updated_at":"2023-10-26T23:26:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Saw the following exception in the tserver where the metadata table could not close because its write to the root tablet failed.

As you said, in 2.1 it may be more redundant since the WALs are checked before but wouldn't hurt. It's definitely needed in 3.1 since those checks were removed when I removed chopped compactions.

This is to allow for overlapping bulk imports to load into those tablets.\r\n\r\nWith the above strategy bulk import and merge will not run concurrently.  Also bulk import does not have to take any extra step, only the merge code.   So since bulk import will run much more frequently than merge, its good to not add extra steps to bulk import to handle a rare condition.  One downside with this strategy is that its possible that merge could never run if there are continuous bulk imports.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1782952551/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1782963674","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/3892#issuecomment-1782963674","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/3892","id":1782963674,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5qRd3a","user":{"login":"alerman","id":119506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTUwNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/119506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alerman","html_url":"https://github.com/alerman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alerman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alerman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alerman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alerman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alerman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alerman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alerman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alerman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alerman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-27T13:56:30Z","updated_at":"2023-10-27T13:56:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@EdColeman  I can't remember the details exactly, but i can tell you with 100% confidence that I hit this error message.

Please add more comments if there are things I missed.  Meeting info [here](https://the-asf.slack.com/archives/CERNB8NDC/p1698351188844809)\r\n\r\nWith table locks the current behavior is that a merge operation will wait on a compaction or bulk import.  Consensus was it would be good to maintain this behavior.\r\n\r\nWith the current table locks, a merge can prevent compactions and bulk imports from running  even the ranges are disjoint.  Like in the the following situation.\r\n\r\n  1. Really long running user compaction is started on range (a,m]\r\n  2. Merge is initiated on range (o,p], however it can not start because of the compaction.  Places a write lock entry in the zookeeper table lock queue.\r\n  3. A bulk import for range (x,z] is initiated, but it blocks when is sees there is a write lock queued for the above merge.\r\n\r\nSo in the situation above a bulk import is blocked by a merge that is blocked by a long running user compaction.  Since these ranges are disjoint, if locking were moved to the tablet level all of the operations could proceed.\r\n\r\nAdding a tablet state of disabled would be useful for manual metadata edits.  We discussed how this aligns with the tablet hosting goal.  If a tablet has a hosting goal of never, then it will not be hosted but in elasticity compactions, splits, bulk import, etc could still change the tablet metadata.\r\n\r\nFor exporting a table, potentially having a partially disabled tablet is kinda confusing.  The export table operation could verify that all tablets are in the disabled state when it starts, but there is no way to prevent this from changing later.  Discussed have another tablet state of readonly or snapshot (snapshot is a terminal read only state).  So tablet export could require all the tablet to be in the snapshot state before it would start.\r\n\r\nDiscussed where the valid state transitions for tablet might exists in the code.  This could exists in ample, where it checks the transitions before its made.\r\n\r\nIf write locks were removed and fate storage was moved to a zookeeper table, then bulk imports may have zero zookeeper writes which may help with scalability.

In that case it was not only the monitor that could not handle the truth, but the tservers as well.  The monitor fell over, and the node became unaccessible because of the nober if IRQ requests hitting it from the tservers.  Many tservers fall over because of out of memory and many others had various threads die (out of memory) but remained running.  The result in the end was the entire system had to be brought down hard.\r\n\r\nSo, probably the best thing that can be done for this ticket is not to modify the monitor, but rather focus on the number of messages being sent by the tservers.  Even if there is a loop that is spamming messages (on the order of 1 per millisecond in that case), we should not be trying to send every single message to the monitor.  There needs to be some dedupping of messages done on the tserver side if possible and perhaps the queue size of messages being sent to the logger needs to be restricted in size.  I don't know if we can do this given we are using the standard logging infrastructure such as log4j but it should be investigated.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1790897950/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1790930637","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/3921#issuecomment-1790930637","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/3921","id":1790930637,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5qv27N","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-02T15:13:31Z","updated_at":"2023-11-02T15:13:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Before this change, the Monitor would likely show 0(0) for major compactions on the tserver page.

However, we came to the conclusion that making merge able to create a single tablet with more files than can fit in memory would cause problems for split, compaction, scan, etc.  Realized it was not worthwhile pursing these changes and decided it would be best to do the following.\r\n\r\n * Add a property that limits the amount files that would be merged into a single tablet.  For example if the limit was 10K and if a merge tried to run on 1000 tablets each having 100 files then it would fail before making any metadata changes.  If the merge ran then it would create a single tablet with 100K files.\r\n * Still allow merging a large number of tablets as long as there is not a large number of files.  For example merging 1 million tablets with a total of 100 file across all tablets would still work.\r\n\r\nGoing to close this PR, rework this code and open a new PR that supports the above.  \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1800218982/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1802550985","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/3934#issuecomment-1802550985","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/3934","id":1802550985,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5rcL7J","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-08T19:51:16Z","updated_at":"2023-11-08T19:51:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@cshannon I reopened this PR after making the changes 4113dc5.

Even if there is a loop that is spamming messages (on the order of 1 per millisecond in that case), we should not be trying to send every single message to the monitor. There needs to be some dedupping of messages done on the tserver side if possible and perhaps the queue size of messages being sent to the logger needs to be restricted in size. I don't know if we can do this given we are using the standard logging infrastructure such as log4j but it should be investigated.\r\n\r\nThis kind of thing can definitely done... I've already linked to the log4j docs on filters above that are capable of customizing the logging in the way you're interested in doing. If an existing filter isn't suitable, the APIs are very simple, and it should be easy to create a custom filter that keeps logs from flooding your systems based on your specific requirements.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1809203254/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1809297208","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/3946#issuecomment-1809297208","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/3946","id":1809297208,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5r1684","user":{"login":"cshannon","id":123009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzAwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon","html_url":"https://github.com/cshannon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-13T23:29:18Z","updated_at":"2023-11-13T23:29:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @keith-turner, I will take a look and see which of those options are best.
