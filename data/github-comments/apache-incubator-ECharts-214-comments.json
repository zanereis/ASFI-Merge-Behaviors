but please ask *how-to* questions on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/echarts). Here's why:\n\nMaintaining open source projects, especially popular ones, is [hard work](https://nolanlawson.com/2017/03/05/what-it-feels-like-to-be-an-open-source-maintainer/). As ECharts's user base has grown, we are getting more and more usage questions, bug reports, feature requests and pull requests every single day.\n\nAs a free and open source project, ECharts also has limited maintainer bandwidth. That means the only way to ensure the project's sustainability is to:\n\n1. Prioritize more concrete work (bug fixes and new features);\n2. Improve issue triaging efficiency.\n\nFor (1), we have decided to use the GitHub issue lists exclusively for work that has well-defined, actionable goals. Questions and open ended discussions should be posted to mediums that are better suited for them.\n\nFor (2), we have found that issues that do not provide proper information upfront usually results in terribly inefficient back-and-forth communication just to extract the basic information needed for actual triaging. This is exactly why we have created this app: to ensure that every issue is created with the necessary information, and to save time on both sides.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/494726063/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/494732891","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/10520#issuecomment-494732891","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/10520","id":494732891,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NDczMjg5MQ==","user":{"login":"echarts-bot[bot]","id":45089189,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDUwODkxODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/20872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/echarts-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-22T09:46:55Z","updated_at":"2019-05-22T09:46:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi!

Here's why:\n\nMaintaining open source projects, especially popular ones, is [hard work](https://nolanlawson.com/2017/03/05/what-it-feels-like-to-be-an-open-source-maintainer/). As ECharts's user base has grown, we are getting more and more usage questions, bug reports, feature requests and pull requests every single day.\n\nAs a free and open source project, ECharts also has limited maintainer bandwidth. That means the only way to ensure the project's sustainability is to:\n\n1. Prioritize more concrete work (bug fixes and new features);\n2. Improve issue triaging efficiency.\n\nFor (1), we have decided to use the GitHub issue lists exclusively for work that has well-defined, actionable goals. Questions and open ended discussions should be posted to mediums that are better suited for them.\n\nFor (2), we have found that issues that do not provide proper information upfront usually results in terribly inefficient back-and-forth communication just to extract the basic information needed for actual triaging. This is exactly why we have created this app: to ensure that every issue is created with the necessary information, and to save time on both sides.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/495048906/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/495049694","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/10074#issuecomment-495049694","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/10074","id":495049694,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NTA0OTY5NA==","user":{"login":"bubblegreen","id":3353379,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNTMzNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3353379?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bubblegreen","html_url":"https://github.com/bubblegreen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bubblegreen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bubblegreen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bubblegreen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bubblegreen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bubblegreen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bubblegreen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bubblegreen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bubblegreen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bubblegreen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-23T03:03:14Z","updated_at":"2019-05-23T03:03:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"遇到相同的问题～","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/495049694/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/495053947","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/10524#issuecomment-495053947","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/10524","id":495053947,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NTA1Mzk0Nw==","user":{"login":"vv-lin","id":44837766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODM3NzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44837766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vv-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/vv-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vv-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vv-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vv-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vv-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vv-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vv-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vv-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vv-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vv-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-23T03:29:13Z","updated_at":"2019-05-23T03:29:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"您好，非常感谢您百忙之中的答复！\r\n我没有仔细研究过ECharts的源码，所以不知道legend的具体实现过程。\r\n但是我有个构想，当然，这构想仅供参考：\r\n目前legend和series中的name必须一致，所以我简单粗暴的理解为，legend和series是通过名称关联。\r\n那么是不是可以让legend支持key-value这种模式呢，显示的时候是value，关联的时候是key。\r\n比如可以在legend中构建:\r\nlegend: {\r\n    data: [{name: 'key1', text: 'm<sup>3</sup>'}, {name: 'key2', text: 'Na<sup>+</sup>'}]\r\n}\r\n或：\r\nlegend: {\r\n    data: ['key1', 'key2'],\r\n    text: ['m<sup>3</sup>', 'Na<sup>+</sup>']\r\n}\r\n\r\n当然，如何构建只是方式而已，确立关联关系才是重点。这个改动量应该很大。\r\n\r\n\r\n鼠标悬停确实是指的tooltip，我的意思是如果legend中支持html，那么对应tooltip应该自动就变成了legend中的样式。\r\n举例：\r\nlegend中变成了‘m³’，那么在tooltip中如果显示m3就是不对的，应该默认就变成了‘m³’。\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------

but please ask *how-to* questions on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/echarts) or [segmentfault（中文）](https://segmentfault.com/t/echarts). \n\nHere's why:\n\nMaintaining open source projects, especially popular ones, is [hard work](https://nolanlawson.com/2017/03/05/what-it-feels-like-to-be-an-open-source-maintainer/). As ECharts's user base has grown, we are getting more and more usage questions, bug reports, feature requests and pull requests every single day.\n\nAs a free and open source project, ECharts also has limited maintainer bandwidth. That means the only way to ensure the project's sustainability is to:\n\n1. Prioritize more concrete work (bug fixes and new features);\n2. Improve issue triaging efficiency.\n\nFor (1), we have decided to use the GitHub issue lists exclusively for work that has well-defined, actionable goals. Questions and open ended discussions should be posted to mediums that are better suited for them.\n\nFor (2), we have found that issues that do not provide proper information upfront usually results in terribly inefficient back-and-forth communication just to extract the basic information needed for actual triaging. This is exactly why we have created this app: to ensure that every issue is created with the necessary information, and to save time on both sides.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/496059089/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/496059452","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/10542#issuecomment-496059452","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/10542","id":496059452,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NjA1OTQ1Mg==","user":{"login":"Ovilia","id":779050,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3OTA1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/779050?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ovilia","html_url":"https://github.com/Ovilia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ovilia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ovilia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ovilia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ovilia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ovilia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ovilia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ovilia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ovilia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ovilia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-27T02:42:02Z","updated_at":"2019-05-27T02:42:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Why do you think the data is incorrect?
