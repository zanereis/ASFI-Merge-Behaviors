I had overlooked the edge cases where the TimeTrigger might not fire or fires twice causing tests to fail.<br/>\n    The patch you have provided addresses the issue. Only concern is that the existing TimeEvictionPolicy uses System.currentTimeMillis() to evict the events so it relies on the passage of time to expire events and if you manually invoke the trigger, the expected events may not expire.</p>\n\n<p>    However I verified that the tests pass with your changes so it can be merged to fix the random test failures.</p>\n\n<p>    In <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/900\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/900</a> an api is added to set the reference timestamp for the eviction policy instead of it relying on system timestamp. With that PR I will fix the unit tests by setting the future timestamp to simulate passage of time and invoke the trigger manually.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612685986/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612628616","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/5025#issuecomment-2612628616","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/5025","id":2612628616,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI2Mjg2MTY=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-05T20:33:04Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T14:13:03Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=githubbot\">githubbot</a>:</i>\n<p>Github user arunmahadevan commented on a diff in the pull request:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/900#discussion_r46762681\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/900#discussion_r46762681</a></p>\n\n<p>    &#8212; Diff: storm-core/src/jvm/backtype/storm/windowing/TimeEvictionPolicy.java &#8212;<br/>\n    @@ -21,21 +21,30 @@</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Eviction policy that evicts events based on time duration.<br/>\n      */<br/>\n     public class TimeEvictionPolicy<T> implements EvictionPolicy<T> {</li>\n</ul>\n<ul class=\"alternate\" type=\"square\">\n\t<li>private final long duration;<br/>\n    +    private final int windowLength;<br/>\n    +    protected Long currentTs;\n\t<ul class=\"alternate\" type=\"square\">\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<ul class=\"alternate\" type=\"square\">\n\t\t\t<li>End diff &#8211;</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>    Its the reference time for the window calculation, based on which events are expired from the window.

thanks for your comment.  Topology priorities are relative to the user.  The main metric to compare uses is how much of their resource guarantee is satisfied.  Given the example your provide, the only reason why a topology from user A is going to be killed due to User B submitted a topology is because user A is above his or her resource guarantee given user B is below his or her resource guarantee. To prevent this happening, User A must have a higher resource guarantee or at least higher than user C if you want topologies from user C to be killed.  However, in my implementation the eviction strategy to use is a pluggable interface so you can easily add additional logic or create a whole entire eviction strategy to fit your needs\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/162585896/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/162589790","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/916#issuecomment-162589790","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/916","id":162589790,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MjU4OTc5MA==","user":{"login":"jerrypeng","id":3613359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTMzNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3613359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng","html_url":"https://github.com/jerrypeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-07T16:50:44Z","updated_at":"2015-12-07T16:50:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/162589790/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612682897","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/5199#issuecomment-2612682897","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/5199","id":2612682897,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI2ODI4OTc=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-07T16:50:46Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T14:37:21Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a
