It should be fast, so it does not slow down code review waiting for results. If Jenkins is faster, then it is definitely the best choice.\n\nBut I have a different stance on the meta-issue:\n1. Travis (or equivalent - even our own `.jenkins.sh`) piggybacks on our existing processes perfectly.\n   - Process: Code review of the configuration changes. This implies higher quality results and more transparency about when and why changes occur.\n   - Permissions: Anyone can propose a change in a PR, and any committer can accept it.\n   - Tools: Text editor, git. And the UI, while less powerful overall, is easier for newcomers.\n2. Travis has good integrations with lots of services. For example, you can use coveralls without a repo token :-)\n3. Travis is trivial to configure.\n\nJenkins has capabilities that Travis does not have:\n1. It has a nice test result UI. This is the only reason I can think of to run unit tests there.\n2. You can configure a build that won't just obey the instructions in a PR, so it can do more sensitive things or be very expensive to run. (integration tests, submit queue)\n3. Lots of plugins.\n4. (Hopefully) lower latency for uploading coverage.\n\nThese are compelling. We should use Jenkins for these things. But I don't see a strong reason to use it for more than that, especially since there are major downsides - no source control of config, more complex config, having to issue tickets to infra for some changes, silent back-channel changes, no review of config changes, no presubmit of config changes, no ability to synchronously alter config and code, ...\n\nFor now, I'd be happy to merge PRs and get immediate benefit from Travis until our Jenkins config is offering equivalent capabilities. Perhaps it will be quite soon, but the cost is zero either way.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/206691571/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/206696869","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/139#issuecomment-206696869","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/139","id":206696869,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNjY5Njg2OQ==","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-07T05:01:52Z","updated_at":"2016-04-07T05:01:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"R: @kennknowles also.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/206696869/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/206709317","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/92#issuecomment-206709317","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/92","id":206709317,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNjcwOTMxNw==","user":{"login":"dhalperi","id":526415,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNjQxNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/526415?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi","html_url":"https://github.com/dhalperi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-07T06:08:08Z","updated_at":"2016-04-07T06:08:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM, optional comments.

I did some brief checking into comparable libraries.\n- [lombok](https://projectlombok.org/): mutates the current class to add getters and setters. This is actually forbidden for annotation processors as I understand them, so I guess Lombok uses more fragile hooks to accomplish it. I agree with criticism that this is slightly more \"magical\", in a bad way.\n- [immutables](https://immutables.github.io/): very similar. They emphasize builders, which [autovalue can also provide](https://github.com/google/auto/blob/master/value/userguide/builders.md). Immutables works with interfaces, which seems nice.\n- [FreeBuilder](http://freebuilder.inferred.org/) (also originating from Google) is a subset of AutoValue and seems a lower vitality project.\n\nI am torn between my bias towards Google technology and the (admittedly modest) bonus of interface support in Immutables. Immutables also has some built-in support for Java standard lib classes - can you dig into the differences there?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/207015239/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/207030305","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/138#issuecomment-207030305","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/138","id":207030305,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNzAzMDMwNQ==","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-07T18:02:28Z","updated_at":"2016-04-07T18:02:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"BTW examining the latency, Jenkins is much much lower latency so we should go with Jenkins for this.
