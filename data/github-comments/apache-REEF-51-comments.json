I think the current design allows too much freedom for the user -- mainly, it will be hard for them to know how to generate a `Configuration` for a Vortex job. Personally, I feel that the cleanest way to do this is to switch `VortexConfHelper` into a Builder class and build a `VortexJobObject` (or what have you), using `Configuration` internally and allowing the user to pass in a `Configuration` that is merged with the main `DriverConfiguration` and `VortexMasterConf`. This allows us to utilize Tang to check our `Configuration` parameters for us while exposing a fairly clean interface. What do you think? \n2. There is a `TODO` in `VortexConfHelper` for REEF-1000 that configures the number of threads for the thread pool on callbacks.

I agree the current code is too flexible. So are you suggesting to have a builder in `VortexConfHelper`, which creates an object we can use to build configuration internally, so users can figure out easily how to create configuration? Am I understood correctly?\n2. I exposed `FUTURE_CALLBACK_THREAD_POOL_SIZE` in `VortexMasterConf.CONF`, but not enabled at the `VortexConfHelper`. I'll address it here also.\n\nIt seems an unused import was left when I rebased the branch. I'll fix it and let you know when I'm ready for the next round.

Another thing that complicates matters is the assumption of a 1:1 mapping between a message from the worker and the task that it is reporting back about. It seems like the thing to do first should be to map worker reports to multiple Tasklets before mapping a Future to multiple Tasklets.
