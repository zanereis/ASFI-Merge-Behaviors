I have a small updated the scheduler.rst to reflect the change but I didn't go into a lot details. The reason is that the document seems to me is facing Airflow users and they probly don't care too much about exactly what is happening, especially parts like how scheduler loop is divided into three logical pieces. From the existing doc, we stop at the details of DagFileProcessorManager( just mention that it would stay in sync with DAG folder but didn't go into the DagFileProcessor part), to me if we want to keep the same level of detail we should stop at briefly mention about DagFileProcessorManager and DagFileProcessorAgent level.
