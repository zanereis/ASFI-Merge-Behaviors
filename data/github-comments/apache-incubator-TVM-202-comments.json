There is rice theorem, so all solution will not be perfect, and we should do the least amount of work that get us good enough performance.\r\n2: you should just build a datastructure/helper function such as boundvar/freevar to help.

IMO this pass is especially valuable when tackling dynamic kernels in GPU which introduces a lot of branchings. It's great to see how much performance improvement we can have. For CPU, we need to make sure this pass doesn't introduce regression for some common workloads, such as resnet.\r\n\r\n@kevinthesun : I have verified the inference time for Resnet50 on CPU. There is no performance impact.
