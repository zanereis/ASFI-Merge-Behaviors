Is there a planned release coming up anytime soon?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/288993865/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/288996036","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/227#issuecomment-288996036","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/227","id":288996036,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4ODk5NjAzNg==","user":{"login":"osma","id":1132830,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzI4MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1132830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma","html_url":"https://github.com/osma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-24T11:15:00Z","updated_at":"2017-03-24T11:15:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@anujgandharv Thanks for merging master, the diffs are now much cleaner!\r\n\r\nRegarding releases: Jena doesn't have scheduled releases. Traditionally there have been about two releases per year, but recently the goal has been to have more frequent releases, with around 3 month intervals. 3.1.1 was released in November 2016 and 3.2.0 in January. Judging by that alone, a 3.3.0 release could perhaps be made in a month or so. But this depends a lot on the state of the codebase (no known serious bugs etc.) and of course volunteer effort, so no guarantees.\r\n\r\nThere are nightly Jena snapshots available from the Maven repositories, so soon after as this hits master, a 3.3.0-SNAPSHOT build can be used. You can decide for yourself whether you want to depend on that snapshot (which obviously will change quite frequently) or to maintain a local branch and use that until the 3.3.0 release.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/288996036/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/289013391","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/227#issuecomment-289013391","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/227","id":289013391,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4OTAxMzM5MQ==","user":{"login":"anujgandharv","id":1678221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzgyMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1678221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anujgandharv","html_url":"https://github.com/anujgandharv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anujgandharv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anujgandharv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anujgandharv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anujgandharv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anujgandharv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anujgandharv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anujgandharv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anujgandharv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anujgandharv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-24T12:46:20Z","updated_at":"2017-03-24T12:46:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks @osma .

I configured the entity definition to index the predicates `skos:prefLabel`, `skos:altLabel` and `skos:hiddenLabel`. The dataset has 520k triples and 29k entities. There are in total 150k triples with these label properties.\r\n\r\nI'm using a rather old laptop (i3-2330M with SSD) for the test. Ubuntu 16.04, ES 5.2.1.\r\n\r\nUsing the ES backend, indexing this dataset took about 25 minutes:\r\n```\r\n16:42:45 INFO  [1] PUT http://localhost:3030/ds/data?default\r\n17:08:06 INFO  [1] 204 No Content (1 521,465 s) \r\n```\r\n\r\nLooking at process stats, most of the time was spent by ES. It spent about 38 minutes CPU time.\r\n\r\nI also indexed the same dataset using the Lucene backend.

This allows indirect multiple writes and the more parallel write you need just load more children.\r\n\r\nThrift provides access to a dataset graph running in another JVM with full transaction support. Simplistically ​the Thrift service mimics the dataset graph interface with the addition of an ID to most calls. The ID allows the Thrift server to route the Thrift thread pool threads to the correct thread proxy to maintain thread affinity for remote transaction purposes. The iterator cache classes specifically the paged based ones cache the quads or triples to reduce round trips over the network.\r\n\r\nIf you add Thrift dataset graphs to the Mosaic you get a clustered dataset graph, i.e. multiple TDBs each running in a separate JVM which can be accessed using the standard Jena API.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/292292422/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/292294471","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/233#issuecomment-292294471","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/233","id":292294471,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MjI5NDQ3MQ==","user":{"login":"dick-twocows","id":17832706,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODMyNzA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17832706?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dick-twocows","html_url":"https://github.com/dick-twocows","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dick-twocows/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dick-twocows/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dick-twocows/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dick-twocows/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dick-twocows/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dick-twocows/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dick-twocows/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dick-twocows/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dick-twocows/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-06T19:49:37Z","updated_at":"2017-04-06T19:49:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The ability to try and begin a write transaction exists because;\r\n\r\nWe needed to run parallel loads i.e. try each child to write and the first one to return true performs the load, need more parallel spin up more tin/JVMs.\r\n\r\nThe ability to provide optimistic access, i.e. try to read, if not skip, no problem we're open world...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/292294471/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/292502682","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/227#issuecomment-292502682","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/227","id":292502682,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MjUwMjY4Mg==","user":{"login":"osma","id":1132830,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzI4MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1132830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma","html_url":"https://github.com/osma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-07T10:28:28Z","updated_at":"2017-04-07T10:28:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This PR can be closed.

For example, in a multilingual SKOS thesaurus, it's quite likely that there are `en-US` and `en-GB` labels mixed together (I know at least a couple of thesauri that do this in their SKOS files). Think about e.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\nex:zea_mays a skos:Concept ;\r\n  skos:prefLabel \"corn\"@en-US, \"maize\"@en-GB .\r\n\r\nex:coffee a skos:Concept ;\r\n  skos:prefLabel \"coffee\"@en-US, \"coffee\"@en-GB .\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow an ORDER BY that sorts primarily by language tag, then by language-specific collation rules, would order these skos:prefLabels as:\r\n\r\n1. `\"coffee\"@en-GB`\r\n1. `\"maize\"@en-GB`\r\n1. `\"coffee\"@en-US`\r\n1. `\"corn\"@en-US`\r\n\r\nI have a hard time seeing how this order would be useful to anyone. These are all English language words; as a user I don't care whether they are sorted by GB or US collation rules (even if they differed, as in fr-CA vs. fr-FR), but this is clearly worse than the current behavior which sorts first by lexical value, then by language tag.\r\n\r\nMy conclusion of this thought experiment is that there should be a way to specify the collation order in the ORDER BY statement independent of the language tags of the literals being sorted.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/293964590/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/294042634","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/237#issuecomment-294042634","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/237","id":294042634,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NDA0MjYzNA==","user":{"login":"kinow","id":304786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDc4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/304786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow","html_url":"https://github.com/kinow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-13T22:57:21Z","updated_at":"2017-04-13T22:57:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":">My conclusion of this thought experiment is that there should be a way to specify the collation order in the ORDER BY statement independent of the language tags of the literals being sorted.\r\n\r\nGood points.

I'm currently on a business trip to California and don't have time to look at this very closely, but I will do so when I have the chance.\r\n\r\nI've wanted to have something like this in jena-text some time ago, when there was no support for any other analyzers than StandardAnalyzer. However, instead of implementing a generic configuration system like this, I ended up adding support for just the easiest analyzers (e.g. SimpleAnalyzer) plus a couple I had a special need for. Others have so far done the same (e.g. MultilingualAnalyzer by Alexis Miara).\r\n\r\nIt's very good to have tests and documentation included in the PR. I'm still a bit worried about the usability aspect of this whole new configuration language. The jena-text documentation is already difficult to understand, and I've had to explain how to configure it many times to people who are new to it. Adding a new layer that allows specifying any combination of analyzers with specific parameters is very powerful, but it also adds a whole new meta-layer over an already complex configuration system.\r\n\r\n@xristy Could you elaborate a bit on why you ended up doing this (including what is the original problem you were solving), and whether you considered any alternative approaches?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/297024948/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/297027517","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/246#issuecomment-297027517","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/246","id":297027517,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NzAyNzUxNw==","user":{"login":"ajs6f","id":110994,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDk5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/110994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f","html_url":"https://github.com/ajs6f","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-25T13:20:54Z","updated_at":"2017-04-25T13:20:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I second what @osma said and I would add that there is a possible further learning challenge with this new functionality in that the two selections for test indexing, Lucene and ElasticSearch, would (after this) have even more disparate abilities.

We are developing a multilingual cultural heritage system to handle in particular Tibetan, Pali, and Sanskrit which are not handled currently among the various Lucene analyzers. There will also be instances of Chinese and other languages that are well covered among the analyzers bundled with Lucene but that are not completely exposed via the current jena-text facility.\r\n\r\nWe currently have a [Tibetan centered system](https://www.tbrc.org) (the largest repository of scanned and input Tibetan texts in the world with accompanying cultural contextual metadata) built on [eXist-db](http://exist-db.org) and are migrating to a combination of couchdb and jena. The eXist-db has a [Lucene integration](http://exist-db.org/exist/apps/doc/lucene.xml) and implements an analyzer extension feature similar to that which this PR implements for jena-text. Our current development seeks to extend the initial Tibetan analyzers to deal with a variety of issues that are peculiar to Tibetan, and to include appropriate analyzers for the additional languages that will be covered. It was thus natural for us to consider recapitulating an extension feature in the context of jena-text.\r\n\r\nOne point of interest is that much of the Tibetan data is in a variety of transliteration schemes as well as native Unicode, which is true as well of Pali for which there is really no native script but rather a historical succession of transliterations in scripts such as Thai, Burmese and so on. We currently tag various bits of content via BCP-47 conforming tags that reflect transliteration and such. This affects how analyzers are used. Further, there are differences in how we expect to treat title and name fields versus running text such as from colophons and so on.\r\n\r\nSo we are wanting to minimize the intrusion on jena (and couchdb-lucene for which we have contributed a [similar extension feature](https://github.com/rnewson/couchdb-lucene/blob/master/CONFIGURING_ANALYZERS.md)) as we develop and test a variety of analyzers for various needs.\r\n\r\nWe naturally want to be able to benefit from future developments of jena without having to incur an ongoing maintenance cost of retrofitting our extension feature or, without such feature, having to update and redeploy jena as we develop analyzers and such.\r\n\r\nThe extension feature offered in this PR seeks to decouple the use of jena from the development and configuration of analyzers. Further, having such a facility should make it easier for others to incorporate full text in their jena applications without needing to modify jena.\r\n\r\nIf PR #245 is adopted that leaves jena-text/Lucene as the default full text support and should make the case for effective configuration-based extension more compelling.\r\n\r\nI agree that the [current documentation](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/query/text-query.html) for jena-text is somewhat difficult in places to appreciate and it seems to me that some improvements there can be most helpful. I included updates to the current documentation to cover the extension and if there is interest I certainly could lend a hand to revise and extend the overall documentation to clarify the configuration and use of jena-text.\r\n\r\nYou mention the MultilingualAnalyzer by Alexis Miara and that is in fact one of the attractive features of jena that we are most eager to leverage. RDF and jena in particular via the MultilingualAnalyzer thoroughly embrace multiple languages in metadata. This PR provides a natural extension of the  MultilingualAnalyzer to include new languages as well as override the default support provided. To be clear, the eXist-db+Lucene integration provides no equivalent to the RDF convention of carrying language tagged strings throughout the framework and consequently it is difficult to handle multilingual data since it implies per language indexing of a field.\r\n\r\nI don't know whether I've dug a deeper hole or made the case plainer. I hope the latter. I realize that this PR and the associated [JENA-1326](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JENA-1326) popped up out of no where and I've tried to follow the [guidelines for contributing](https://github.com/apache/jena/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). I understand that there may be issues surrounding 3.3.0 and ES and such so I hoped to at least get this work a timely hearing in that regard. I think this PR is not in conflict with or competing with the java-text-es, but provides a useful extension to Lucene-based jena-text.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/297065423/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/297080012","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/246#issuecomment-297080012","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/246","id":297080012,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NzA4MDAxMg==","user":{"login":"osma","id":1132830,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzI4MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1132830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma","html_url":"https://github.com/osma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-25T16:05:38Z","updated_at":"2017-04-25T16:05:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@xristy Thanks for the excellent explanation about the background for this PR! As you said, this came a bit out of nowhere and it would perhaps had been easier to get oriented if you had proposed it a bit beforehand on the dev list, or filed the JIRA issue a little bit earlier, not just before the PR. But clearly this is a well prepared PR and you have done an excellent job of following the contribution guidelines, no fault with that.\r\n\r\nAs I see it, if there is a need (and you clearly have one!) for functionality like this, the code looks good, and it doesn't make ongoing maintenance more difficult, I don't see why we couldn't take it in. \r\n\r\nYour suggestion of revising the jena-text documentation would be extremely welcome. I've been concerned that it has been growing organically over time when new features have been added, but the structure has not really kept up. Also some Lucene features, such as wildcard queries, are not mentioned at all, which may have caused misunderstandings about what the text index really can do. At the minimum, linking to Lucene documentation about query syntax would help, but revising the documentation to be more tutorial-like and perhaps orienting it more around potential uses instead of individual features would help a lot. If you can give a helping hand in that, I'd appreciate it a lot!\r\n\r\nWith a rather complex extension of existing functionality like this, we would perhaps like to have some time for the code to get settled and work out emerging issues. An additional complication currently is that we are just trying to put together a release that already includes major changes to jena-text (Lucene upgrade by two major versions, partial reimplementation of the multilingual analyzer due to Lucene API changes, dropping Solr support and introducing the Elasticsearch backend), it would perhaps be safer to wait until after the release before merging this. On the other hand, I can see from the commit stats that this is basically not touching existing code at all (zero lines deleted), just adding to it, so it could be argued that this would be unlikely to break existing functionality.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/297080012/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/297108515","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/246#issuecomment-297108515","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/246","id":297108515,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NzEwODUxNQ==","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-25T17:39:50Z","updated_at":"2017-04-25T17:39:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hopefully, putting in 3.4.0 will not be too long -
