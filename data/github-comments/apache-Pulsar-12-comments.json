I think we should use the same trick on the client side. \r\n\r\nActually at zookeeper-server side, request itself contains [creation-time](https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/master/src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/server/FinalRequestProcessor.java#L89) and we can measure latency based on difference of creation-time and current time.\r\nHowever, at Zookeeper-client, request doesn’t store creation time so, client has to somehow inject creation time (may be value of “ctx” when we issue zk-command) and with aspectj we can intercept [zk-response: ClientCnxn.procesEvent()](https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/master/src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/ClientCnxn.java#L519) which has operationType and ctx=creationTime, and can measure the latency. However, we still have to make changes at broker side to make sure we pass creation-time as a “ctx” to measure the latency. Do you think that would be a better solution to measure latency at zk-client?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/307532264/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/307586136","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/468#issuecomment-307586136","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/468","id":307586136,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNzU4NjEzNg==","user":{"login":"yush1ga","id":22343413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzQzNDEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22343413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yush1ga","html_url":"https://github.com/yush1ga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yush1ga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yush1ga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yush1ga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yush1ga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yush1ga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yush1ga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yush1ga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yush1ga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yush1ga/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-10T19:42:15Z","updated_at":"2017-06-10T19:42:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"We should state the version of python, which is 2 or 3, in the document, shouldn't we ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/307586136/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/307598183","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/468#issuecomment-307598183","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/468","id":307598183,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNzU5ODE4Mw==","user":{"login":"merlimat","id":62500,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat","html_url":"https://github.com/merlimat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-11T00:30:44Z","updated_at":"2017-06-11T00:30:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@yush1ga Good point.
