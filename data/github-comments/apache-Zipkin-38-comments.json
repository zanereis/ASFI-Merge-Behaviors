Supporting Java 5 or 6 is an additional burden to contributors; it could be trivial, it could be nontrivial (I'm not sure), but things like okio/moshi only working with Java 7+ is a problem.\n\nMaintaining the fork would be on a best-effort basis, possibly driven by Zipkin users who still use Java 5/6?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/240651639/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/240671341","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/1245#issuecomment-240671341","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1245","id":240671341,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MDY3MTM0MQ==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-18T09:28:32Z","updated_at":"2016-08-18T09:28:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@eirslett so found that gson is still actively supporting java 6, so wasn't bad after using that instead of moshi.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/240671341/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/240709542","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/1245#issuecomment-240709542","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1245","id":240709542,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MDcwOTU0Mg==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-18T12:35:28Z","updated_at":"2016-08-18T12:37:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"OK.. done toying around. The new implementation uses gson instead of moshi, and a normal buffer instead of okio.\n\nI ran benchmarks before and after:\n- Thrift reads were unaffected. Thrift writes (which used to use okio), are slightly faster with small spans and the same with spans with several annotations.\n- Json reads (which now use gson instead of moshi) are 20-35% faster, but writes are about half as fast.\n\nWhile I'm sure I'll nerd out on json writes, in the future, I think this performance is fine.

(or separate ^^ into a different\nPR and keep this one alive)\n\nThought process is that we can merge having dual pull request checkers\n(existing one and now circleci). We could then carry on a separate\ndiscussion around the publish oriented things, including the more crude\ncredential tooling etc.\n\nWe didn't find travis to be a problem until time passed. My overall concern\nis quickly moving without experience in CircleCI, we end up worse than\ntravis.

Thanks for putting the effort in! Once you get to the point of having java code that does this, I can help with wiring etc to do the following if you are keen on it.\n\n---\n\nWhen we get to the point, let's put a new StorageComponent in the existing module called Cassandra3StorageComponent (or a better name). Having this in the same jar will make it easier for people to switch, and keeps the clutter down. Being in the same jar shouldn't be an issue as for example, they both use the same version of the underlying storage driver.\n\nCassandra3StorageComponent can share the lazy connection stuff etc that already exists and is tested, but employ new types Cassandra3SpanConsumer and Cassandra3SpanStore which know about the new model. This shouldn't require any forward or backward changes in the old codebase, which helps simplify this PR to only dealing with the new model (in other words, let's drop the indexing changes as there's already a PR about that.)\n\nWe can add `MigratingCassandraStorageComponent` which would write to Cassandra3SpanConsumer, but read from both the old and new impl and can share a connection for example. This would allow existing things like health checks to work simply, and also make things simple on users.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/241928574/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/241929514","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/1204#issuecomment-241929514","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1204","id":241929514,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MTkyOTUxNA==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-24T01:09:24Z","updated_at":"2016-08-24T01:09:24Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I'd prefer the changes to the old code to stay separate from adding a new model.

out...\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/242258679/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/242259806","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1254#issuecomment-242259806","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1254","id":242259806,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MjI1OTgwNg==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-25T01:49:16Z","updated_at":"2016-08-25T01:49:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Try

As long as we keep the scope to only trace ids,\nthis is a fixed overhead of how to encode the extra 64 bits.\n\nIf we go for a separate \"binary traceId128\" field, we add 26 bytes per thrift (3 /*\nfor TType.STRING field declaration _/ + 4 /_ for length prefix _/ + 16 /_ for id\n_/)\nIf we go for an additional \"i64 traceIdHigh\" field, we add 11 bytes per thrift (3\n/_ for TType.I64 field declaration _/ + 8 /_ for high bytes */)\n\nSince no-one is likely indexing on thrift offsets, traceIdHigh might not be\nas bad as I thought. Ex we could still have json just use a wider amount of\nhex characters in its traceId field.\n\nAssuming we'd need a separate index (minimally +16bytes), I'd say the\nstorage costs are spanCount \\* at least 27-42 bytes per span.\n\non the topic of TBinaryProtocol vs TCompactProtocol\nif we are looking to optimize serialized size, I'm not sure I'd use either\nsince other options are now available, and also we can rejig the model,\ntoo. So, leaving that out-of-scope for this talk.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/243950605/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/243951631","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1262#issuecomment-243951631","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1262","id":243951631,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0Mzk1MTYzMQ==","user":{"login":"jcarres-mdsol","id":1803073,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDMwNzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1803073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcarres-mdsol","html_url":"https://github.com/jcarres-mdsol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcarres-mdsol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcarres-mdsol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcarres-mdsol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcarres-mdsol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcarres-mdsol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcarres-mdsol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcarres-mdsol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcarres-mdsol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcarres-mdsol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-01T01:34:19Z","updated_at":"2016-09-01T01:34:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I do not know how realistic are the chances of clashing in a 2**64 space.
