In the *current state* of the codebase, we *need_ nb-javac*. As JDK codebase continues to evolve, newer versions of nbjavac are eventually released. Given there's *automated process* for building nb-javac out of *upstream sources*, it's rather straightforward to prepare a new build. We *are using* nbjavac to analyse user's sources AND we +- support analysis by Javac itself given the IDE runs on the \"correct\" JDK. \r\n\r\nI think we really want to ensure that \"running on correct JDK\" and \"running on possible JDK\" (that implies nb-javac to supply the targetted JDK behaviour) gives the same results, or *at least* does not fail, if the user switches nb-javac for javac (or vice-versa). From this point of view, **I fully support** integrating the PR and eventually running the tests **when a new version of nb-javac** is included. I would assume that maintainer will continue to update nbjavac as JDK team releases newer versions. While that cooperation works smothly, we can easily keep the test and benefit from it; it's in the best interest of the proponent(s) and nbjavac maintainers that nbjavac releases timely follows JDK ones.\r\n\r\nThere were several opinions voiced in the thread\r\n\r\n> @mbien:  nb-javac is optional if NB is run on the right JDK \r\n\r\nI need to remind: people who *use NetBeans* to produce code (as opposed to people *developing NetBeans*), and also people *using NetBeans as tooling platform* have very different *business* requirements that require them to run on just specific JDKs (even the IDE), and have hard requirements for the tooling platform's environment (i.e. build machines in company cluster may have some restrictions). I want to emphasize, is that it does not matter if that requirement (for those groups of our users) is 'technically sound' or not - they may exist for purely business, legal or security reasons - which may be even silly, but impossible to revert from the developer seat. \r\nIf we *require* our users to \"run on the right JDK\" - such groups of people may be forced to simply drop NetBeans completely and look for other options. If we're lucky, mandating 'just the newest JDK' will be an unneccessary PITA. We do not have that much 'spare users' that we can just throw these groups over the board just because it makes NetBeans development more pleasant. Oracle's Graal/Cloud team may be also affected by such approach.\r\n\r\nSo the assumption that 'everyone can use any JDK' so NB \"runs on the correct JDK\" is IMHO wrong. I feel that the discussion emphasizes the importance of development \"our common pet project\" (Apache NetBeans) too much and optimizes for it, while deprioritizing our *users*. I happen to be \r\n- NetBeans IDE developer, \r\n- NetBeans IDE-based application developer: the Apache NB language server, for example, but also the IdealGraphVisualizer from Graal is based on NetBeans IDE *including* java support\r\n- NetBeans platform - based application developer (my incubating personal project). \r\nEven as IGV maintainer, I often needed to compile+patch NB platform to trace bugs, or even develop patches or small features for NB in order to make my *real* project successful -- I do that routinely with maven and gradle (while developing NetBeans). In all situations, having the *flexibility* to work with development environment dictated by my business, rather than \"obey NetBeans dictate\" is very helpful and makes dev's life a lot easier as there are other pieces included with their own limitations. I will cover this in a separate discussion related to \"drop JDK8\".\r\n\r\nI believe that maintaining a bundled, well-tested compiler is a benefit for those user groups with \"strange requirements\" - as long as the nb-javac keeps releasing updated versions after its upstream releases. Now it does, so we should act accordingly. At the same time, we can just plan for an exit strategy, which may be fairly simple. We do not need to play what-if games *now* to block a thing that would, for example, alert us when a problematic change happens in some future JDK javac version.\r\n \r\n>> @jlahoda : One advantage of having a firm compiler during build is less dependence on specifics of the compile-time JDK. \r\n\r\n> @matthiasblaesing:  I think this is an academic discussion. If we can't build with the current JDK, it is a bug that must be fixed.\r\n\r\nI don't think this is not an academic discussion: I agree that when we detect that our codebase is not compilable with new JDK, we should address that SOON. But I do not see that as a valid argument for or against the discussed change, rather as an unrelated test and policy that we should establish anyway. As jlahoda noted, usage of \"most updated\" but bundled javac *allows* modern optional modules to be written when the author decides he does not need (want) to support older JDKs. In particular modules that require e.g. JDK17 APIs to run. Doing so *without* nb-javac would require everyone working on NB codebase to upgrade to JDK17 ... which is not an option (see above).\r\n\r\n> @mbien : I do fear that this PR here is just bootstrapping the option for a future switch to frgaal with the argument\r\n\r\nIt might. But a 'fear that something might happen' should not cause to block a change just because \"it might be extended in the future, maybe\". You/we should be aware of such extension may happen. Rejecting a purely 'piecemeal' approach is a valid position, if it is the (only/major) supportive \"argument\" if such  proposal comes in the future.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1476890956/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1476903128","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/5617#issuecomment-1476903128","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5617","id":1476903128,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5YB8DY","user":{"login":"neilcsmith-net","id":3975960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3975960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net","html_url":"https://github.com/neilcsmith-net","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-20T20:41:37Z","updated_at":"2023-03-20T20:41:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@lkishalmi well, we've always used merge commits.

clarify what this PR is supposed to achieve and how it benefits the project. PRs are supposed to improve the project.\r\n\r\nif this intends to actually test nb-javac:\r\n - I would tend to agree with @dbalek + @jlahoda  and say it is ok to add a few lines to the ant task if they make it easier for the nb-javac project to run CI tests which compile NetBeans there. I am still not happy about it, since this locks every single module into using the same task in future, which should not be a requirement, since javac works just fine (and a search will show you it is still used).\r\n - I still don't know why nb-javac has to build NetBeans as a test case, it can be literally any other project and doing this via a gradle/maven plugin has actually practical use cases, since those things are still used IRL in contrast to ant\r\n\r\nThis is however is not what I see in this PR! This PR adds a CI workflow. If nb-javac stages a new build It makes absolutely no sense to test it here, check if NB builds and if not, fix something in nb-javac which is a completely different project. The NetBeans project is also not running maven tests here to check if something fails before upgrading maven - this already happened!\r\n\r\nRegarding reproducible builds: \r\n1) I don't see anything indicating that anyone wants to work on this. Interest in CI topics is in general fairly low, as long CI works, nobody cares about it. (and I completely understand, since it is just a tool and a solved problem). Why do I think that would be the case? I migrated travis to gh and the feedback threads I opened on the dev list are basically empty, I almost merged some of the PRs without being able to motivate anyone to approve them (only the usual suspects took a look (thanks again)), and yes I usually added [everyone](4431). Again: as long the build works nobody cares\r\n2) reproducible builds in java do not require to separate the compiler from the JDK, I have helped with reproducible builds before in other projects and that wasn't even on the table there. The JDK is a convenient bundle you can depend on - its a feature not a bug\r\n3) trying to achieve reproducible builds with ~450 ant projects going to be hell.\r\n\r\n> It might. But a 'fear that something might happen' should not cause to block a change just because \"it might be extended in the future, maybe\"\r\n\r\n@sdedic I disagree. If there is no clear benefit to the project in the first place, it should be enough of a reason to not merge something (we have done that before). The argument to merge it is the exact same. Someone might find it potentially useful in hypothetical reproducible builds some time in future, just in case someone wanted to swap out a compiler. Again: if this is about a test case for nb-javac -> wrong repository.\r\n\r\nregarding JDK 8:\r\n\r\n[It's dead Jim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MH7KYmGnj40). For those who haven't migrated yet: maven central is full with NB versions which still support it (and there will be a few more, I am sure). If someone wants to participate, please do so and I am sure we will find a way to branch NB (assuming everyone agrees and we find a release manager) - lets get involved if you have specific requirements - now is the time.\r\n\r\nnb-javac does not backport the java ecosystem to JDK 8\r\n\r\nI have never been in or heard of a team who didn't allow intellij or android studio because it uses JDK 17 to run on (it wouldn't surprise me at all if they move to 21 shortly after it lands). No matter what the support contracts were. I am sure they exist somewhere but I don't think we have to take them into account in the minimum requirements (again: get involved).\r\n\r\nyes this absolutely should have been discussed on the dev list, like I wrote in the first comment of this PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1477897301/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1478354216","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/5694#issuecomment-1478354216","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5694","id":1478354216,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5YHeUo","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-21T17:59:12Z","updated_at":"2023-03-21T17:59:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The first two commits are identical to #5677 and that PR should be merged first.\r\n\r\nSpecial attention is advised for the commits f17e17d, 0b818e0 and e7a40ce.

The current code that is proposed to be integrated here has already an outside history, ontop of your work. I looked into the divergence between the upstream graaljs and the version you thankfully created and faced to much for me to handle. So I created my own fork (https://github.com/matthiasblaesing/graaljs-nb) and modified the parser in a manor I could manage to support new JS features. This was also motivated by the fact, that graaljs upstream does not support JSX and thus a move fully to upstream would kill that feature in NetBeans.\r\n\r\nWe can try to get the fork more in-line with upstream again and reduce differences, but I don't see us switching back to upstream again.

I had some suggestions/thoughts that address my technical points and might also partially address @mbien concerns:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/matthiasblaesing/netbeans/tree/BuildNetBeansWithNbJavac\r\n\r\nThe branch was rebased onto master to fix the merge conflicts. Changes:\r\n\r\n- b4eaeaa6bcad8a4df17c9cc3db9f5311f98764f9: `loadClass` is not synchronized and does not synchronize access to the caching `HashMap`. Instead of introducing synchronization, use a thread safe `ConcurrentHashMap`.\r\n- a655b626ce1ad1569953e882ec68e40826876b1e: Don't kill `-Werror`, instead only suppress the warnings created by the broken `ct.sym` files. A comment was added documenting, that this workaround has to be removed, once the next nbjavac release is there.\r\n- 34902ef592bee4b0d1bb5bea2b9e55259e0d13d9: Add information about the usecase of this approach and the limits it poses.\r\n- 623a396c8ed341834d080eb7f4a1d2aa487e6b87: Only run the nbjavac test job when the `nb-javac` label is added to the PR. This is in line with other long running/additional java jobs, that should not be run everytime a change is made somewhere in the codebase\r\n\r\n@jtulach could you please have a look at this? Feel free to use the branch or cherry pick the additional commits.\r\n\r\n@mbien could you check if that addresses some of you concerns? We can discuss whether nbjavac is really a good idea, but at this point in time it is an integral part of the core of Java editing in NetBeans and I think it might help catching bugs.\r\n\r\nEdited: Updated the final commit and switch label from `Java` to `nb-javac`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1484133563/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1484135318","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/5694#issuecomment-1484135318","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5694","id":1484135318,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5YdhuW","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-26T15:41:08Z","updated_at":"2023-03-26T15:41:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jtulach for the \"Can it be integrated?\" question: The ASF 3rd party license policy lists the `UPL` as Category-A (\"For inclusion in an Apache Software Foundation product, we consider the following licenses to be similar in terms to the Apache License 2.0\") https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a).\r\n\r\nI'd like to integrate as is, do you object or is it ok from your perspective?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1484135318/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
