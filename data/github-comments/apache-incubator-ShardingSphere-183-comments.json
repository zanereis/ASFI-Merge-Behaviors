Just a naming strategy suggestion.\r\n\r\nMy project is in this structure:\r\n|-RootProject\r\n  \\-CommonModule\r\n  \\-ServiceModule1\r\n  \\-ServiceModule2\r\n\r\nServiceModules are all referencing the CommonModule, so that I can extract some common configurations to avoid redundant code.\r\nThen I also need to write some tests in each module, so I have excluded the auto-configuration classes for features in Common, then import back in ServiceModules. This can start spring and run tests without configuration properties declared in the yaml file.\r\n\r\nFor other AutoConfiguration classes from the features I used, they are naming like:\r\nSecurityAutoConfiguration.class,\r\nDruidDataSourceAutoConfigure.class,\r\nDataSourceAutoConfiguration.class,\r\nRabbitAutoConfiguration.class\r\n\r\nSo here I suggest renaming the sharding sphere data source auto-configuration boot class to avoid confusions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/774846438/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/774865450","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/9363#issuecomment-774865450","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/9363","id":774865450,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3NDg2NTQ1MA==","user":{"login":"tristaZero","id":27757146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NzU3MTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27757146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero","html_url":"https://github.com/tristaZero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-08T04:57:42Z","updated_at":"2021-02-08T04:57:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi, \r\n\r\nCould you do some search on `getGeneratedKeys()` by Springboot?\r\nSpringboot just helps users manage the data sources, and I guess there is some interface calling `getGeneratedKeys()` of `preparedStatement` to return all the generated keys. \r\nSuppose you want to try the original `getGeneratedKeys()` of `preparedStatement`, you can write a demo to call this function from `ShardingSphereDataSource`. \r\n\r\nThat way will help us figure out whether SS has a bug on this function or just a usage issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/774865450/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/774868520","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/9356#issuecomment-774868520","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/9356","id":774868520,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3NDg2ODUyMA==","user":{"login":"tristaZero","id":27757146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NzU3MTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27757146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero","html_url":"https://github.com/tristaZero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-08T05:05:53Z","updated_at":"2021-02-08T05:05:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @huosenyuan ,\r\n\r\n> List<QueryResult> queryResults = executeQuery0(); has result; after The result set in statement has been cleared；\r\n\r\nThanks for feedback.\r\nWho did clear this `List<QueryResult>`?
