hbase-qualifier by Options, and the hbase-key is composed by all the keys by multiPut's List<Object> keys.<br/>\n    for example, If I have stream with <deal_id, date, pv>, grouped by <deal_id, date>, then, the hbase-key is composed by<deal_id, date>, the hbase-qualifier is pv.<br/>\n    But when I want hbase-key is deal_id, and hbase-qualifier is pv+date, HBaseMapState can not support this.<br/>\n    ==================================================================================<br/>\n    With this patch, user can customize the hbase-key & hbase-qualifier by interface TridentHBaseMapMapper. </p>\n\n<p>    As a old user, can use the old style like this:<br/>\n    HBaseMapState.Options hbaseOptions = new HBaseMapState.Options();<br/>\n    hbaseOptions.mapMapper = new
