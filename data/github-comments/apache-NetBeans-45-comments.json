Using a plain Icon allows you to switch implementations under the hood without affecting the users.\r\n\r\nUsing an image for an icon is trivial, but an Icon could be drawn by java code or could be backed by an SVG that is scaled and rendered at the right size.\r\n\r\nI had a quick look at this and it seems, that the problem can be tracked down into `org.netbeans.spi.editor.completion.support.CompletionUtilities#renderHtml` that method expects an `ImageIcon`. So to remove the requirement, the whole chain from `editor.completion` to the groovy editor would need to be fixed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/531182362/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/531192084","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1497#issuecomment-531192084","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/1497","id":531192084,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMTE5MjA4NA==","user":{"login":"eirikbakke","id":886243,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NjI0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/886243?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke","html_url":"https://github.com/eirikbakke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-13T10:51:30Z","updated_at":"2019-09-13T10:51:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The patch looks fine.
