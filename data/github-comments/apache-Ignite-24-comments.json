I've fixed most of them, the biggest changes are:\r\n1. Rework of hierarchies: IndexRow, IndexKey;\r\n2. Hide packages from public to internal;\r\n3. Restore backward compatibility for POJO type;\r\n4. Replace Schema with RowHandler;\r\n5. Introduce interfaces for date/time keys and delegates implementations to H2 (as it contains a lot of custom H2 logic, and license of h2 does not allow use this code, only in binary form).\r\n\r\nFor most of other comments I provide fixes, comment them and resolve issues. Some of issues are not resolved to just clearify that my fix is correct.\r\n\r\nThe only things to finalize:\r\n1. Cursor implementations can't be implemented other way as H2 (\"select max(col) from table\" query) depends on the logic that it invokes get() before next(). Currently I see a single way - put a comment there and fix with Calcite integration.\r\n2. MVCC tests, including C++ mvcc test, can I just remove all of them?\r\n3. If design is OK, then I will run performance tests.\r\n\r\nCould you please review my PR again?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/comments/790029287/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/comments/792561267","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ignite/pull/8820#issuecomment-792561267","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/8820","id":792561267,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5MjU2MTI2Nw==","user":{"login":"atris","id":1724131,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjQxMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1724131?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/atris","html_url":"https://github.com/atris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-08T08:09:19Z","updated_at":"2021-03-08T08:09:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @vkulichenko.

Thanks for the review. I've fixed all your comments. Some details:\r\n1. IndexName now is not Serializable. So I think there won't be any compatibility issues.\r\n2. IgniteIndexing now is IndexProcessor. I reverted all changes in IndexSpi.\r\n3. I added SignedBytesIndexKey to simplify the signature of the IndexKey.compare method.\r\n4. I reviewed all deleted or ignored tests and found 2 that was ignored incorrectly (they test clean index tree task). Restored them.\r\n5. The only entrypoint for index rows comparison is the `InlineIndexTree.compare` method. So I think it's OK that parts of the comparison mechanism are splitted between different classes, as all of them are used in single place.\r\n6. Performance test is OK, no degradation for sql queries.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/comments/801145914/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/comments/801765328","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ignite/pull/8867#issuecomment-801765328","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/8867","id":801765328,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwMTc2NTMyOA==","user":{"login":"ptupitsyn","id":10922892,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTIyODky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10922892?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptupitsyn","html_url":"https://github.com/ptupitsyn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptupitsyn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptupitsyn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptupitsyn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptupitsyn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptupitsyn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptupitsyn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptupitsyn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptupitsyn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptupitsyn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-18T09:22:17Z","updated_at":"2021-03-18T09:24:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Summarizing our private discussion with @nizhikov :\r\n\r\n**Problem**\r\nService arguments are deserialized \"in the middle\" when pass `Object[] args` around in `GridServiceProxy`:\r\n* This causes array element type info loss\r\n* This is totally unnecessary and reduces performance\r\n\r\n**Possible fix**\r\nDo not perform unnecessary argument des/ser, retain original binary representation along the call chain.\r\nE.g. for .NET -> .NET service call, the bytes are written on .NET side on one node will be received exactly as is on .NET side on another node.\r\n\r\nThis can be achieved by wrapping the arguments in some way - `byte[]` or `BinaryObject`, and passing this around instead of `Object[]`.

@nizhikov \r\nQuery plan contains table names and fields which are part of the schema. Schema could be treated as sensitive. Data is most important and is a compromise target for attackers. Schema is at best an information leak.\r\n\r\nThat said, databases themselves typically treat schema metadata at a different and higher privilege level than the data, not without reason. Schema provides attackers with useful hints. And a user with privileges to see schema can almost always see data, while users with privileges to see data may not be able to see schema.\r\n\r\nSo schema should not be considered unnecessary to protect.
