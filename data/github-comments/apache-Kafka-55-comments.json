Eventually we will have our own wrapper ZK client around the raw ZK client. \n\nWe can either have a big patch that replace all the current ZK usage with our wrapper client based on raw ZK Client in one shot, or we can do it gradually in multiple patches. In this patch, I am taking the second approach, it seems a reasonable and relatively smooth way for migration. And I think it also solves KAFKA-3083.\n\nIn this patch I introduced our own wrapper client. It is currently extending the org.I0Itec.zkclient.ZkClient. So that we can get the protected raw ZK client in side it. That means we are essentially dealing with a raw ZK client in our own wrapper when we do async read and write. I noticed that actually Apache Helix is using this similar approach.\n\nThe good things about this approach are that:\n1. There is no duplicate efforts compared with the final state. We are essentially writing our own ZK wrapper around raw ZK Client. We will add more and more methods to our own wrapper to replace the methods in org.I0Itec.zkclient.ZkClient.\n2. We don't need to introduce two ZK client at the same time.\n3. It is low risk and more smooth for migration. We can add more and more methods in our ZK client wrapper based on the raw ZK client. Once we no longer call any methods from org.I0Itec.zkclient.ZkClient, we remove it from Kafka completely.\n\nThat said, I am also fine if we want to have a big patch to replace everything in one shot.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/204078953/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/204121243","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1149#issuecomment-204121243","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1149","id":204121243,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNDEyMTI0Mw==","user":{"login":"fpj","id":572920,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjkyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/572920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpj","html_url":"https://github.com/fpj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-31T20:49:20Z","updated_at":"2016-03-31T20:49:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@becketqin I was thinking of an approach in which we don't change the signatures of methods in `ZkUtils` but reimplement them to use async calls directly to the raw zk handle.

Reworking the zkUtils would be great. It is just in that case we probably still need to handle all the re-connection by ourselves. Which might have some similar logic as ZKClient is currently doing. \n\nAfter taking a closer look at the ZkClient code and our code, I feel exactly the same thing as you mentioned: zkClient is a convenient client except it re-connects **_silently**_ on session expiration / disconnection. I am trying to see if we can work around this issue but still keep the useful features which are something we probably also have to write even if we use raw ZK client, e.g re-connect, listeners, etc.\n\nThat is why I added this `withCurrentSession` method to zkUtils which guarantees us some session-bound state when we update ZK paths. The current PR only uses it for asynchronous ZK path update, but it is pretty trivial to also use it for synchronous updates as well. \n\nI think this is a simple and quick solution to the issues we have seen so far, KAFKA-3083, KAFKA-3038 as well as this ticket. Most importantly, this patch does not introduce any duplicate work to KAFKA-3210. All the rework in zkUtils can still be done. It will give us the freedom to either continue to add more methods to our own ZK clients without blocking anything or we can re-evaluate and see whether that is still needed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/204166948/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/204170812","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1139#issuecomment-204170812","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1139","id":204170812,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNDE3MDgxMg==","user":{"login":"hachikuji","id":12502538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAyNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12502538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji","html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-31T23:21:04Z","updated_at":"2016-03-31T23:21:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Ishiihara I had a couple minor questions, but this seems reasonable to me.

Here are a few points:\n- We need a mechanism to inform all parts of the code that need to know about it, listeners make sense although we need to be careful with the order of delivery. The zookeeper client guarantees order, I can't remember now if ZkClient respects it, although if I recall correctly, they use a separate thread to deliver events.\n- We need to make sure to fail all pending operations rather than transparently create a new session and retry. This is fairly different from how ZkClient does it today.\n- When a session expires, we need to create a new session for liveness, unless we decide to shutdown the broker and restart it with a watchdog or manually, which I'm under the impression we don't want to do. However, we can only re-create the session once we are sure that no operation is going to spill from the old session to the next. We need to block the session creation until we have confirmation from the broker that we can proceed. This is fairly different as well.\n- I'd like to support the asynchronous api because it gives us a speed advantage, and ZkClient doesn't currently support it as you have observed. ZkClient could be changed to support the asynchronous api, but it would require a few changes.\n\n> That is why I added this withCurrentSession method to zkUtils which guarantees us some session-bound state when we update ZK paths.\n\nSounds like a good thing to do, but it doesn't completely get rid of races. I can start a zk request at the exact moment I create a new session, so logically I'm in the old session but the request will be executed in the new because the current session is the latest one created. \n\n> this patch does not introduce any duplicate work to KAFKA-3210\n\nIt duplicates in the sense that we were proposing to introduce asynchronous api in a systematic manner rather than sprinkle it across the code. Our concern is that it could become even harder to manage the interaction with zookeeper if we start using different approaches across the code.\n\nLet me have a closer look at your proposal and get back to you, I want to think a bit more about your proposal and its impact longer term.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/204302045/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/204323526","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1171#issuecomment-204323526","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1171","id":204323526,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNDMyMzUyNg==","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-01T09:15:55Z","updated_at":"2016-04-01T09:15:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@fpj maybe you could take a look\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/204323526/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/204413578","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1121#issuecomment-204413578","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1121","id":204413578,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNDQxMzU3OA==","user":{"login":"granthenke","id":1928566,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Mjg1NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1928566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke","html_url":"https://github.com/granthenke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-01T14:17:44Z","updated_at":"2016-04-01T14:17:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@ijuma It looks like this is a regression in Intellij that is exposed when 2 modules point to the same source.

A necessary condition for success is that the collection of tests picked up should match between branches:\n\n```\ncd kafka\nducktape tests/ --collect-only  # compare (apache/kafka) trunk vs your branch\n\n# you may want to clean out .pyc files etc when you move stuff around:\n# find . | grep -E \"(__pycache__|\\.pyc$)\" | xargs rm -rf\n```\n\nWhen I try this in your branch, I only pick up 62 tests out of ~160. This is most likely caused the broken imports I mentioned.\n\nOnce imports are fixed, we can run the tests in branch builder to make sure that tests can still pick up the templates they need. The layout looks right, but it will be good to validate this.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/204484986/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/204486458","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1162#issuecomment-204486458","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1162","id":204486458,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNDQ4NjQ1OA==","user":{"login":"granthenke","id":1928566,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Mjg1NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1928566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke","html_url":"https://github.com/granthenke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-01T17:45:59Z","updated_at":"2016-04-01T17:45:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@granders Thanks for the review!

I think we are totally on the same page and I believe this patch follows exactly what you suggested.\n\nThe async write / read directly uses the raw ZooKeeper client. It does not depend on any ZkClient functions. The only difference is that instead of creating a separate raw ZooKeeper client, it use the ZooKeeper client wrapped inside ZkClient. This is necessary because we don't want to have two ZooKeeper connections. This patch is actually surprisingly small (I pasted later).\n\n> Sounds like a good thing to do, but it doesn't completely get rid of races. I can start a zk request at the exact moment I create a new session, so logically I'm in the old session but the request will be executed in the new because the current session is the latest one created.\n\nThe way withCurrentSession works is:\n1. cache the current raw ZooKeeper object.\n2. check if the pre-condition is met (e.g. is this broker still controller)\n3. use the cached ZooKeeper object taken in step 1 to perform the ZooKeeper update.\nZkClient might re-create the session at any point.\nIf re-connection / expiration happened before step 1, the update should not see any exception.\nIf re-connection / expiration happened after step 1, step 3 will see exception, because the cached ZooKeeper object has already disconnected from the server or its session has already expired. In this case, we propagate the exception to the upper layer to handle. (In this patch, the upper layer will retry the operation with the new session. The pre-condition will be checked again on the new session, of course.\nNot sure if I missed something, but it seems in any case we will not silently use a newly re-created connection without validating the pre-condition on that connection.\n\n```\n  // With current session\n  def withCurrentSession(preconditionChecker: Option[() => Boolean] = None)(f: ZooKeeper => Unit) {\n    val currentZk = zkClient.currentZk\n    if (!preconditionChecker.fold(true)(f => f()))\n      throw new IllegalStateException(\"The pre-check failed.\")\n    f(currentZk)\n  }\n```\n\n> We need a mechanism to inform all parts of the code that need to know about it, listeners make sense although we need to be careful with the order of delivery. The zookeeper client guarantees order, I can't remember now if ZkClient respects it, although if I recall correctly, they use a separate thread to deliver events.\n> When a session expires, we need to create a new session for liveness, unless we decide to shutdown the broker and restart it with a watchdog or manually, which I'm under the impression we don't want to do. However, we can only re-create the session once we are sure that no operation is going to spill from the old session to the next. We need to block the session creation until we have confirmation from the broker that we can proceed. This is fairly different as well.\n> We need to make sure to fail all pending operations rather than transparently create a new session and retry. This is fairly different from how ZkClient does it today.\n\nAlthough ZkClient can recreate session transparently, as mentioned in `withCurrentSession`,  we will not silently use the re-created session without validating the pre-condition on that session. Exception will be propagated to let the upper layer to handle in that case. So it looks we don't need to worry about ZkClient implementation. \n\n> It duplicates in the sense that we were proposing to introduce asynchronous api in a systematic manner rather than sprinkle it across the code. Our concern is that it could become even harder to manage the interaction with zookeeper if we start using different approaches across the code.\n\nThe async writes and reads introduced in this patch is intended for general ZooKeeper read / write purpose directly depends on raw ZooKeeper client. In fact this part of the code are literally 30 lines. These code can be used to replace all the current zookeeper usage across the board.\n\n```\n  private[kafka] class ZkClient(zkConnection: IZkConnection, connectionTimeout: Int, zkSerializer: ZkSerializer)\n  extends org.I0Itec.zkclient.ZkClient(zkConnection, connectionTimeout, zkSerializer) {\n\n  def asyncWriteDataAndReturnStat(path: String,\n                                  datat: String,\n                                  callbackWithData: StatCallback,\n                                  expectedVersion: Int,\n                                  zkOpt: Option[ZooKeeper] = None) = {\n    val data: Array[Byte] = ZKStringSerializer.serialize(datat)\n    var zk = zkOpt.getOrElse(currentZk)\n    zk.setData(path, data, expectedVersion, callbackWithData, null)\n  }\n\n  def asyncReadData(path: String, callback: DataCallback) {\n    retryUntilConnected(new Callable[Object] {\n      def call: Object = {\n        currentZk.getData(path, false, callback, null)\n        null\n      }\n    })\n  }\n\n  def currentZk = _connection.asInstanceOf[ZkConnection].getZookeeper\n}\n```\n\nI don't have a strong opinion on whether we should replace all the zk read / write with asynch version in one shot or not. That is not a bad idea. \nAt a high level, there are two jobs needs to be done:\n1. Introduce the async ZK read / write primitives that does not naively use a new session silently.\n2. Use the primitives in (1) to replace the current ZK usage.\n\nWe can \n**a)** do both (1) and (2) in one patch; or \n**b)** do (1) in a patch then (2) in another patch; or \n**c)** do (1) in one patch and (2) in several patches. \nThis patch is taking approach **c)**. It did (1) and a part of (2), and will migrate other ZK usages to use async ZK read / write in other patches.\nSo this patch does not seem to be duplicate efforts compared to the end state. It is just walking at a different pace.\n*_The real question to be answered for this patch is that whether the above code snippet solves our concern with ZkClient or not. *_\nIf it does, I think this patch gives us the freedom either continuing developing based on raw ZooKeeper client or just leave it as it is until we see compelling reason to do that.\n\nI don't oppose to take approach **a)** in this patch if people think it is better, although personally I don't see much value to re-write the other functions in ZkClient which we don't have problem with.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/204516270/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/204520791","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1175#issuecomment-204520791","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1175","id":204520791,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNDUyMDc5MQ==","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-01T18:52:14Z","updated_at":"2016-04-01T18:52:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ymatsuda

It fixes the problem with failures during handshake, but I wasn't sure if there was a reason why unsent requests had to be cleared on every iteration. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/205215265/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/205220982","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1181#issuecomment-205220982","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1181","id":205220982,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNTIyMDk4Mg==","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-04T09:54:25Z","updated_at":"2016-04-04T09:54:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"For trivial fixes like this, it's fine to include in other PRs like #1180 by the way.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/205220982/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/205237971","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1181#issuecomment-205237971","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1181","id":205237971,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNTIzNzk3MQ==","user":{"login":"mjsax","id":8959638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NTk2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8959638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax","html_url":"https://github.com/mjsax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-04T10:45:58Z","updated_at":"2016-04-04T10:45:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks @ijuma.

To use new producer against a secure Kafka installation, user will have to specify security configs in producer.config file. Irrespective of whether we want to hide producer from user or not, another question is that if it is OK to remove old producer from one tool while keeping it in other tools? Maybe we should keep it around till we completely remove old-producer?
