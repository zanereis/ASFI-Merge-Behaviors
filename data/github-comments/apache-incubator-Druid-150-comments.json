Index task is a general task type that can be used for ingesting data from any dataSource even including druid's other dataSources. So, using index tasks, you can add new dataSources by ingesting external data to druid or reindex existing dataSources (http://druid.io/docs/latest/ingestion/update-existing-data.html). Here, the later is able to be used for the compaction effectively because index tasks can automatically determine more optmized shardSpec and segment size (please refer to [here](https://github.com/jihoonson/druid/blob/f85f17d66ab01da030012e0e1366d079a9056a9f/docs/content/design/index.md#roll-up-modes) for more details.) Meanwhile, merge tasks are capable of merging existing segments which have none shardSpec.\r\n2. I recommend to use Hadoop index task for now because the native index task has some limitations like the potential out of disk problem (https://github.com/druid-io/druid/issues/4227) and slow ingestion due to the single processing model. This will be resolved in 0.11.0.\r\n3. Unfortunately, it's not possible because of the limitation of our current segment versioning system. If you run a compaction task and a kafka index task at the same time, one of their result segments will be overshadowed and eventually removed. Please refer to https://github.com/druid-io/druid/issues/4479 for more details.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/312762496/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/312762612","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/4499#issuecomment-312762612","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4499","id":312762612,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMjc2MjYxMg==","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-04T02:01:12Z","updated_at":"2017-07-04T02:01:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/312762612/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/312774029","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/4498#issuecomment-312774029","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4498","id":312774029,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMjc3NDAyOQ==","user":{"login":"erankor","id":4777488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Nzc0ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4777488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erankor","html_url":"https://github.com/erankor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erankor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erankor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erankor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erankor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erankor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erankor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erankor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erankor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erankor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-04T03:50:34Z","updated_at":"2017-07-04T03:50:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@jihoonson, thank you very much for your support!
