contains like source component id, source task id, etc. This means that even if I emit a null the payload can not be

there is a performance hit. Especially in a single node cluster (don't know if you were running multiple workers), and networking doesn't come into play . I'm thinking of the big picture where you have multiple nodes. Then the numbers change, and it's not that big a hit.\n\nIf we release with what we have now, I would leave things as is, and document that there's a performance benefit to turning it off. It's not hard to twiddle that flag.\n\nIf we release as is, with this patch, the ui won't work as expected. Users will be confused, and anyone in a support role (I.e. Us) will be barraged with questions.
