going to close this PR because I don't think it is an approach that makes sense for the Iceberg project.\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons why Iceberg exists is because it is important to solve problems in the right place. Before, we needed to solve problems in the processing engine or in a file format, and those created awkward, half-baked solutions. Similarly, I think that this is not the right place or a good approach for optimization.\r\n\r\nFirst, the ideal approach is to write data correctly in the first place. That's why Iceberg defines table-level tuning settings and write order, and why we request distribution and ordering in engines like Spark. We want to be able to asynchronously optimize tables, but we don't want to require it if we don't need to. Focusing effort on fixing the underlying problem (creating too many files) is a better approach. I think we should see if we can address the problem in the write path by coalescing outputs and aligning write distribution with table partitioning.\r\n\r\nSecond, kicking off a job in a specific downstream job through an API intended to collect metrics is not a good design for asynchronous optimization. Quite a few comments question aspects of this. Those are valid concerns. But ignoring the specifics, I think that the choices here were made because this is attempting to solve a problem in the wrong place. Rather than going that direction and then getting pulled deeper into a mess -- adding more compute options or rules for how to take action -- I think the right approach is to have APIs that enable people to build optimizers, similar to how we handle catalogs. That's why we built metrics reporting as an API: to get important information to downstream systems.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1519124565/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1519130533","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/7415#issuecomment-1519130533","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/7415","id":1519130533,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85ajBel","user":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-23T18:47:36Z","updated_at":"2023-04-23T18:47:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@lurnagao thanks for reporting.

and an enumeration partition field, we have about 70 enumeration partitions, of which two enumerations account for more than 70% of the total, so the current iceberg write mode certainly cannot meet our requirements.

It supports read/write with Spark and Flink.

We are happy to explore how to make it work with Iceberg REST client. Please let me know if you have any use cases.\r\n\r\nBigLake Metastore works with PyIceberg, we have a Python client: https://cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/biglake/latest.

Regarding the 4x slowdown, this is indeed a four-fold decrease in throughput.

Regarding the custom range partitioner, I implemented a custom range partitioner myself. As described in my previous reply, we will specify the proportion of each enumeration partition to the total data volume before the task starts (distribution-balance-column- ratio), and then use the custom range partitioner to calculate which streamWrite subtasks the data of each enumeration type is distributed to. According to #6382 and #7269, I then realized the dynamic adjustment of the total data of each enumeration partition based on each checkpoint statistics The proportion of volume(distribution-balance-column- ratio), so as to achieve the purpose of dynamic allocation, from the metric on the Flink ui, my data shuffling is very uniform, from the monitoring point of view, the cpu occupancy rate of all my tm is 100%, the following two pictures These are some of my monitoring data at this time\r\n<img width=\"623\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40817998/234160124-aeb88a2d-953c-45be-a299-fc5fb4189c78.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1093\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40817998/234160387-baeaddcd-1697-4b5d-9d0c-22ba8a915257.png\">\r\n3.
