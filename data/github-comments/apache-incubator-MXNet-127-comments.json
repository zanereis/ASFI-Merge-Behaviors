Which is already how it worked before -- that's what `0` did, for example -- it copied the corresponding dim from the input dims to the output dims.\n\nNow it gets some more operations, like taking two input dims and only emitting one output dim, or taking one input dim and emitting two output dims. That way the rank of your output can be different from the rank of your input, but the way it chooses the dimensions is guaranteed to be valid as long as the rest of the spec is also valid.\n\nSo if you just imagine this little machine walking along the input dims and writing to the output dims it's quite easy to 'read' the instructions in your head. My existing addition to the description of 'shape' explains the math of this precisely, but a more intuitive explanation would also be useful.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/259816708/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/259821717","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/3781#issuecomment-259821717","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/3781","id":259821717,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1OTgyMTcxNw==","user":{"login":"piiswrong","id":568948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODk0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong","html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-10T22:06:49Z","updated_at":"2016-11-10T22:06:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think examples should go reshape.cc in describe\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/259821717/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/259843444","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/3781#issuecomment-259843444","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/3781","id":259843444,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1OTg0MzQ0NA==","user":{"login":"taliesinb","id":365157,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTE1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/365157?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/taliesinb","html_url":"https://github.com/taliesinb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taliesinb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taliesinb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taliesinb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taliesinb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taliesinb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taliesinb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taliesinb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taliesinb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taliesinb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-10T23:56:45Z","updated_at":"2016-11-10T23:56:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@piiswrong Ok I added examples for each code.

Your syntax `(-4, seqlen, -2)` would require a special case, the two 'arguments' to Split2 currently have to be ordinary positive integers (although ONE of them can be -1, to mean that it is equal to the original input length divided by the other integer). \n\nI can add that case for `-2`, but to me it only really makes sense in the second position to Split2, like what you wrote. The other way round, `(-4, -2, seqlen)`, would 'mix up' the higher dimensions in a weird non-local way. Do any of other codes make sense as arguments to Split2? Let's think. `0` would just copy the input dimension you're splitting, so the other dimension would be forced to be `1`. That's pretty useless. `-3` and `-4` seem pretty complicated to support and I'm trying to think what kind of interpretation these have. \n\nSo maybe I can summarize these thoughts as: I've defined a machine that operates on stacks of dimensions and pops and pushes them according to the target spec ('the instructions'). This machine is useful because it lets us write simple 'programs' that decide the output shape and they work against many input shapes in a uniform way. This is good because we don't need to have say 3 or 4 new kinds of layers that hard-code these behaviors when a flexible spec can give us the same thing. \n\nBut your question is really asking why this machine doesn't allow 'recursion' (embedding a code inside another code). And I think the answer is: I don't know what recursion should really do in this machine, and I don't think it would make the machine any more powerful. \n\nWhat do you think?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/259904010/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/259905202","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/3794#issuecomment-259905202","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/3794","id":259905202,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1OTkwNTIwMg==","user":{"login":"centosrhel","id":8177170,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNzcxNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8177170?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/centosrhel","html_url":"https://github.com/centosrhel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/centosrhel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/centosrhel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/centosrhel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/centosrhel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/centosrhel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/centosrhel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/centosrhel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/centosrhel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/centosrhel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-11T08:20:54Z","updated_at":"2016-11-11T08:20:54Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"done.\nresort to MXPredCreatePartialOut\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/259905202/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/259924881","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/3781#issuecomment-259924881","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/3781","id":259924881,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1OTkyNDg4MQ==","user":{"login":"sxjscience","id":5178350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzgzNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5178350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience","html_url":"https://github.com/sxjscience","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-11T10:09:30Z","updated_at":"2016-11-11T10:09:30Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@taliesinb Sorry I've misunderstood the meaning of -4.

Also 3) minibatches, which acts a lot like (2).\n\nI think a good way to solve this is by adopting a convention that a value of \"-1\" in the index input indicates that this entry should actually be treated as blank (sparse).  This means that sparse input data will have to be padded out to a fixed size of maximum number of non-zero entries. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/260170535/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/260170918","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/3669#issuecomment-260170918","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/3669","id":260170918,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MDE3MDkxOA==","user":{"login":"i-MaTh","id":22111654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTExNjU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22111654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/i-MaTh","html_url":"https://github.com/i-MaTh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/i-MaTh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/i-MaTh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/i-MaTh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/i-MaTh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/i-MaTh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/i-MaTh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/i-MaTh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/i-MaTh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/i-MaTh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-13T07:16:22Z","updated_at":"2016-11-13T07:16:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@piiswrong thanks!
