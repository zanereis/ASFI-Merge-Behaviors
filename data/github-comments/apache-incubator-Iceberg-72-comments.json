We would like to be able to support queries that compare tables across versions/times (eg a join between `table1@time1` and `table1@time2`) and be able to do this consistently on different engines. I suppose in time we can delegate to the Spark timestamp parsing logic if it can be found via reflection but in the end we will still have to parse timestamps at this level.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/760091723/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/760099383","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2031#issuecomment-760099383","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2031","id":760099383,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2MDA5OTM4Mw==","user":{"login":"rymurr","id":2022305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMjIzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2022305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr","html_url":"https://github.com/rymurr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-14T10:16:25Z","updated_at":"2021-01-14T10:16:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I am fine with this approach however I wonder what the flink folks think?

Saying primary key would make people feel the uniqueness is enforced, but it actually cannot enforce it. I don't have a strong opinion on this, but I constantly hear customers using Redshift complaining about this. Also, once we introduce primary key, there will definitely be an ask to have a foreign key concept. Just something to think about if we decide to go with this approach.\r\n\r\n+1 for having `primary key` without enforcement. Most of the Analytic databases are supporting informational `Primary Key` and `Foreign Key` Definitions without enforcing it, to use it as metadata. ex [snowflake](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/constraints-overview.html)\r\n\r\nVertica has good balance between both it enforces/checks [constraints during the read,join](http://vertica-forums.com/viewtopic.php?t=101#p143) and not checks it during insert.\r\n\r\nit could be good feature to have [ANALYZE_CONSTRAINTS](https://www.vertica.com/docs/9.2.x/HTML/Content/Authoring/SQLReferenceManual/Functions/VerticaFunctions/ANALYZE_CONSTRAINTS.htm) command with it user can validate constraint manually on a table. for-example after insert.\r\n\r\nin-case of enforcement it could be good idea to have flag on table level constraints ENABLED/DISABLED\r\nif its possible something like (for small and less frequently changing tables)\r\n1. append data to a table\r\n2. if `constraints_enabled` check constraint before commit!\r\n   - commit or rollback\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/760880495/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/760891071","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2092#issuecomment-760891071","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2092","id":760891071,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2MDg5MTA3MQ==","user":{"login":"XuQianJin-Stars","id":10494131,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDk0MTMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10494131?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars","html_url":"https://github.com/XuQianJin-Stars","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-15T11:37:12Z","updated_at":"2021-01-15T11:37:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks

But I also found a major problem, which is that `TestFlinkTableSource` now takes a very long time to run. The problem is that the tests run for each format and for 3 different catalog configurations. That means each test runs 9 times and because it is a test that actually runs SQL it takes a long time. The whole suite takes much longer than needed; on my machine, it takes about 4 minutes.\r\n\r\nThe filter pushdown tests only need to run for one catalog and one file format because the purpose of those tests is to validate the assumptions of the `FlinkFilter` class with real filters from Flink SQL. The file format and catalog are orthogonal and we don't need to test each one of them. Can you change the parameterization to run with only Avro and a single catalog case?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/761613165/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/761622405","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2081#issuecomment-761622405","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2081","id":761622405,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2MTYyMjQwNQ==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-16T19:49:23Z","updated_at":"2021-01-16T19:49:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks, @kbendick!

But I also found a major problem, which is that `TestFlinkTableSource` now takes a very long time to run. The problem is that the tests run for each format and for 3 different catalog configurations. That means each test runs 9 times and because it is a test that actually runs SQL it takes a long time. The whole suite takes much longer than needed; on my machine, it takes about 4 minutes.\r\n> \r\n> The filter pushdown tests only need to run for one catalog and one file format because the purpose of those tests is to validate the assumptions of the `FlinkFilter` class with real filters from Flink SQL. The file format and catalog are orthogonal and we don't need to test each one of them. Can you change the parameterization to run with only Avro and a single catalog case?\r\n\r\nI refactor it with `HadoopCatalog` and Avro type.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/761800697/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/761841353","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2087#issuecomment-761841353","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2087","id":761841353,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2MTg0MTM1Mw==","user":{"login":"karuppayya","id":5082742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwODI3NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5082742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya","html_url":"https://github.com/karuppayya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-17T16:41:28Z","updated_at":"2021-01-17T16:41:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@aokolnychyi Thanks for reviewing.

To me, I fail to see how we can get the count of NaN values in the following code block (though as I mentioned we can always continue to pass in `null` to match the existing behavior, provided the various metrics evaluators are aware that `null` for that Map entry for nullValueCounts doesnt convey much meaning for ORC).\r\n\r\nWe could also potentially track NaN values in the various orc writers, like the parquet writers do.\r\n\r\nThe relevant code for populating ORC metrics is here: https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/29915e3522f9a808420a2e16fb1c2cf3ae165a74/orc/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/orc/OrcMetrics.java#L100-L172","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/761919569/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/761941085","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/2098#issuecomment-761941085","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2098","id":761941085,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2MTk0MTA4NQ==","user":{"login":"kbendick","id":9833362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MzMzNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9833362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick","html_url":"https://github.com/kbendick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-18T02:36:22Z","updated_at":"2021-01-18T02:36:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I too have found that this test fails.

However, it does offer some clues, as the non-abstract test suites hat inherit from the higher up classes such as `TestExtensionsTestBase` all seem to pass. The issue appears to only be in `TestCopyOnWriteDelete`, which is possibly conflicting in its `DROP TABLE` statements with the other test suite that extends `SparkRowLevelOperationsTestBase`,  `TestCopyOnWrtieMerge`, or is conflicting with tests of its own.\r\n\r\nWoud making the names of the tables used in each test somewhat random prevent this scenario? I think this would entail updating `createAndInitTable` to take in the table name and then use that table name instead of a class level variable.

though.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/761941085/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/761941980","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/2098#issuecomment-761941980","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2098","id":761941980,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2MTk0MTk4MA==","user":{"login":"kbendick","id":9833362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MzMzNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9833362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick","html_url":"https://github.com/kbendick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-18T02:39:19Z","updated_at":"2021-01-18T02:39:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Additionally,

I can try and take a look to see if there's a cleaner approach that we might use.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval targetColumns = spark.sql(\"DESCRIBE EXTENDED target\").select(\"col_name\").as[String].collect()\r\nspark.sql(s\"insert into target select ${targetColumns.mkString(\", \")} from input\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is essentially @HeartSaVioR's answer, but with a more concrete way to determine the columns explicitly and their ordering.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/762044087/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/762046265","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/2098#issuecomment-762046265","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2098","id":762046265,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2MjA0NjI2NQ==","user":{"login":"kbendick","id":9833362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MzMzNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9833362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick","html_url":"https://github.com/kbendick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-18T07:31:54Z","updated_at":"2021-01-18T07:37:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Locally, when I increase the catalog config value for `clients` from 1 to 2 or higher, this has passed on the past 3 times I've tried it.

Yeah, we can join `manifest` with `snapshot` and `history` to get partition create/update time, but this join query is inefficient when there are large number of snapshots, we have to scan all snapshots and manifests.\r\n\r\nCould we add an additional `create-time` field to `manifest.data_file`?
