My function is in a docker container and the __ow_body is sometimes base64 encoded and sometimes not based on these two content-type values:\r\n`application/cloudevents+json`\r\n`application/cloudevents+json; charset=UTF-8`\r\nThe UTF one is given to me as raw json, while the other one is base64 encoded. IMO both should be raw json. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, it would be really nice if there was a flag (perhaps as a header) given to the function so it knows whether the body is base64 encoded or not. While I know it might be possible to look at the content-type and figure it out, you're asking the function to mimic the logic in OW to make that determination and that's not only error prone but could be a lot of work in the case where the function may not actually know about all of the various content-types and its acting more like a pass-thru. It seems like it would be really nice (from a UX) perspective if there was some flag someplace that the function could look at and know (w/o a doubt and w/o a lot of code) whether it needs to decode the body or not.\r\n\r\n/cc @csantanapr ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/386450729/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/386452951","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/3607#issuecomment-386452951","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/3607","id":386452951,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NjQ1Mjk1MQ==","user":{"login":"mrutkows","id":7816715,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MTY3MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7816715?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrutkows","html_url":"https://github.com/mrutkows","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrutkows/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrutkows/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrutkows/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrutkows/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrutkows/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrutkows/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrutkows/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrutkows/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrutkows/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-03T22:12:24Z","updated_at":"2018-05-04T14:18:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@markusthoemmes @houshengbo  Some things that seem clear to me:\r\n\r\n- We do not plan to distribute source code, only binary JVM/JDK libs.\r\n- The intent of the Oracle Binary Code License Agreement (BCLA) is that \"Oracle Java Standard Edition version 8 is still free as long as it is used for general purpose computing.\" (which includes JDK and JavaFx SDK).\r\n- OpenJ9/J9 (equivalent by name now) does not get us the JDK; it is the byte code interpreter only (JVM) and does not (according to my source) include any libs (i.e., JDK) so it does not give us what we need. Given that, If we use Eclipse OpenJ9 we would likely be able to ref. their license just fine.  \r\n- The \"Java community\" sponsors distributions that carefully construct JDK+OpenJ9 distributions that have carefully compiled all parts of Java (various licenses) to assure that consumers that they have no onerous licensing problems here: https://adoptopenjdk.net/ (including Docker images. \r\n    - Quoting the site \"AdoptOpenJDK provides prebuilt OpenJDK binaries from a fully open source set of build scripts and infrastructure. Looking for docker images? Pull them from our repository on dockerhub\". BUT it should still be investigated IMO.\r\n    - Java experts put this together, but it does not provide us a license; but we still need to point to licenses for each comp. that they built and brought together.  Note: it suprised me the reference Docker image (which may have come from this consortium) provides it under an Apache 2 license (see below).\r\n    - it seems (and need to confirm) that the docker image Vincent found (https://hub.docker.com/r/adoptopenjdk/openjdk8-openj9/) \"**_seems_**\" to be from that group and Docker hub lists it as Apache 2 license for the image only and has a long description of which says:  ``` Eclipse OpenJ9: The project license is Eclipse Public License 2.0 and Apache License, Version 2.0 (you can choose), but the EPLv2 license has a secondary compatibility for the GPL v2 that is used by OpenJDK. You can combine the two projects and use them together (as OpenJDK's GPL v2 of course). The full license is documented in the LICENSE file.``` and references their LICENSE file which I have not gone thru. \r\n\r\n**regardless, we should seek to validate our binary packing/distribution decisions with Apache legal.**\r\n\r\nMy inclination is to bring this issue up with our mentors via the PMC and have them help us get a read from Apache sources before doing any work around developer opinions.  The first step IMO would be to have someone create a complete description of what we intend to package (JVM version, JDK/libs, etc.) to get the most precise answer on the first

did some analysis of the time taken in a typical travis build. Detailed break up can be seen [here][1]\r\n\r\nFor purpose of this break up a custom [branch][2] was created where the `build.sh` was broken into sub scripts \r\n\r\n1. scan - scalaFmt, scanCode\r\n2. couch-setup\r\n3. compile - common and core\r\n4. distDocker\r\n5. runDocker\r\n6. runTests\r\n7. Collect logs\r\n\r\nThis was done as travis report explicit time per script entry in `script` block. Based on reports from [gradle][3] following summary can be made\r\n\r\n### Travis Time Breakup\r\n\r\n| Phase | Time (mins)|\r\n|-------|-------------|\r\n| Base| 12|\r\n| Docker work| 6|\r\n| Code scan| 2|\r\n| Test db only|11|\r\n| Test require docker|12|\r\n\r\nFurther breakup\r\n* Base ~12 mins\r\n    * Install 62 sec\r\n    * Couch 54 sec\r\n    * Compile Core 145 sec (2.4 mins)\r\n    * Compile Tests 386 sec (6.5 mins)\r\n    * logs 50 sec\r\n* Docker ~ 6 mins\r\n    * Dist Docker 170 secs\r\n    * Run all docker 180 secs\r\n* Tests ~ 33 mins\r\n    * Test just needing DB - 670 sec (11.15 min)\r\n    * Test needing full docker setup (excluding previous) - 733 sec (12.2 min)\r\n\r\n### Segregating Tests\r\n\r\nIn genral convention so far was to have tests under `system` package to depend on whole setup and tests outside just relying on database.

One possible approach can be to have 2 sets\r\n\r\n1. Tests requiring DB\r\n2. Tests requiring full setup\r\n\r\nIt would need to be ensured that both set cover all the tests present\r\n\r\n#### B - Use ScalaTest tags\r\n\r\nScalaTest supports [tagging the tests][1]. \r\n\r\nThe tags can be specified on per test basis\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nobject DbTest extends Tag(\"com.mycompany.tags.DbTest\")\r\n\r\nit must \"subtract correctly\" taggedAs(Slow, DbTest) in {\r\n    val diff = 4 - 1\r\n    assert(diff === 3)\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr can be specified [on whole suite][5] by defining a custom annotation. \r\n\r\n```scala\r\n@org.scalatest.TagAnnotation\r\n@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)\r\n@Target({ElementType.METHOD, ElementType.TYPE})\r\npublic @interface RequiresDb {}\r\n\r\n@tags.RequiresDb\r\nclass MyBusinessTest extends WordSpec with Matchers {\r\n  \"loads business objects from db\" in { ... }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese tags would then need to be used with Gradle. However default test runner in Gradle does not supports tags. For that we need to use [gradle scalatest][3] plugin.
