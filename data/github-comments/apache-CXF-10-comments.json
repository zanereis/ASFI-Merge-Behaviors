On the faulty path, we always stack at `awaitTermination` ... followed by interruption. \r\n\r\nNow, obviously, the question is what the alternative. I think a more reliable option would be to spin off the thread for `restartConnection`:\r\n```\r\nExceptionListener exListener = new ExceptionListener() {\r\n                public void onException(JMSException exception) {\r\n                    if (!shutdown) {\r\n                        LOG.log(Level.WARNING, \"Exception on JMS connection. Trying to reconnect\", exception);\r\n                        if (jmsListener == null) {\r\n                            restartConnection();\r\n                        } else {\r\n                            new Thread(new Runnable() {\r\n                                @Override\r\n                                public void run() {\r\n                                    restartConnection();\r\n                                }\r\n                            }).start();\r\n                        }\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n            };\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is definitely far from ideal, but taking the complexity of the `JMSDestination` & related components, it looks like an acceptable tradeoff. Yes, we may create a number of short-lived threads at peak, but only one would be doing useful work in fact. With this approach, we eliminate self-blocking at a cost of wasting more resources. It also means we should not call `stop` in `onException` but let `JMSDestination` to clean things up (it does inside the `deactivate`).\r\n\r\nThis is obviously a patch, not a proper solution, the thoughtful redesign would make more sense in the long run. What do you think?

It moves the fix completly into `JMSDestination` and it will work even if you replace or change `PollingMessageListenerContainer` \r\n\r\nBut I think it comes up with one problem: We have to revert my change in `restartConnection()`, which checks `jmsListener.isRunning()` before restarting a connection. Otherwise `restartConnection()` does nothing (`PollingMessageListenerContainer.running` is not unset).\r\nIt will cause every short-lived thread from `ExceptionListener` to stop and restart the connection. You get `jmsConfig.getConcurrentConsumers()` reconnects.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it's better to restart only once per `PollingMessageListenerContainer`/`ExceptionListener`-instance:\r\n```\r\nExceptionListener exListener = new ExceptionListener() {\r\n                private boolean restartTriggered = false;\r\n                public synchronized void onException(JMSException exception) {\r\n                    if (!shutdown && !restartTriggered) {\r\n                        LOG.log(Level.WARNING, \"Exception on JMS connection.

I don't know what is the best option to be fair, just an opinion if we have a single place to make the decisions (the factory bean), it would be much easier to reason about the outcome (proxy) and maintain it. The uncertainty with contexts may cause issues but I would leave the decision to you, I think you have a better view of the

Otherwise I can also do it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/584236388/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/584364179","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cxf/pull/639#issuecomment-584364179","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/639","id":584364179,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NDM2NDE3OQ==","user":{"login":"timpeeters","id":3816268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MTYyNjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3816268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timpeeters","html_url":"https://github.com/timpeeters","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timpeeters/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timpeeters/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timpeeters/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timpeeters/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timpeeters/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timpeeters/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timpeeters/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timpeeters/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timpeeters/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-10T21:24:58Z","updated_at":"2020-02-10T21:24:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for looking into this.

Seems it hasnt be done but the spec is not yet really part of MP stack I guess, so still a kind of big sandbox ;). \r\nTo be very concrete, today you have 3 kind of (java) users:\r\n\r\n1. JVM ones (java >= 11 in general),\r\n2. RxJava ones (they don't care of these abstractions cause they lack too much \"helpers\",\r\n3. java 8 guys doing what they can (often reactive streams).\r\n\r\nIndeed you can bridge between all these impl, even with the standard servlet or jaxrs reactive API (what this PR does) but it just adds noise in apps and is something to maintain in time, this is why I generally try to care to never add a dependency I don't need, and here it is not really needed.\r\n\r\nA quick note on the interop which is not always \"perfect\" (got a few issue with different netty libs if netty was not aligned upfront), can be seen as minor but still.\r\n\r\nThen, to be even more concrete, the interesting part of the reactive programming on producer side is the threading and this PR uses common pool which completely breaks the scalability of apps until tuned...on the JVM which prevents the tuning of the app if used anywhere else. So whatever is done, it will need to use a dedicated executor - either in the MP API or through cxf properties/extensions but not the default CXF one which is sized for other kind of requests.\r\n\r\nThen in terms of API you just reimpl it completely (cause reactivestreams is not an impl as Rx can be) so importing reactivestreams for 3 interfaces with 2-3 methods is very luxury IMHO.\r\n\r\nI'd prefer a module next to the default one enabling to unwrap as a reactive impl the cxf impl rather than the opposite which would enable to embrace all cases and drop reactivestreams when java 8 will be deprecated for example.\r\n\r\nHope it makes sense.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/616679437/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/616724202","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cxf/pull/660#issuecomment-616724202","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/660","id":616724202,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxNjcyNDIwMg==","user":{"login":"reta","id":509855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTg1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/509855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta","html_url":"https://github.com/reta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-20T18:12:20Z","updated_at":"2020-04-20T18:12:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@rmannibucau It certainly makes sense (implementation wise the PR needs some work, the ForkJoin pool was also on my list but I thought to have TCK tests first).

I discussed the idea of prereq-ing Java 11 with the MicroProfile community and have been pretty much shot down.  The current MP Reactive Streams Operators uses reactive streams and will continue to do so in MP 4.0.  I'm not giving up hope that we can change their mind though, because the 4.0 release is being delayed due to IP working group issues - so that is more time to plead my case. :-). But for now, I'd like to go ahead with using reactive streams to be consistent with the rest of the MP community.\r\n\r\n* Wrt to the reactive streams TCK - I really like that idea.  I'm thinking that it might be preferable to add the RS TCK to the MP Rest Client TCK so that all implementations of MP Rest Client 2.0 must implement a compliant Publisher for InboundSseEvents.  As you both have probably guessed, my initial implementation in this PR is not compliant.  I'm working on both the TCK in the MP project and the CXF implementation in parallel.  \r\n\r\n* Wrt the ForkJoinPool - good catch!  I'll plan to use the ExecutionService specified by the RestClientBuilder API, which defaults to the ForkJoinPool if none is specified.
