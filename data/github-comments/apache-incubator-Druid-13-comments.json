I'd prefer asking people to write wrapper scripts that take $PORT and turn it into -Dio.druid.port=\"$PORT\". We could provide scripts like this for our favorite execution environments if we want.\n\nThis is for a couple of reasons.\n\nFirst, I think we have enough ways of specifying configs: the properties file for pre-distributed stuff and jvm system properties for injected-at-startup stuff. Other than some whackiness with the Hadoop extensions, that's also all tucked away in the PropertiesModule, meaning there's just one place in the code that static properties can originate from. I think that's good.\n\nSecond, the purpose of these sorts of environment variables is to make it easier to run Druid in some execution environment. Those environments aren't standardized, so I don't think the benefit of simplifying just one of them is worth the potential annoyance of having things like this hard-coded.\n\nIf we do go with this patch, it definitely needs to include documentation, and should probably be part of new docs section describing what environment variables Druid respects.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/74338586/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/74533887","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1123#issuecomment-74533887","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1123","id":74533887,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0NTMzODg3","user":{"login":"fjy","id":428325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODMyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy","html_url":"https://github.com/fjy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-16T16:23:49Z","updated_at":"2015-02-16T16:23:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@housejester

For example:\n\n``` json\n\"aggregations\" : [\n  {\"type\" : \"count\", \"name\" : \"rows\"},\n  {\"type\" : \"cardinality\", \"name\" : \"dim_card\", \"fieldName\" : \"mydimension\"}\n],\n\"postAggregations\" : [{\n  \"type\"   : \"arithmetic\",\n  \"name\"   : \"average_rows_per_unique_value\",\n  \"fn\"     : \"/\",\n  \"fields\" : [\n    { \"type\" : \"fieldAccess\", \"name\" : \"rows\", \"fieldName\" : \"rows\" },\n    { \"type\" : \"hyperUniqueCardinality\", \"fieldName\" : \"dim_card\" }\n  ]\n}]\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/74718997/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/74721297","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1128#issuecomment-74721297","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1128","id":74721297,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0NzIxMjk3","user":{"login":"xvrl","id":815147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNTE0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/815147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl","html_url":"https://github.com/xvrl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-17T18:23:21Z","updated_at":"2015-02-17T18:23:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I rebased and merged this as part of this commit https://github.com/druid-io/druid/commit/b42b41cca7428b6dade4e2163e412fea4265fada\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/74721297/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/74734183","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1129#issuecomment-74734183","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1129","id":74734183,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0NzM0MTgz","user":{"login":"xvrl","id":815147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNTE0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/815147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl","html_url":"https://github.com/xvrl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-17T19:24:21Z","updated_at":"2015-02-17T19:24:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I feel that passing the injector directly rather than using the Map does not make things any simpler.

So 1 query would be expected to be quick because there would be almost no aggregates, and the second would be quick as well, because the results that need aggregating are greatly decreased as well due to the filter on the first results\n\n### Probably topN\n\nThe second thought is to have the query service be smarter about the topN results it is merging. Specifically, it could have knowledge of the individual topN results and the results relative rankings. For example: If a dimension value has the following ranks in the resultant segments: `[1, 2, 1, 4, 1]`, it is probably a perfect representation of the underlying data. But if another value has the following ranks in the returned segments : `[N/A, 2, 800, N/A, 5, 300]` Then it is very possible the results do not contain all the data for the value. This approach would essentially look at the variance in segment rank for each value and figure out how confident it is that the value has all its underlying data.\n\n### groupBy topN\n\nThe broker issues a groupBy query to the historicals and does the topN on the results that come back. I'm not a huge fan of this approach because it requires a lot of communication overhead.\n\nThese are just some initial brainstorms and I'm very open to any other suggestions.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/74913074/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/74919766","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/1134#issuecomment-74919766","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1134","id":74919766,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0OTE5NzY2","user":{"login":"drcrallen","id":8213081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMTMwODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8213081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen","html_url":"https://github.com/drcrallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-18T18:33:10Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T18:33:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"After chatting with @xvrl  for a bit, I think the solution for now is to update the docs to clarify when NOT to use a topN and either close this or leave it as a feature request.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/74919766/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/74922741","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1130#issuecomment-74922741","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1130","id":74922741,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0OTIyNzQx","user":{"login":"fjy","id":428325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODMyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy","html_url":"https://github.com/fjy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-18T18:49:12Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T18:49:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@housejester Thanks very much for this contrib!

true.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/76071151/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/76073398","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1148#issuecomment-76073398","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1148","id":76073398,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2MDczMzk4","user":{"login":"drcrallen","id":8213081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMTMwODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8213081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen","html_url":"https://github.com/drcrallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-25T22:20:27Z","updated_at":"2015-02-25T22:20:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"There
