thank you for taking the time to think about how to improve Pulsar Functions!\r\n\r\nJust to clarify somethings\r\n\r\n> As I understand the current implementation of pulsar functions is a 1:1 relation ship. One event in -> one event out. This is very limiting as one can not even write a function to filter out events. Also there are use cases when you get a batched message and you need to \"unpack\" it into single events. Or when you need to interpolate values from a previous event (which is held in the state).\r\n\r\nYou are able to return \"null\" in a function for filtering purposes\r\n\r\n> I propose that the interface should be something along the lines Function<I, ? extends Collection<O>>.\r\n\r\nWe can have such an interface\r\n\r\n> If you consider a PublishFunction then I see here the following problem. In the very moment you also need to store a state via the Context you get a timing issue. What if you stored the state but then for some reason you are not able to send to the topic. Or even worse what if you could send n of m messages and then the network fails? I would be clean and easier when pulsar handles all these cases outside of the function implementation.\r\n\r\nTo send a message to any topic from a function:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncontext.newOutputMessage(publishTopic, Schema.STRING).value(output).sendAsync();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis method returns a CompletableFuture.  You can always wait for the CompletableFuture to complete before updating the state.   If there is a send failure, throw an exception, and in EFFECTIVELY_ONCE, the function instance will restart it self and replay the last message.  Thus, your state doesn't get updated for a message that didn't get sent out.  Of course updating the state could fail in theory and you would have sent a message but not updated the state.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can also use another Pulsar Topic as a K/V state store and publish state updates to the state to that topic.  By using message sequence IDs and idempotent producing, you can achieve exactly-once state updates.  This solution will take more implementation on the user's part.\r\n\r\n@sijie is adding transaction support in Pulsar, so we can also see if we can update consume, update function state, and publish message(s) all in a single transaction\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/501798700/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/501802181","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/4391#issuecomment-501802181","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/4391","id":501802181,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMTgwMjE4MQ==","user":{"login":"hellozepp","id":20615623,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjE1NjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20615623?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hellozepp","html_url":"https://github.com/hellozepp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hellozepp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hellozepp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hellozepp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hellozepp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hellozepp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hellozepp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hellozepp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hellozepp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hellozepp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-13T17:28:51Z","updated_at":"2019-06-13T17:30:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@sijie Glad to get your help.

thanks for the clarification, I did not get that returning null is an option :-) \r\n\r\nregarding returning multiple events, I am not saying it is impossible but it is a bit trickier then that:\r\n\r\n> This method returns a CompletableFuture. You can always wait for the CompletableFuture to complete before updating the state. If there is a send failure, throw an exception, and in EFFECTIVELY_ONCE, the function instance will restart it self and replay the last message. \r\n\r\nImagine if you have 10 futures, 5 completed, 5 failed\r\nYou did not store the state (you would only if all futures completed)\r\nYou throw an exception\r\nFunction restarts (EFFECTIVELY_ONCE)\r\n\r\nNow you have the same sate as the one you have had but not stored (function needs to be deterministic). But you have sent 5 of 10 events already, so you need to know that you only have to send messages 6 - 10 plus finally store the state. This could be done by querying the last message/event on the target topic. And this would even hold if only the state store would fail. Because in such a case you throw an exception at stateStore(), in the redo call of the function you see 10 of 10 messages were sent, so you just store the state.\r\n\r\nHowever I just think it would be much more user friendly if this is all handled by the function caller and you could optimize accordingly while the project evolves.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/501981361/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/502014450","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/4533#issuecomment-502014450","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/4533","id":502014450,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMjAxNDQ1MA==","user":{"login":"codelipenghui","id":12592133,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTkyMTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12592133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui","html_url":"https://github.com/codelipenghui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-14T08:13:19Z","updated_at":"2019-06-14T08:13:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Jennifer88huang
