I think you asked a very good question, why we have a field `conn type` which didn't link to anything. Maybe we can ask who designed this. \r\n\r\nIMO, it could be useful:\r\n1. from user experience perspective, sometimes you cannot tell which is which by reading connection settings. For instance, any hook based on TCP looks similar e.g. HTTP/FTP/SFTP/SSH... Airflow sometimes are tools not only for developers, but also for analysts or data scientist. Those people may not be familiar with those protocols. By having a conn type, they can quickly recognize them. \r\n2. from develop perspective, there is a factory method ```get_conn``` in ```models/connection.py```. The purpose of that one looks like providing a DB conn. In my use case, I made a download/upload interface for any file storage or transfer protocols such as FTP/SFTP/S3/Azure etc. A factory method is needed to get the correct hook based on identifiers. If we have more specific conn_type, it would be great for simplifying my code. \r\n\r\nFurther, I think any existing hook should have its corresponding conn type. Or the conn type could be registered to existing hook. This may related to the topic that AIP-8 split Hooks/Operators to separate repos.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/465371583/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/465377817","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4739#issuecomment-465377817","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4739","id":465377817,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NTM3NzgxNw==","user":{"login":"feng-tao","id":3223098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjMwOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3223098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao","html_url":"https://github.com/feng-tao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-20T01:12:13Z","updated_at":"2019-02-20T01:40:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Actually given we remove the old UI which should be the sole place that used flask-admin, do we still need this dependency?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/465377817/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/465401112","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4739#issuecomment-465401112","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4739","id":465401112,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NTQwMTExMg==","user":{"login":"suburbanmtman","id":2625471,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjU0NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2625471?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/suburbanmtman","html_url":"https://github.com/suburbanmtman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suburbanmtman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suburbanmtman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suburbanmtman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suburbanmtman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suburbanmtman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suburbanmtman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suburbanmtman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suburbanmtman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suburbanmtman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-20T02:58:53Z","updated_at":"2019-02-20T02:59:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"flask-admin is still referenced in a few areas but I'm not sure if those components are still necessary given the UI rewrite:\r\n\r\nAirflowViewPlugin -

Ignoring with `.airflowignore` should also be slightly faster than the heuristic, since we don't have to read each file and check each line for matching strings. Including \"DAG\" and \"airflow\" in a comment works, but if a developer forgets to do it, they'll be confused and wonder why their DAG isn't showing up. If we want to whitelist specific files, I think it would make more sense to do it explicitly, by defining a list of files to load, rather than implicitly via string contents.\r\n\r\nAnyway, to minimize any disruption, the `use_dag_discovery_heuristic` flag defaults to `True`, so users would only opt in if the heuristic is causing headaches for them.

This means the plugin author can't rely objects/classes being available when their plugin is loaded (eg, flask-app/config) as changes are made to Airflow between releases. \r\n\r\nI don't have a wider proposal for what the full plugin lifecycle would be, but I think encouraging all the imperative actions to be encapsulated in the on_load method, reduces the risk of plugins breaking because a component the author may be interacting with does not yet exist.\r\n\r\nSort of providing developers with a predictable safe way to bootstrap the components in their plugins.\r\n\r\nI appreciate the example does not fall pray to these issues, but I'm suggesting our example should provide \"best practice\" and I'm suggesting what our best practice should be. :-)\r\n\r\nIf you'd still prefer not, I'll close the PR.
