I think we'll just have to rely on TravisCI until this issue is resolved.\r\n\r\nThough, it looks like the first part of the bug is still an issue. The ``dfdlx.xsd`` file has the following lines:\r\n```xml\r\n  <xs:import namespace=\"urn:ogf:dfdl:2013:imp:daffodil.apache.org:2018:int\" schemaLocation=\"xsd/dafint.xsd\" />\r\n  <xs:import namespace=\"http://www.ogf.org/dfdl/dfdl-1.0/\" schemaLocation=\"xsd/DFDL_part3_model.xsd\" />\r\n```\r\nThe bug report says that the schemaLocation attributes should be this:\r\n```xml\r\n  <xs:import namespace=\"urn:ogf:dfdl:2013:imp:daffodil.apache.org:2018:int\" schemaLocation=\"dafint.xsd\" />\r\n  <xs:import namespace=\"http://www.ogf.org/dfdl/dfdl-1.0/\" schemaLocation=\"DFDL_part3_model.xsd\" />\r\n```\r\nI.e., the \"xsd\" directory is removed from the schemaLocation. I'd doesn't look like that was fixed as another PR. I *think* the bug is right and the xsd should be removed.\r\n\r\nAlso, I recommend changing the commit message to remove the squashed commit messge \"fixed broken tag\" since the squashed commit doesn't actually fix any broken tags. Also, in the Daffodil project, the standard is to list the bug number at the end of the commit message, so your commit message should look something like this:\r\n\r\n> xs:import problems with xsd files provided in daffodil-lib\r\n>\r\n> Removed extra whitespace\r\n>\r\n> DAFFODIL-2200","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/535533801/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/535674362","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/269#issuecomment-535674362","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/269","id":535674362,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNTY3NDM2Mg==","user":{"login":"dineshchitlangia","id":7876939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NzY5Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7876939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dineshchitlangia","html_url":"https://github.com/dineshchitlangia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dineshchitlangia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dineshchitlangia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dineshchitlangia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dineshchitlangia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dineshchitlangia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dineshchitlangia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dineshchitlangia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dineshchitlangia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dineshchitlangia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-26T20:31:20Z","updated_at":"2019-09-26T20:31:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@stevedlawrence thank you for checking this PR.

I thought I saw tests of those though, so this may be spurious.\r\n\r\nOther than that the non-coverage things look to be limitations of the scala compiler. E.g., it seems to always say this line is not covered:\r\n\r\n`val Some(x) = y`\r\n\r\nprobably because it doesn't know that y is always type Some on this code path, so it thinks this assignment can fail possibly, and that failure path is not covered by tests of course, because it actually is not really possible. Rewriting as:\r\n\r\n`val x = y.get`\r\n\r\nShould remove the coverage red-mark, because the type-check code path is now over in the definition of the get method of the Option type, not here in this code. \r\n\r\nThe latter may also generate better/smaller code. Or rather, we know for sure what y.get is going to do, whereas the pattern assignment may or may not (depending on optimizers) contain calls to unapply methods and other artifacts of how pattern destructuring works. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/548792044/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/548917258","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/282#issuecomment-548917258","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/282","id":548917258,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0ODkxNzI1OA==","user":{"login":"stevedlawrence","id":3180601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODA2MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3180601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence","html_url":"https://github.com/stevedlawrence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-01T19:16:54Z","updated_at":"2019-11-01T19:16:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"No idea why that one failed, looks like something just got stuck on github's end.

We were testing if the result of eval was ever a PState. \r\n* A second was a Scala BigInt vs Java BigInteger mistake. This turned out not to be the cause of the type-calc issue, and I do not know of a code path that would expose this mistake (not that I looked particuarly hard for one).\r\n\r\nWe have some tests from the original PR at daffodil-test/src/test/resources/org/apache/daffodil/extensions/type_calc \r\n\r\nNone of these were created with pedagogy in mind, but some of the early examples  in inputTypeCalc.tdml (namely the keysetValue examples) show the simple usecase; where the parser consumes a byte and outputs a string and the unparser does the inverse.\r\n\r\nI am working on a seperate PR to fix the original typeCalc problem that started this. That fix builds off of the work here, but involves a fairly significant refactoring of the typeCalc system, so I want to keep it as a seperate PR.\r\n\r\nThat PR will add a TDML test that demonstrates the more advanced usecase where both the integer and string representations are preservered in the infoset.\r\n\r\nFor pedagogical purposes, it might makes sense to create a separate tdml file with just example test cases. As is, the useful examples are mixed in with more unit-testy ones.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/566346597/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/569714434","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/308#issuecomment-569714434","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/308","id":569714434,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2OTcxNDQzNA==","user":{"login":"jadams-tresys","id":30659277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjU5Mjc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30659277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadams-tresys","html_url":"https://github.com/jadams-tresys","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadams-tresys/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadams-tresys/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadams-tresys/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadams-tresys/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadams-tresys/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadams-tresys/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadams-tresys/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadams-tresys/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadams-tresys/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-30T15:45:07Z","updated_at":"2019-12-30T15:45:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The

Then say the vote failed and we needed to make a minor fix (e.g. update LICENSE) and create a new release candidate. The complex change isn't going to have as much testing, and could make the new release candidate less stable. In that case, I think it makes sense to hold off on merging the complex change until after the release is out so that it is slated for the following release.\r\n\r\nWe could take it on a case by case basis (in this case, I think it would be fine to merge and include in a new release candidate if there happened to be one), but then we need to define what level of complexity is okay which isn't obvious. It might be easier to just define a rule that says no merging during release votes?\r\n\r\nThoughts? This discussion might be more appropriate for the dev list, but I think this is the first PR where this has come up so thought I'd mention it here before we merge.\r\n\r\n—\r\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\r\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub<https://github.com/apache/incubator-daffodil/pull/361#pullrequestreview-395482133>, or unsubscribe<https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AALUDA7MRCPIQPUZUQR7L4LRNBOTVANCNFSM4MKXP3UQ>.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/615328650/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/617862582","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/367#issuecomment-617862582","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/367","id":617862582,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxNzg2MjU4Mg==","user":{"login":"mbeckerle","id":1524099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1524099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle","html_url":"https://github.com/mbeckerle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-22T15:48:48Z","updated_at":"2020-04-22T15:48:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Broken.
