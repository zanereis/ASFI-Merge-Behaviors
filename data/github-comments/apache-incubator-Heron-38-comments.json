Currently test code coverage is good, but either tests at at a higher level (i.e., the Packing impls) or at a lower lever (i.e., `PackingUtilsTest`).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/257414940/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/257685824","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/1521#issuecomment-257685824","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1521","id":257685824,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NzY4NTgyNA==","user":{"login":"kramasamy","id":367684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzY4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/367684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy","html_url":"https://github.com/kramasamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-01T20:29:44Z","updated_at":"2016-11-01T20:29:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@avflor

Parallelism is S(1), IB(2), A(1) and we scale S up and IB down to produce S(2), IB(1), A(1). This is the sequence of events:\n1. Launch topology.\n2. S emits A,B,A\n3. IB[1] receives and relays A, A.

I've located the issue and verified with @maosongfu. The current integration test spout tracks how many tuples it sends and decrements that count back to zero to determine when it should send terminals, which indicate the job is done. The decrement occurs in both the `ack` and `fail` methods of the spout and there is no resend mechanism implemented in `fail` to re-emit. This opens up two failure scenarios that I've seen:\n1. In the scenario I reported above the stream manager restarts and fails to emit some tuples to the aggregator bolt. The final tuple counts are low because there is no re-emit implemented.\n2. The stream manager successfully relays all tuples, but upon restart it loses it's state and reports a failures back upstream. In this cases all tuples are received, but the `fail` method is invoked (false negative) on the spout. This only results in a test failure if I comment out the decrement in the `fail` method, since what's sent and received matches on both ends. By not decrementing the topology will never finish.\n\nI'm going to fix by doing the following:\n1. Change the spout to re-emit tuples when `fail` is called.\n2. Change the spout to not decrement the number-of-remaining-items-to-ack count on `fail`, only on `ack`.\n3. Change test assertion to verify at least once (as opposed to exactly once), since we could get re-transmits.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/258041583/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/258064722","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/1521#issuecomment-258064722","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1521","id":258064722,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1ODA2NDcyMg==","user":{"login":"ashvina","id":10034060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDM0MDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10034060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashvina","html_url":"https://github.com/ashvina","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashvina/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashvina/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashvina/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashvina/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashvina/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashvina/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashvina/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashvina/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashvina/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-03T04:58:54Z","updated_at":"2016-11-03T04:58:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM 👍 \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/258064722/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/258096836","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1499#issuecomment-258096836","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1499","id":258096836,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1ODA5NjgzNg==","user":{"login":"wangli1426","id":5260276,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNjAyNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5260276?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangli1426","html_url":"https://github.com/wangli1426","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangli1426/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangli1426/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangli1426/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangli1426/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangli1426/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangli1426/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangli1426/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangli1426/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangli1426/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-03T09:34:28Z","updated_at":"2016-11-03T09:34:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@maosongfu @billonahill @avflor @kramasamy Any update?
