 how to handle multiple outputs? i was trying `dropout` and `batchnorm`, both have multiple outputs.\r\nIn `RELAY_REGISTER_OP`, like `set_num_inputs`, do we have something like `set_num_outputs`?\r\nI think currently `Array<Type>& types` will have only (inputs + one output)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/427757662/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/427807684","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/1799#issuecomment-427807684","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1799","id":427807684,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNzgwNzY4NA==","user":{"login":"srkreddy1238","id":14215163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjE1MTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14215163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238","html_url":"https://github.com/srkreddy1238","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-08T12:03:25Z","updated_at":"2018-10-08T12:03:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"multiple
