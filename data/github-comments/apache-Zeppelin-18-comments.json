I think not exactly. `ZEPPELIN_CLASSPATH` is built by prepending elements to the classpath, meaning, whatever the user puts in the class path is, at the time of complete class path, placed at the very end of the class path. Consider a scenario:\n\nSomebody wants to put a patched `spark-core` jar into the class path. He will set `ZEPPELIN_CLASSPATH` to his `/opt/whatever/spark-core_2.10-1.5.1.jar` and proceed with the standard procedure for `zeppelin.sh`. His jar will not be the effective one. The reason is that the class path built by Zeppelin is the following:\n\n```\nZEPPELIN_CLASSPATH=<addJar>:$ZEPPELIN_CLASSPATH\n...\nZEPPELIN_CLASSPATH=<addJar>:$ZEPPELIN_CLASSPATH\n```\n\nI believe what @echarles introduces here, is the mechanism for the user to be able to override any arbitrary functionality _no matter what_.\n\nVery nice feature, @echarles.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/153572008/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/153590401","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/175#issuecomment-153590401","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/175","id":153590401,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MzU5MDQwMQ==","user":{"login":"bzz","id":5582506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1ODI1MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5582506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz","html_url":"https://github.com/bzz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-04T06:15:51Z","updated_at":"2015-11-04T06:15:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thank your addressing all the feedback @sjeandeaux ! \n\nIt looks great but I have one more question, sorry if I missed that one before. As @jersub mention, the built image does not contain the built binary of zeppelin itself right now, am I right? \n\nSo what the use case you have in mind? For now I can imagine one, looking like this:\n\n```\ndocker build -t zeppelin\ndocker run -it ...\nmvn package ...\n./bin/zeppelin-daemon.sh\n```\n\nAnd then Zeppelin becomes accessible on the forwarded host ports, right?\n\nThis is all good, but what if we at the same time will support something like this:\n\n```\ndocker build -t zeppelin\ndocker push\ndocker run ....  \n```\n\nand then have Zeppelin accessible on the forwarded host ports?\n\nThis way people who do not want to build it - could just opt out for the fast\n\n```\ndocker pull ..\ndocker run ..\n```\n\nFor the second and third case to work just a few minor changes required, like \n- expose `SPARK_HOME` and `HADOOP_HOME` to the container, as it affects the build\n- actually build zeppelin like `RUN mvn package ....` (and you can still override it w/ your own `/home/zeppelin/incubator-zeppelin/`  in `-it` mode, so we keep the ability to build inside the container, as in case 1)\n- point default PID1 script of the image to `/home/zeppelin/incubator-zeppelin/bin/zeppelin.sh`\n\nBut I think that might provide a lot of value for users who do not wish to build Zeppelin manually.\nWhat do you think?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/153590401/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/153590702","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/387#issuecomment-153590702","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/387","id":153590702,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MzU5MDcwMg==","user":{"login":"bzz","id":5582506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1ODI1MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5582506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz","html_url":"https://github.com/bzz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-04T06:16:53Z","updated_at":"2015-11-04T06:16:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"looks good to me\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/153590702/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/153636651","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/382#issuecomment-153636651","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/382","id":153636651,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MzYzNjY1MQ==","user":{"login":"xhudik","id":1122020,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjIwMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1122020?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xhudik","html_url":"https://github.com/xhudik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xhudik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xhudik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xhudik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xhudik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xhudik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xhudik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xhudik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xhudik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xhudik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-04T08:38:26Z","updated_at":"2015-11-04T08:38:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@felixcheung  -
