Removing the need for the `types()` call is really great!\n\nAs commented inline, I would replace the current API for the projection operator by your implementation, instead of adding new API methods. With your solution, the old project API becomes obsolete. I know, this is an API breaking change, but users only need to remove the types call. Maybe, we can even add a dummy `types()` method to the `ProjectOperator` and mark it as deprecated.\nPorting the API, would also require to adapt all examples and test cases that use projection.\n\nFlink's documentation is also contained in the git repository as .md files. We did this to keep documenation and code in sync. The adapted documenation should be part of an API changing PR. You find the documenation in the ./docs folder. The following files need to be adapted: \n- ./docs/programming_guide.md\n- ./docs/dataset_transformations.md\n\nAgain, great work and thanks for your contribution!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/62519985/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/62520098","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/194#issuecomment-62520098","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/194","id":62520098,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNTIwMDk4","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-11T09:08:19Z","updated_at":"2014-11-11T09:08:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@StephanEwen Damn, I was too slow ;-)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/62520098/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
