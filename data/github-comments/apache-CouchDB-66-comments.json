Sorry to disturb. I have a question regarding `sizes.active` vs `sizes.file`.\r\nI'm debugging one production glitch with our monitoring and this led me to the next test case which I didn't understand. So: \r\nI have a database with `revs_limit=1000`, it contains only one document with the size 113 bytes (two small text fields). This document has 1001 revisions and revisions 4 and 5 of this document had attachment which weighted 666624 bytes. In revision 6 attachment was removed and then I just generated 995 revisions. Compaction is disabled hence I still can get that attachment for rev 5. Now when I query db size at this state I see:\r\n```\r\nsizes: {\r\nfile: 31364327,\r\nexternal: 666701,\r\nactive: 799810\r\n}\r\n```\r\n`active` size looks more or less correct: 113bytes*1000 + 666624  + (I guess) some db headers and meta info. But why `file` size is  31364327? This totally dumbfounded me. What are those 30Mb for? \r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n*UPD* I think I know the answer partially. This is a 4096-byte block which is added on each append (new revision). And even if the actual data is much smaller still the whole block will be allocated and added. But still this gives only around 4Mb and there is still 26Mb of unknown dark matter in the file. \r\n\r\nP.S. \"Wrong\"-looking `external` size I guess is the subject of this PR hence I'm not asking about it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/465693692/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/465696780","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/1926#issuecomment-465696780","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1926","id":465696780,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NTY5Njc4MA==","user":{"login":"wohali","id":112292,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjI5Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112292?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali","html_url":"https://github.com/wohali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-20T18:23:24Z","updated_at":"2019-02-20T18:23:24Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"See https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/incubator/couchdb","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/465696780/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/465698656","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/1927#issuecomment-465698656","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1927","id":465698656,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NTY5ODY1Ng==","user":{"login":"wohali","id":112292,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjI5Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112292?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali","html_url":"https://github.com/wohali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-20T18:28:29Z","updated_at":"2019-02-20T18:28:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Really not comfortable with having to bump each .app.src file with every change to that revision tree.
