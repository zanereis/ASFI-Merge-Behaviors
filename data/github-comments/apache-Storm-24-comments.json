Turns out that our krb5.conf had a setting in it that was forwardable = yes, not forwardable = true.  This was fine for the rest of kerberos, but mad java think it was not supposed to ask for a forwardable ticket.  So when it got back the renewed ticket from the KDC something didn't match and it got very angry.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for all of your help resolving this.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612469377/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/48507857","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/180#issuecomment-48507857","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/180","id":48507857,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NTA3ODU3","user":{"login":"revans2","id":3441321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDEzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3441321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2","html_url":"https://github.com/revans2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-09T17:36:59Z","updated_at":"2014-07-09T17:36:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 looks good to me.

We use Utils.getInt() to read configuration parameters.<br/>\n    2. Utils.getInt() uses Long.intValue(). It just convert long to int by narrow conversion, using lowest 4 bytes so it would be weird value.<br/>\n    <a

noopener\">http://www.myhowto.org/java/60-understanding-the-primitive-numeric-type-conversions-in-java/</a><br/>\n    3. based on 2. we need to restrict configuration parameters using strict type validation.<br/>\n    (clojure seems to use long instead of int, so it should be with range check.)</p>\n\n<p>    I checked parameter's type.<br/>\n    int is enough for most of these, topology sample rate needs double.<br/>\n    So I introduce IntegerValidator, IntegersValidator (for ports, etc), DoubleValidator.</p>\n\n<p>You can merge this pull request into a Git repository by

It just makes means that if you have that config wrong you will not be able to read any of the data in ZK.  In my testing the CPU utilization did not go up noticeably so I didn't see much of a reason to make it configurable.  The only think I would be nervous about is if this code is being used for the transactional zookeeper too.
