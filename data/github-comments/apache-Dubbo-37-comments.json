I believe the `version` here means the implementation version of the RPC Protocol,  also the Protocol-Specific-Version means the specification of RPC Protocol. If i understand the `version` in a right way, don’t think it should be changed for every release(or at least don’t have to be the same with the jar version).\n\nI know that there maybe some compatible problems if someone relies on this “version number the same with the jar version” rule, but this change should not cause any critical problems on remote procedures. I tend to do this when i have to do a compatible upgrade for RPC protocols, check this PR(https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/pull/1442#issuecomment-371776703 <https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/pull/1442#issuecomment-371776703>, not completely finished yet). I think it would be better for us to keep a stable version number instead of change every release.\n\nOnly my opinion. And I believe when we follow the apache way by using the dev mailing list - dev@dubbo.apache.org, we can avoid any changes before they are fully discussed.\n\n> On 14 Mar 2018, at 3:51 PM, ss宋顺 <song_s@Ctrip.com> wrote:\n> \n> Hi Jun,\n> \n> We have integrated dubbo with our tracing system, which will include dubbo version in each rpc call event.\n> \n> The version information is one of the key diagnosis information when some service meets something wrong.\n> \n> So yes, this change does have some side effects.
