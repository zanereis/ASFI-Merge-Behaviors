You must use the ways described previously.\n\nSo I don't know any better ways to avoid this, and my suggestion:\nWhy not just expose part of each operators( especially the parameters) to (c/cpp) users as a header, and this not seem to increase the amount of work when adding new

a lot for the suggestion. \n\nBasically, I did not need to build a whole new layer. Since the nice design of symbolic and binding executors, I just need to implement the outer gradient for the executor to do backward. The whole model also used the dmlc/experiment-lda, which is a fast sampler. The whole project would be better in cpp for speed. \n\nBy the way, another question is sparse input feature for neural nets. I use the neural nets for modeling text and using side information as feature input. Therefore, the input is very sparse. I use NDArray as input, so it would be a very sparse matrix from the view of numpy array. Is this okay and efficient to use NDArrary?

Sorry for the so stupid question causing the confusion and time wasting......Thank you very much!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/164636558/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/164636561","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/829#issuecomment-164636561","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/829","id":164636561,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NDYzNjU2MQ==","user":{"login":"mli","id":421857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTg1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/421857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli","html_url":"https://github.com/mli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-15T03:45:52Z","updated_at":"2015-12-15T03:45:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"do a merge now, but will seek a better solution at the same time\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/164636561/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/164636746","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/922#issuecomment-164636746","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/922","id":164636746,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NDYzNjc0Ng==","user":{"login":"mli","id":421857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTg1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/421857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli","html_url":"https://github.com/mli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-15T03:47:45Z","updated_at":"2015-12-15T03:47:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"let's move to #903\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/164636746/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/164636815","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/919#issuecomment-164636815","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/919","id":164636815,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NDYzNjgxNQ==","user":{"login":"toothacher17","id":7029845,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMjk4NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7029845?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/toothacher17","html_url":"https://github.com/toothacher17","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toothacher17/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toothacher17/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toothacher17/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toothacher17/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toothacher17/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toothacher17/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toothacher17/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toothacher17/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toothacher17/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-15T03:48:30Z","updated_at":"2015-12-15T03:48:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I guess you mean this one?
