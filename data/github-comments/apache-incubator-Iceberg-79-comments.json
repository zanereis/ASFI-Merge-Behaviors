I think you are right, at least partially, it is a Flink bug anyway. Before [FLIP-147(Support Checkpoints After Tasks Finished)](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/x/mw-ZCQ) , sink writers sit in dilemma situation that there is no reliable way to commit final result to external system. `endInput` was not designed to commit final result, but actually has been used for a workaround/last-resort. There is no strong guarantee that `endInput` will be invoked only once. So basically, if sink writers want to commit final result in `endInput`, they should prepare for situations that `endInput` could run multiple times. Thus, @openinx the test should not focus (or focus only) on stop-with-savepoint, but multiple runs of `endInput`.\r\n\r\nI want quote some comments from our discussions here.\r\n\r\n@aljoscha [said](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-21132?focusedCommentId=17274459&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-17274459) that:\r\n\r\n> The motivation for introducing endOfInput() were things like hash-join in the SQL runner where an operator would read from the build side until getting an end-of-input, at which point it would switch over to reading from the probe side. With these use cases in mind sending an endOfInput() is a bug. The same is true for sinks, which will do some bookkeeping based on knowing that all the input data has been read.\r\n\r\n@gaoyunhaii [said](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-21132?focusedCommentId=17271999&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-17271999) that:\r\n\r\n> First of all, I think there would be some problem fro the current implementation that committed in endOfInput(), considering if the job is bounded (namely the first case). The problem is that if the failover happens right after commit() in the endOfInput, then the job will be restarted and fallback to the last checkpoint, which will cause replay of the data committed in endOfInput. FLIP-147: Support checkpoint after tasks finished is a precedent step to solve the commit problem of the sinks in the first case.\r\n\r\ncc @pnowojski  @aljoscha @gaoyunhaii @rkhachatryan @becketqin @StephanEwen @tillrohrmann","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/784153620/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/784154992","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1870#issuecomment-784154992","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1870","id":784154992,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4NDE1NDk5Mg==","user":{"login":"ismailsimsek","id":6005685,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMDU2ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6005685?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ismailsimsek","html_url":"https://github.com/ismailsimsek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ismailsimsek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ismailsimsek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ismailsimsek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ismailsimsek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ismailsimsek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ismailsimsek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ismailsimsek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ismailsimsek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ismailsimsek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-23T12:07:54Z","updated_at":"2021-02-23T12:07:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"sorry i got busy with some other stuff, it should be close to finish, @XuQianJin-Stars please feel free to add your review @rdblue  @jackye1995  its ready for another review","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/784154992/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/784160924","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/2260#issuecomment-784160924","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2260","id":784160924,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4NDE2MDkyNA==","user":{"login":"pvary","id":19705742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzA1NzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19705742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary","html_url":"https://github.com/pvary","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-23T12:18:41Z","updated_at":"2021-02-23T12:18:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> > new Object[] { \"testhive\", SparkCatalog.class.getName(), ImmutableMap.of(\r\n> > \"type\", \"hive\",\r\n> > \"default-namespace\", \"default\"\r\n> > )},\r\n> \r\n> how to use this config!

I'm not sure there's enough information in the issue to understand why a different method can't be used, or if it is a good idea to expose this. It sounds like you're constructing different schemas and using stats differently, so how much similarity is there? The Parquet values produced by this are specific to Iceberg's object model. If you're building something different from Iceberg then I would say that it makes the most sense for you to have similar code for your use case.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/785322301/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/785403354","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2255#issuecomment-785403354","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2255","id":785403354,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4NTQwMzM1NA==","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-24T21:41:54Z","updated_at":"2021-02-24T21:41:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've addressed some of the comments. Still open questions:\r\n\r\n- Having `options` in the `Action` directly. That seems simpler than having `ConfigurableAction`.\r\n- Accepting Strings instead of Tables in all actions so that each action loads the table. My worry is that it will require a proper catalog config for resolution. I think most people will leverage SQL extensions for simple cases so it feels more flexible to pass the `Table` object. However, I agree it is not consistent with `snapshotTable` and `migrateTable`.\r\n- Shall we make action results closeable? Seems like that would really complicate the usage so maybe we can skip doing that unless needed by other query engines.\r\n- Using `with` prefix for some method names.

In another project, they may have a set of different props.\r\n\r\nI believe Spark has does that in some cases already. For instance, properties like `spark.datasource.ds_name.key` are propagated into sources during some operations. I'd vote for a catalog-native solution in Spark 3. That way, it will become a standard way of representing this in Spark.\r\n\r\nThe session conf can look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nspark.sql.catalog.cat_name.table_defaults.key1 = value1\r\nspark.sql.catalog.cat_name.table_defaults.key2 = value2\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen individual property values in create statements will override what is in the session conf.\r\n\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE ...\r\nTBLPROPERTIES (\r\n  'k2' 'custom_value'\r\n)\r\n````\r\n\r\nIn the future, we can also support read and write options.\r\n\r\n```\r\n// the name is arbitrary\r\ninterface SupportsSessionConfigDefaults extends TableCatalog {\r\n    String tablePropertiesPrefix();\r\n}\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/786255694/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/786256705","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2240#issuecomment-786256705","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2240","id":786256705,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4NjI1NjcwNQ==","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-25T22:00:35Z","updated_at":"2021-02-25T22:00:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"We

I considered using Iceberg's table identifier but it is in the `catalog` package, which makes it weird. Plus, one identifier will point to a non-Iceberg table. Apart from that, only implementations will parse identifiers and the syntax could (?) actually vary from engine to engine.

We do serialize things like spec and props so maybe it won't be a big deal to serialize the complete table object but someone has to test that.

With the `CompactionStrategy` we could tell the user to customize the rewrite strategy case by case.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/786480334/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/786600794","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2254#issuecomment-786600794","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2254","id":786600794,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4NjYwMDc5NA==","user":{"login":"pvary","id":19705742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzA1NzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19705742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary","html_url":"https://github.com/pvary","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-26T11:51:29Z","updated_at":"2021-02-26T11:51:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @shardulm94 and @marton-bod for the review!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/786600794/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/786639303","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/2277#issuecomment-786639303","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2277","id":786639303,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4NjYzOTMwMw==","user":{"login":"pvary","id":19705742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzA1NzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19705742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary","html_url":"https://github.com/pvary","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-26T13:11:25Z","updated_at":"2021-02-26T13:11:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@allenzhg: What catalog do you try to do?\r\nThe valid values are:\r\n- `hive` - HiveCatalog\r\n- `hadoop` - HadoopCatalog\r\n\r\nWhere do you issue the table building statement?

We need to do that so that we update the properties to reflect the user's intent. If we have a setting for a column, renaming the property to carry it through a column rename is preserving the user's intent. But if we update table properties then we are potentially losing what the user chose to do.\r\n\r\nFor example, what do we do when the sort field is removed and there is a metrics config property? We can't remove a `truncate[16]` setting because we don't know whether it was added when the field was added to the sort, or if it was specifically set by the table owner. Similarly, we have cases where the owner may set a field to `counts` and then add it to the sort. I think that the table owner's config should take precedence. So we don't replace the property, but how then does the owner signal that it should be defaulted instead? Last, how do we handle tables that currently have sort orders? If we base metrics on the current sort order then everything starts working automatically. If we don't, then we would need to trigger a commit to update the properties.\r\n\r\nEven if we don't pass the table around, I think we should definitely pass the sort order in to get the metrics config. It is probably not the time to refactor and pass the table, but we can pass the sort order like we do the other table config.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/786785988/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/786827216","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2266#issuecomment-786827216","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2266","id":786827216,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4NjgyNzIxNg==","user":{"login":"szehon-ho","id":20555759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTU1NzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20555759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho","html_url":"https://github.com/szehon-ho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-26T18:46:21Z","updated_at":"2021-02-26T18:46:21Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Thanks @rymurr  for the quick review, i will take a look next week at make the changes!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/786827216/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/786830890","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2276#issuecomment-786830890","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2276","id":786830890,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4NjgzMDg5MA==","user":{"login":"sunchao","id":506679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-26T18:52:45Z","updated_at":"2021-02-26T18:52:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I did something wrong with the split size configs -

I am convinced now.\r\nIf we have enough confidence that this feature will be useful, I am ok if we want to modify all places where we write.\r\n\r\nI took a look at how hard will it be to move to `Table` as that would simplify our life in the future. Since `BaseTable` uses a proxy for serializing, we only serialize `FileIO` and the metadata location. We will need to read the metadata file back on each executor. In addition, `FileIO` may contain a full Hadoop conf. That's why we broadcast `FileIO` and `EncryptionManager` in Spark. We could consider broadcasting `Table` instead of `FileIO` and `EncryptionManager`. However, we will still have to read the metadata file from each executor. Is that a big deal?\r\n\r\nI am fine either way.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/786855993/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
