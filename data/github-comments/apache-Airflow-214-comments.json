Not sure if you are aware of it but the problem is that you need to update DockerHub account rather than GitHub repo. The URL in docker-compose is link to this dockerhub repository : https://cloud.docker.com/repository/docker/airflowci/incubator-airflow-ci and it takes the name of the image from repository name in DockerHub.\r\n\r\nIn order to make it works, you'd have to create a new repository for 'airflowci' DockerHub user ( airflow-ci). I don't think you can rename incubator-airflow-ci repository (I have not found such option)- yoy need to copy configuration for automated build from incubator to the new repository (and eventually delete the old Dockerhub incubator-airflow-ci repository). No change in https://github.com/apache/airflow-ci github is needed.\r\n\r\nBTW. I am rather close to fixing all errors in the multi-stage docker #4938 and once this is merged, we won't need this dual-account/dual repos drama ;). All of this will be happening (automatically) via 'airflow' github repo and 'airflow' dockerhub user.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/478232914/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/478233172","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5005#issuecomment-478233172","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5005","id":478233172,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3ODIzMzE3Mg==","user":{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-30T10:39:16Z","updated_at":"2019-03-30T10:39:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks @Fokko :) Though for 1.10 we need to apply the fix on rbac and www trees.

I watched your Hangout last week and it was super interesting to see how you work and how Breeze nicely automates some of the stuff that now require a lot of \"wizardry\" and manual setup. I took the lesson and implemented some of the stuff that you pointed out during your hangout. And the current breeze is better than ever now:\r\n\r\n* run-test <TAB> autocomplete now also autocompletes full modules and Test Classes - so you can easily select whole module or Class rather than single tests\r\n\r\n* run-test now only initializes the database the first time it is started in the container. When you run it subsequent times it will skip database initialisation (similar to your workflow but automated). You can always add `--with-db-init` flag to re-run initialisation if you need. \r\n\r\n* run-test supports now direct auto-complete-able `--nocapture` flag so that you can run tests with ipdb. You can also pass any switches to nosetest via flags following `--`\r\n     For example `run-test tests.test_cli -- --nocapture --rednose` will work :).\r\n\r\n* ipdb is now added as requirement, so no need to add it manually.\r\n\r\n* I updated documentation and added chapters about debugging (both using ipdb and connecting to the IDE /IntelliJ debugger - including some screenshots and explanation). \r\n\r\nI hope you will find it going in the right direction. It will be much easier to onboard new people if we have all the stuff automated and do not require to know all the wizardry to make the integration tests work.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/478454382/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/478462835","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4898#issuecomment-478462835","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4898","id":478462835,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3ODQ2MjgzNQ==","user":{"login":"milton0825","id":6065051,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNjUwNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6065051?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825","html_url":"https://github.com/milton0825","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-01T07:13:01Z","updated_at":"2019-04-01T07:13:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@feng-tao

But we might be surprised by some incompatibilities. I'd say if we say we support 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 we should run tests on all of them. Maybe we should drop 3.5 compatibility officially ;) ? \r\n\r\nHere are some examples of nasty incompatibilities I encountered while working on Airflow:\r\n\r\n* There is different sorting order of dictionary keys (https://stackoverflow.com/a/40007169/516701) (it's an implementation detail in 3.6 but as of 3.7 you can start relying on it. ). I saw code that implicitly relied on maintaining inserting order - which would fail on 3.5, while it would work differently on 3.6 and 3.7. So I think 3.5 is a must. I caught it during code rewiew luckily, and we added unit test for it. \r\n\r\n* 3.7 has new reserved words (async/await) which is all too easy to be used as variable name. It's been a problem in the past in airflow, and might went'= unnoticed if we do not run 3.7 tests.\r\n\r\n* I had a code (related to json.decoding() of subprocess command output) that worked on 2.7 AND 3.6 but did not work on 3.5 (!!!!). It was a bit surprising but you can find details in https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4254/commits/22bea285c2cace4a60b96fca4ad077cc91124907  \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/478949332/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/478964303","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3851#issuecomment-478964303","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3851","id":478964303,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3ODk2NDMwMw==","user":{"login":"jomv1","id":48994990,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4OTk0OTkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48994990?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jomv1","html_url":"https://github.com/jomv1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jomv1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jomv1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jomv1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jomv1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jomv1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jomv1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jomv1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jomv1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jomv1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-02T11:59:43Z","updated_at":"2019-04-02T11:59:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I'm facing same problem.
