It created a situation where all the cli tests are in the core repo. So we cannot accept any cli changes because of a circular dependence we can't break easily when cli changes are also required. So for example if there is a cli change and accompanying test changes, the tests in the core repo will be incompatible with the cli version pulled from the cli repo. I think we need to continue building the cli from this local copy until such time when all the accompanying tests are moved to the cli repo.\r\n\r\nI agree with further inspecting the other repos.\r\nI think before we start using the two cli repos we need a better testing story.\r\nWe have two repos to deal with \r\n- https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-client-go\r\n- https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-cli\r\n\r\nFor both there should be tests on the repo, and travis integration that takes the source from the same repo and run tests that are located in the sam repo.\r\n\r\nAs a transition we should duplicate the tests from core to both, and evaluate which set goes where.\r\n\r\nAlso provide docs for a contributor on how to setup their dev environment and do testing locally\r\n\r\nI proposed we revert this change, and what we can do is introduce a mode for the cli ansible role, where we can pass a flag to do the new behavior to allow experimentation and integration into the other cli repos.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/308410151/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/308413817","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/2371#issuecomment-308413817","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2371","id":308413817,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwODQxMzgxNw==","user":{"login":"csantanapr","id":1094878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTQ4Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1094878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr","html_url":"https://github.com/csantanapr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-14T12:19:26Z","updated_at":"2017-06-14T12:19:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Some

I'll summarize them:\r\n\r\n1. the added overhead on the activation message in space means messages that were already working will no longer work in a production system for the same payload; this is a concern\r\n2. will need a test to ensure that whatever the desired invariant are from the sampling is actually being captured\r\n3. in addition to a test for the sampling itself, we need a test to confirm that when the sample rate is 0 (ie no tracing), the size of the activation message is not affected\r\n\r\nI have a general concern about accepting one-offs and deferring the refactoring. Who's committing to doing the refactoring? Further, as I noticed, in some deployments, this will not be enabled at all. So we are incurring additional overhead for some deployments without articulating the gains. I think we have to be extra vigilant on this point as we have more contributors now and more community partners and just today there was a discussion about just this PR and why the OpenTracing (http://opentracing.io/) is not used instead of a direct integration. \r\n\r\nI have only made a cursory pass over the code but if you want to pursue this in its current form, I think I and others will likely want to make a more critical pass over the actual code.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/308475467/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/308476957","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/2368#issuecomment-308476957","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2368","id":308476957,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwODQ3Njk1Nw==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-14T15:57:56Z","updated_at":"2017-06-14T15:57:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Glad you got it working.

Regarding fixing it, I really have no idea why it decided to work, so I'm not sure what I would patch. For now I think it can be closed, but I can try to recreate it in a new setup and see if changing the `./tools/macos/tweak-dockermachine.sh` script to remove the `DOCKER_TLS=auto` solves the issue from the start.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/308819657/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/308829536","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/2311#issuecomment-308829536","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2311","id":308829536,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwODgyOTUzNg==","user":{"login":"csantanapr","id":1094878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTQ4Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1094878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr","html_url":"https://github.com/csantanapr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-15T18:32:30Z","updated_at":"2017-06-15T18:33:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think we found a better way to handle this\r\nIncreasing the size of the runtime image is the wrong direction we want to go, I'm actually looking into decreasing the size of the nodejs image.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are trying to make it easier to add new kinds for the languages we already have in place.\r\nThis PR #2383 will take the list from group vars manifest in ansbile and docker pull those images into the invoker.\r\n\r\nThe way we can easily create an image that has a few packages more than the base nodejs, and be deploy in your environment, this would be something for operators to benefit, and then for users you would provide a new kind like `nodejs-acme:6` where this image extend `FROM` the base nodejs image but have more npm packages custom for acme.\r\n\r\nThere is a related PR #2112, that would allow users to use their own docker images that could extend one of the language ones and create actions with a docker image and a zip, not requiring the operator to pre-populate the images to the invokers.
