This will result in a managed ledger fenced error each time a property is set, forcing the topic to get closed. \r\n 3. Why do we need to re-read the metadata from store? We already have that metadata and its corresponding version in memory.\r\n\r\nFinally, from the API is not clear what happens if there are already some properties and I just want to add a new one.
