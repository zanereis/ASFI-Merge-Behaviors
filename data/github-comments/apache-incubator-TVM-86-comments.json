Currently, we actually have almost all of them, but one has to take a while to find a simple example for meta or fpga. **At least, we need a CPU only example.** For the employees from AI ASIC accelerator companies, lots of them do not have GPU and the platforms on their computer. If they want to try TVM simply without GPU, they have to eliminate cuda and so on to get an example to work.\r\n\r\n2. how to hack?\r\nllvm gives users the ability to generate IR from clang and also provides ways to output IR after each pass. Currently, I still do not know how many different IRs will be generated from TVM model to cuda (computation graph, halide like for loops, cuda)? Can we generate the textual presentation of the computation graph after graph optimization in nnvm or relay? I think it is better to have an example to show how to hack by adding options to a command (or adding print function in python).

sub-analyzer.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/472706966/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/472707188","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2775#issuecomment-472707188","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2775","id":472707188,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MjcwNzE4OA==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-14T05:14:46Z","updated_at":"2019-03-14T05:14:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks

discussions so far.  I think we want to de-couple the RFC into two components:\r\n\r\n- (1) Runtime data structure and related instructions \r\n   - Data structures set and primitive instruction (like Alloca) set a foundation for most of the implementations details, many of those are independent of the VM's implementation.\r\n- (2) Implementation: stack vm / register based vm / directly compile into AOT(LLVM)\r\n   - Most of the implementation will likely depend on the data structures and the control flow execution part can be relatively independent of implementation.\r\n- (3) Scheduling\r\n   - Scheduling layer, by itself, can again be somewhat independent of stack/register based implementation. If every invocation of the code can be again dispatched by an independent task scheduler dynamically as those in common deep learning frameworks.\r\n\r\nI would recommend we focus on discussing and agreeing on the item (1) since this is the most important thing in the short term. Having a stack-vm as a starting point is fine due to its simplicity as long as we have some good thoughts on scheduling. \r\n\r\n@jroesch would also be nice if you can separate the RFC into the three perspectives.

This simplifies the ISA because you don't have the addressing space/assignment of a register file. However, you also lose the ability to exploit concurrency between operators, as they are all serialize through the top two three positions of the stack.\r\n\r\nWhen you think of many computational graphs they tend to be trees of 'stuff', where the leave operands are independent. All that represents opportunities for the hardware to execute operators concurrently. \r\n\r\nIf you look at what a JVM JIT needs to do, it basically executes the stack program, extract the operands, assign them to registers and issue the associated instruction. To extract any concurrency, the JIT needs to unroll the stack instructions, which are a serialization constraint created purely by the VM: they are not present in the computational graph of the program.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/473058838/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/473061108","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2814#issuecomment-473061108","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2814","id":473061108,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MzA2MTEwOA==","user":{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-14T21:02:13Z","updated_at":"2019-03-14T21:02:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Closing in favor of #2817 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/473061108/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/473077486","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/2651#issuecomment-473077486","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2651","id":473077486,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MzA3NzQ4Ng==","user":{"login":"eqy","id":2239616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzk2MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2239616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy","html_url":"https://github.com/eqy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-14T21:46:27Z","updated_at":"2019-03-14T21:46:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ajtulloch Haha, I was about to say that we have independently discovered the same thing. There is some literature that seems to try some more complex (or efficient?) methods (e.g., https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05488) but I am not sure that the results are better than just plain old mean-squared error.\r\n@liangfu #2753 is a WIP to add part of the support for this; basically the remaining steps, at a high level are: \r\n[ ] profiling activation support (Relay makes this easy and I have an internal branch that does this)\r\n[ ] per-channel scales (needed for MobileNet, possibly DenseNet)\r\n\r\nThe second part is a bit more involved as it essentially requires setting up/inferring the number of scales we need for each operator and then tacking them to the graph. It seems the data-aware calibration method will also require some API changes as it will be done after a first version of the graph has already been constructed, as it requires profiling the intermediate activations (e.g., to compute L2/MSE).

A typical example would likely to be the following:\r\n\r\n``` python\r\ndef func_example(a):\r\n  \"\"\"This is Func example.\r\n\r\n  Parameters\r\n  ----------\r\n  a: str\r\n  arg a\r\n\r\n  Examples\r\n  --------\r\n  >>> a = A(p0=1, p1=2)\r\n  >>> b = func_example(a)\r\n  b = 1 + 2\r\n  \"\"\"\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/473130012/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/473135739","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/2810#issuecomment-473135739","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2810","id":473135739,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MzEzNTczOQ==","user":{"login":"kevinthesun","id":15520525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTIwNTI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15520525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinthesun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-15T02:29:02Z","updated_at":"2019-03-15T02:29:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Ravenwater

Most of the deep learning framework has extra asynchronous scheduling engine, that executes these instructions asynchronously based on dependencies. This essentially a \"unrolling\" approach. In the case of traditional vm, because the operational unit is scalar, performing such kind of execution can cause performance regression. In our case, such cost can be mitigated because each operation is tensor ops.\r\n\r\nRegardless of stack vs register based implementation, we always need to have a call stack for function calls, and because we need tail recursion optimizations in our case, perhaps stack vm's abstraction makes it relatively easy to do so.\r\n\r\nOne important benefit of the stack vm is that it is simple to implement and extend, such **simplicity** could out-weights a lot of things.\r\n\r\nFinally, since our high-level program is always relay, we do not have to perform all the optimizations like parallelization detection and distributed mapping at the level of the VM. Relay by itself is much closer to a computational graph form, and can be used for such high level analysis and transformation.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/473140909/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/473141659","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/2815#issuecomment-473141659","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2815","id":473141659,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MzE0MTY1OQ==","user":{"login":"MarisaKirisame","id":3397377,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzOTczNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3397377?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame","html_url":"https://github.com/MarisaKirisame","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-15T03:03:11Z","updated_at":"2019-03-15T03:03:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@wweic sounds good to me. @jroesch (private communication) dont want exception because it cause complication (IR, VM, concurrency, etc), and argue we should panic right now.
