I've modified `EC2ReservedNode` constructor to call parent constructor - 49e2f3bf55b9ef510e48c8c7174d7377f27e620a\n2. I've removed unused arguments from the `EC2ReservedNode` constructor method - 49e2f3bf55b9ef510e48c8c7174d7377f27e620a\n3. I've also passed `size` attribute to the `EC2ReservedNode` constructor. We can do this because `list_sizes` call is cheap (it doesn't result in HTTP request since sizes are stored locally in the module). - 11abec495e0125cf037e468b2dbed70d5254a055\n4. I've moved test from `NimbusTests` to `EC2Tests` class since this functionality is EC2 specific. I imagine you just looked for `list_nodes` tests and you accidentally put `list_reserved_nodes` test above it. - 1655e850a71cca1af35ece6f795aa44fa5029958\n5. I've renamed `list_reserved_nodes` method to `ex_list_reserved_nodes`. Sorry if I've confused you with \"you can drop the ex prefix from the class name\" comment. We still use `ex_` prefix, but only for method and argument names.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/31134914/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/31136505","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/126#issuecomment-31136505","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/126","id":31136505,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMTM2NTA1","user":{"login":"sankroh","id":34296,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0Mjk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34296?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sankroh","html_url":"https://github.com/sankroh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sankroh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sankroh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sankroh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sankroh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sankroh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sankroh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sankroh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sankroh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sankroh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-12-23T18:46:26Z","updated_at":"2013-12-23T18:46:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Sorry for the late response, totally forgot about this...

It is something I was also thinking a lot in the past and I think it's a step in the right direction.\n\nTo put the whole thing into perspective for the other people who might view this pull request. This pull request aims to solve a problem with the \"dynamic\" nature of Python which makes it hard to enforce interfaces and other things. All of this causes inconsistent API and confusing to the user.\n\nCurrently, most of this stuff is enforced manually (during code reviews) which obviously doesn't scale and it's prone to errors.\n\n```\n<off topic>\nWaiting for someone to come here and troll and say we should re-write the whole thing in a statically typed language with a better support for interfaces :P\n</off topic>\n```\n\nNow some high-level comments about the whole thing:\n1. I think this tool should have a concept of rules (or whatever we end up calling it), similar to pep8, pyflakes, pylint and other lint tools. You have already described a couple of good rules in the description.\n2. Fixing existing violations will probably be quite painful and take a while. I think a good start would be to make this tool solid and enable and strictly enforce it for all the new contributions.\n3. Yes, I hate drivers and methods which (ab)use kwargs. It's an ugly artifact from the first releases which should be fixed.\n4. How should we call this thing? It's not really a linter. libcloud-interface-enforcer or something? :)\n\nI also plan to add some more comments about the implementation later on.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/31284745/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/31292333","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/208#issuecomment-31292333","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/208","id":31292333,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMjkyMzMz","user":{"login":"Jc2k","id":11544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k","html_url":"https://github.com/Jc2k","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-12-28T07:43:41Z","updated_at":"2013-12-28T07:43:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"My reading of this is that `only_allocated` shows addresses that are allocated, but not associated.

The reason for that is that there are some other drivers which also use this name. On top of that, renaming the method also breaks backward compatibility. Or if we decide to add a wrapper for the old method, this means we now need to support two methods until we fully deprecate it. None of this is ideal.\n\nI know there is some confusion and no clear guidelines on when to use destroy and when to use delete. Most of the old APIs use destroy (e.g. `destroy_node`) and the new ones use delete.\n\nI will try to find some time in the near future and publish some clear guidelines on the method naming.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/31614535/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/31619399","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/217#issuecomment-31619399","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/217","id":31619399,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNjE5Mzk5","user":{"login":"cderamus","id":3099339,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTkzMzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3099339?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cderamus","html_url":"https://github.com/cderamus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cderamus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cderamus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cderamus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cderamus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cderamus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cderamus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cderamus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cderamus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cderamus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-01-05T23:38:25Z","updated_at":"2014-01-05T23:38:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ah okay, my mistake for not going through the other drivers to validate that before proposing the change. \n\nNo worries about the guidelines, it was only about five minutes of work :).

We also need to test this and make sure it works if you send `Signature`, `AWSAccessKeyId`, etc. via query parameter and `X-Amz-Security-Token` via headers.\n\nEdit: While we are at it, it would also be good to check it they might support sending this value via query parameters as well (I quickly glanced over the documentation and I could see this value being sent via headers).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/32501862/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
