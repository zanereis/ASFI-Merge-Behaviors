Turns out the SQLState returned by Postgres (`57000`) is not part of the SQL standard.  [Here](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/errcodes-appendix.html) is the list of possible error codes in Postgresql.\r\n\r\nI think the current PR is a step in the right direction, but limiting the support to a handful of standard SQL states will not address every use-case (read database vendor).  Since the JDBCCatalog is written to work with any database supported by JDBC, we need to provide a configuration option to extend the list of SQLState related to retryable connection exceptions.\r\n\r\nThe configurable list would be vendor specific since for example `57000` is a retryable exception for Postgresql, but maybe not for Oracle or MySQL.  SQLStates are not vendor assigned, so they can be reused.\r\n\r\n@amogh-jahagirdar , do you think it would make sense to add a configurable option for a list of retryable connection exception codes?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1591804604/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1591972748","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/6512#issuecomment-1591972748","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/6512","id":1591972748,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85e45OM","user":{"login":"krvikash","id":11939923,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTM5OTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11939923?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/krvikash","html_url":"https://github.com/krvikash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krvikash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krvikash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krvikash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krvikash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krvikash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krvikash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krvikash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krvikash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krvikash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-14T20:56:29Z","updated_at":"2023-06-14T20:56:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"(rebased with master)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1591972748/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1592080049","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/6512#issuecomment-1592080049","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/6512","id":1592080049,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85e5Tax","user":{"login":"krvikash","id":11939923,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTM5OTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11939923?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/krvikash","html_url":"https://github.com/krvikash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krvikash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krvikash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krvikash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krvikash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krvikash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krvikash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krvikash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krvikash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krvikash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-14T22:33:16Z","updated_at":"2023-06-14T22:33:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @nastra | @ajantha-bhat for the review.

think one way to approach this problem (which we are also running into) is to expose a new commit API that doesn't automatically refresh the table metadata. This would allow clients to rely on the atomic snapshot CAS to also synchronize the state changes to custom properties (whether it's on the table or the snapshot). This is a very desirable capability since it allows us to update in one single atomic operation both the current snapshot and the properties of that snapshot.\r\n\r\nIn our particular case, we would like to store some kafka offsets as part of the snapshot properties. Even if we had a single writer, there is always a case where we may end up with two writer (for example due to a network partition) and in that case, we don't want the last writer's state to overwrite the first one. We would like to use the CAS nature of iceberg as the last resort to detect concurrent writes.\r\n\r\nAnother way to think about this is that each iceberg committer is moving the state of a table from `state-A` to `state-B`. Most clients do not care about what `state-A` is. All they care about is that it gets moved to `state-B`. So if another client gets in between and moves `state-A` to `state-C`, the first client will happily commit by doing the the implicit refresh (which will pick up `state-C`) and then doing the commit effectively moving the system from `state-C` to `state-B`.\r\n\r\nThere are cases where clients want to be explicit about that state transition. For example, because there are some attributes in `state-A` that they use to determine what `state-B` looks like (ie, the watermark example in the original description or kafka offsets in our case).\r\n\r\nAnother argument for not doing the refresh is that it adds extra latency (due to the retrieval of the current snapshot). In the single writer case, it is not needed since the common case is that there would be no conflicts and the writer always has the latest snapshot.\r\n\r\nI think providing the caller the option to decide on whether they care about the original state or not when they do a commit is a very powerful capability. It also seems like a rather straightforward change that can be applied in a backward compatible way.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1593653436/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1593748070","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/7326#issuecomment-1593748070","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/7326","id":1593748070,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85e_qpm","user":{"login":"flyrain","id":1322359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjIzNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1322359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyrain","html_url":"https://github.com/flyrain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyrain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyrain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyrain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyrain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyrain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyrain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyrain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyrain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyrain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-15T21:29:47Z","updated_at":"2023-06-15T21:29:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"cc @szehon-ho ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1593748070/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1593755776","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/7802#issuecomment-1593755776","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/7802","id":1593755776,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85e_siA","user":{"login":"maswin","id":5331361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMzEzNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5331361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maswin","html_url":"https://github.com/maswin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maswin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maswin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maswin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maswin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maswin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maswin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maswin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maswin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maswin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-15T21:38:23Z","updated_at":"2023-06-15T21:38:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> I am not sure this will compile and run with Hive2\r\n\r\n[DefaultHiveMetaHook](https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/branch-2.3/metastore/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/metastore/DefaultHiveMetaHook.java) was introduced in Hive-2.X , so there shouldn't be any issue. \r\n\r\nThe problem I could think of is backward compatibility.
