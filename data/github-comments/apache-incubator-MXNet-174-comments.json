I am not an expert in deep learning (I am still trying to be :) ).  Here are some suggestions:\r\n\r\nFirst, your result seems not good enough, even in `sync` model. Normally, it should be more than 96% with default parameters. Use `export PS_VERBOSE=1; your current command` to print more details. (`PS_VERBOSE=2` will print more)\r\n\r\nSecond, you can debug locally on your machine, with 'local' model (But you have to kill process manually when they go wrong). The basic workflow is the same as `yarn`, but run locally in different processes. Aforementioned `export PS_VERBOSE=1` also works in `local` model.\r\n\r\nAlso, as mentioned by MXNet members in #5422, distributed training is meaningless in small datasets.

\r\n\r\n**First of all, all subprocesses or working nodes are launched with nearly the same command and parameters. So, how do they make sure they act just like we want?** \r\nThe answer is the MXNet using `envs` to specify roles and other parameters, e.g., `env['DMLC_ROLE'] = 'scheduler'` means launch a `scheduler` process.\r\n\r\n**Let's go back and see the whole workflow.** \r\n\r\n1. When you are submitting tasks with `tools/launch.py`, MXNet will redirect it to a specific script such as `ssh.py` according to your `--launch parameter`.  Let's use ssh as an example.\r\n2. Then, **all** these scripts will call `submit` defined in  `tracker.py`. In most cases, this submit function will try to init and launch a `PSTracker` (actually, it just write a few envs, e.g, `env['DMLC_ROLE'] = 'scheduler'`, and run the command you give). \r\n3. Then, it stores scheduler's **IP and port to `envs` ( `DMLC_PS_ROOT_URI ` and `DMLC_PS_ROOT_PORT `)**, such that `worker` and `server` can communicate or register with `scheduler`.\r\n4. `ssh_submit` function in `ssh.py` is called by `tracker.py` (remember you have passed a function to tracker.submit). Note that envs are passed to this submit function.  This function will try to launch `worker` and `server` with given command and `envs`.  For worker nodes, their roles are  `env['DMLC_ROLE'] = 'woker'`.
