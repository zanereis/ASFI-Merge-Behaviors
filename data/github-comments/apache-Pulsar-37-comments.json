Because on both sides we have Pulsar brokers that talk native Pulsar protocol, we can achieve a lot of efficiencies.\r\n\r\nRegarding the changes for this PR, the consensus has been to focus the efforts on a single \"connector\" framework, named \"Pulsar-IO\" which is scheduled for 2.1 release. \r\n\r\nThe work on Pulsar-IO framework address the problem of getting data in & out of Pulsar in the simplest possible way from a user standpoint: \r\n * No need to write code, just specify the configuration for sources and sinks\r\n * No need to \"run\" the connector, the system takes care of managing the connectors runtime\r\n\r\nIf you're interested, you can checkout the work in progress: https://github.com/apache/incubator-pulsar/tree/master/pulsar-io .

The bookie that went down has more than 300 GB of ledgers data.\r\nIn that cluster, we have 20 bookies running bookkeeper 4.3.1.91-yahoo. Each bookie server runs in its own docker container, and another container in the same machines runs autorecovery. When autorecovery process is replicating, it affects bookie's response times because they share resources. We are planning to create a dedicated cluster for autorecovery, but that's going to take a while.\r\nIn our current situation, we would like to regenerate the list of underreplicated ledgers, to avoid the replication process because they are already replicated to 3 bookies.\r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/393893112/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/393901095","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/1890#issuecomment-393901095","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/1890","id":393901095,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MzkwMTA5NQ==","user":{"login":"srkukarni","id":2530234,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzAyMzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2530234?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni","html_url":"https://github.com/srkukarni","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-01T14:39:01Z","updated_at":"2018-06-01T14:39:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@sijie
