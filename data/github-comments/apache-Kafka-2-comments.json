pull request doesn't merge cleanly anymore, can you please close it?\n\nSorry for not replying to this earlier, but pull requests are not currently monitored as the Kafka project uses JIRA and Review Board for contributions. There is a plan to change this and we would like to close stale PRs before we start. Unfortunately we can't do it ourselves (a JIRA needs to be filed with Apache Infra) so your help is appreciated.\n\nIf this change is still relevant, please see http://kafka.apache.org/contributing.html.

If you mean kafka security work which allows kafka server to run with a keytab and authenticates client connecting to kafka then that is not needed for this.\n\nFor supporting this, zookeeper server needs to be configured to support security.  \n\nIn addition, Kafka brokers needs to start with -Djava.security.auth.login.config=/path/to/client/jaas/file.conf where file.conf will need to have following section:\n\nClient { // used for zookeeper connection\n   com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required\n   useKeyTab=true\n   keyTab=\"/etc/security/keytabs/kafka.service.keytab\"\n   storeKey=true\n   useTicketCache=false\n   serviceName=\"zookeeper\"\n   principal=\"kafka/host1.kafka.com@EXAMPLE.COM\";\n};\n\nJust by doing this we can assure all zookeeper nodes are secured with acls. So if you meant the second option where a keytab is configured to access zookeeper , then yes we need that. Another option is to use digest by specifying the following and in this case no keytabs are required:\n\nClient {\n       org.apache.zookeeper.server.auth.DigestLoginModule required\n       username=\"bob\"\n       password=\"bobsecret\";\n};\n\nI haven't tested the digest approach but don't see why it wont work. Will update the PR once I have tested with digests too. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/124229239/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/124251442","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/94#issuecomment-124251442","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/94","id":124251442,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNDI1MTQ0Mg==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-23T22:05:42Z","updated_at":"2015-07-23T22:05:42Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[kafka-trunk-git-pr #34](https://builds.apache.org/job/kafka-trunk-git-pr/34/) SUCCESS\nThis pull request looks good\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/124251442/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/124255801","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/95#issuecomment-124255801","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/95","id":124255801,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNDI1NTgwMQ==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-23T22:31:26Z","updated_at":"2015-07-23T22:31:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[kafka-trunk-git-pr #35](https://builds.apache.org/job/kafka-trunk-git-pr/35/) SUCCESS\nThis pull request looks good\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/124255801/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/124327597","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/95#issuecomment-124327597","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/95","id":124327597,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNDMyNzU5Nw==","user":{"login":"ewencp","id":47366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp","html_url":"https://github.com/ewencp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-24T04:48:18Z","updated_at":"2015-07-24T04:48:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1.
