So, for some reason we were creating Uber-jar with shadow plugin which contained Flink libraries including `org.apache.flink:flink-streaming-java`. This was not necessary and we can get rid of it and this solves the problem on our side.\r\n\r\nSo the scenario is: \r\n * Someone tries to create Uber-jar containing `org.apache.flink:flink-streaming-java`,\r\n * While using gradle's `shadowJar` plugin, manifests of dependencies get overwritten, \r\n * The code \r\n```\r\nDataStream.class.getPackage().getImplementationVersion();\r\n```\r\nreturns `null` and `NullPointerException` is thrown when doing `EnvironmentContext.put(\"engine-version\", FlinkPackage.version());` \r\n\r\nThe bug is nasty to understand because one does have `DataStream.class` on the classpath but the manifest with `implementationVersion` is missing. And the only thing observed on the top is `NullPointerException`.\r\n\r\nSo, if you don't mind, I could prepare a PR which prevents putting `null` in `org.apache.iceberg.flink.FlinkEnvironmentContext#init` and throws more meaningful Exception. It would have been even better if you were able to find flink version some other way. Alternatively, we can close the issue if it so rare and uncommon to happen elsewhere.

See https://orc.apache.org/specification/ORCv1/#string-char-and-varchar-columns\r\n> \r\n> One way to verify this would be to run `orc-tools` command on the generated ORC files. See https://orc.apache.org/docs/java-tools.html. Take a look at the [encoding for the columns](https://orc.apache.org/docs/java-tools.html#:~:text=Encoding%20column%2014%3A-,DICTIONARY_V2,-%5B2%5D%0A%20%20%20%20Encoding%20column), if dictionary encoding is used it would be DICTIONARY or DICTIONARY_V2, if not it would be DIRECT or DIRECT_V2.\r\n\r\n@shardulm94  Thank you for your answer. I have checked the file encoding of both and they are DICTIONARY_V2 or DIRECT_V2(less 10,000 rows).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1614040223/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
