I've updated the patch accordingly, mod some comments inline:\n\n> There is some whitespace before an EOL that can be removed. For example, in in the header of eclipse-format.xml.\n\nThis is added automatically before the line break to respect the space before the indentation in the next line. I think it's ok to keep that. \nI formatted the xml files because some had weird indentation, but the idea is that it's just more readable.\n\n> The header of all the xml files (pom.xml in samoa-api, samoa-instances, log4j.xml, etc..) was changed.

And why is there some space at the beginning of the second line?\n\nThis is because text in comments currently wraps at 80. I changed to 120.\n\n> In AMRulesRegressorProcessor.java there is a piece of commented pseudocode to express the algorithm that serves as documentation. This patch makes it very hard to read. Can we avoid that somehow?\n>  Can we avoid reformatting those pieces?\n\nSimplest way is to disable formatting for block comments (starting with /*) and rewrite the pseudo-code\n\n> The same happens in LocalStatisticsProcessor.\n\nI don't see what the problem is with formatting comments in that class. There is a piece of code that is commented but it looks like it's unused code rather than documentation.\n\n> Some reformatting is pretty weird.

We have tested several tasks form our side with this version (eg. prequential evaluation with vertical hoeffding trees) and it seems to be running accurately.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-samoa/issues/comments/94555179/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-samoa/issues/comments/95484805","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-samoa/pull/11#issuecomment-95484805","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-samoa/issues/11","id":95484805,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk1NDg0ODA1","user":{"login":"gdfm","id":703859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMzg1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/703859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gdfm","html_url":"https://github.com/gdfm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gdfm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gdfm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gdfm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gdfm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gdfm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gdfm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gdfm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gdfm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gdfm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-23T08:07:00Z","updated_at":"2015-04-23T08:07:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks

Flink batch is using managed memory for its operations, flink streaming uses unmanaged memory only. By default the value is set to 0.7, which leaves not much memory for streaming.

The irony is that the greater the speed the slower the whole computation gets by time  since more and more attribute events are sent to the local statistics processors with higher rate, the more updates the model aggregator gets back. \n\nThe average processing delay (in num of flatten instances processed by the aggregator between sending a process event and receiving the respective local statistics) is ~2k instances for Flink and around 400k instances for Storm. Also in Storm the aggregator continuously broadcasts ~100-200 attribute messages to local processors on average while Flink broadcasts ~2100 attribute messages due to the rate it gets results back I assume. These are collected locally on each component and there was no message duplication. \nSince you worked on the algorithm, do you find this behavior reasonable?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-samoa/issues/comments/100484501/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-samoa/issues/comments/100484804","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-samoa/pull/11#issuecomment-100484804","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-samoa/issues/11","id":100484804,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwMDQ4NDgwNA==","user":{"login":"senorcarbone","id":858078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1ODA3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/858078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/senorcarbone","html_url":"https://github.com/senorcarbone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senorcarbone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senorcarbone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senorcarbone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senorcarbone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senorcarbone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senorcarbone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senorcarbone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senorcarbone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senorcarbone/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-09T13:33:38Z","updated_at":"2015-05-09T13:33:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I also tried adding a 2sec sleep on the local flink processors to delay their results back and the algorithm finished in 12sec with less (57%) accuracy.

Given that the feedback loop in Flink is faster, the number of attempts to split should increase.\nThis is expected, but the number of such attempts is upper bounded by the ones tried on the Local engine, where there is no delay between request of the split criterion and response by the local statistics.\n\nWe already have some flow control to regulate the rate of ingestion in PrequentialEvaluation. I'll play a bit with it to see what happens.\nWhen you put the 2 seconds delay in the Flink Processors, what happens (I guess) is that the whole data streams through a very rough, sub-optimal version of the tree. So it's very fast, but the precision drops considerably because of the artificial limit on the number of split

thanks @gdfm! Will you merge from local [branch](https://github.com/gdfm/incubator-samoa/tree/SAMOA-16)? Mind that it is missing some last commits. I will close the PR once everything is merged.\n\nOn a slightly related note, we ran some experiments today on the new stable streaming api that will be released soon that contains many good fixes and additions. The VHT experiment mentioned above now takes approximately around 80sec for 1m instances since filters are properly chained, making input ingestion much faster so that it catches up with local processors. You can find the branch with the patch [here](https://github.com/senorcarbone/incubator-samoa/tree/releasepatch). Special thanks go to @gyfora for fixing chaining in iterations!  \n\nI will create a new PR once we have a stable
