This is very interesting. I have a few questions\r\n1. Does the dynamic forms here mean more control flow (like if condition and for loop)\r\n2. In case 2, If the markdown interpreter paragraph does not depends on the spark interpreter paragraph, we can execute them parallelly rather than sequentially. \r\n3. I think the most important thing of workflow is to define the DAG (dependency between paragraphs). Your idea is to run the paragraphs programmatically. Would it be more intuitive to just define the DAG (Directed acyclic graph), and let the framework to run the dag automatically. \r\ne.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\nval flow = new JobFlow(noteId)\r\nval note = z.getNote(noteId)\r\nval p1 = z.getParagraph(pid1)\r\nval p2 = z.getParagraph(pid2)\r\nval p3 = z.getParagraph(pid3)\r\np3.addDependency(p2)\r\np2.addDependency(p1)\r\n// run p1, p2, p3 sequentially\r\nflow.add(p1).add(p2).add(p3).run()\r\n``` \r\n4. Currently we use noteId and paragraphId, but I think these are not readable.

According to [SparkSubmit.scala](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/SparkSubmit.scala#L286-L292) it seems like adding resolved maven package path to `--py-files`. Could you check it? (pyspark-cassandra jar includes some py files.)\r\n\r\n3. If you run the code below, it download packages and add it to `py-files` so that you can import pyspark-cassandra in python shell. \r\n\r\n```sh\r\n// used spark 1.6.2\r\n\r\n./bin/pyspark --packages com.datastax.spark:spark-cassandra-connector_2.10:1.6.2,TargetHolding:pyspark-cassandra:0.3.5 --exclude-packages org.slf4j:slf4j-api\r\n\r\n>>> import pyspark_cassandra\r\n>>>\r\n```\r\n\r\nConsidering `(2)` and `(3)`, we can conclude that `--packages` option download some jars and add them to `py-files` even in pyspark for some jar files including python files. So why do you think?\r\n\r\n> Spark doesn't support specifying python packages throught --packages, the correct usage is to use --py-files.\r\n\r\n4. Why zeppelin cannot use `--package` option to download pyspark-cassandra even spark can do that. It's not a bug of zeppelin?\r\n\r\n>  but the issue here is not due to zeppelin bug, \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/270048096/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/270048309","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1799#issuecomment-270048309","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1799","id":270048309,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MDA0ODMwOQ==","user":{"login":"zjffdu","id":164491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu","html_url":"https://github.com/zjffdu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-03T03:49:40Z","updated_at":"2017-01-03T03:49:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"BTW, in the first phase we can provide the high-level framework to allow user to call it programmatically, And in the second phase, it would be better to allow user to do it though drag & drop in UI.

I feel like this kind of paragraph execution control shall be handeled by the core framework based on settings for each paragraph within the notebook.\r\n\r\nAdditionally: In some places within the discussion the implementation of that feature on interpreter level was mentioned. It is not clear to me why the notebook workflow definition feature shall be reimplemented in different interpreters in different ways. Instead the internals of a notebook are of no interest when it is executed within a workflow - all that matters is success or failure and a definition at the workflow level what shall happen in case of a failure. So from my point of view the notebook workflow feature should also be implemented in the core code independently from the different interpreters available.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/270070106/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/270078954","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1833#issuecomment-270078954","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1833","id":270078954,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MDA3ODk1NA==","user":{"login":"AhyoungRyu","id":10060731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYwNzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10060731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu","html_url":"https://github.com/AhyoungRyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-03T09:46:48Z","updated_at":"2017-01-03T09:50:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@astroshim @Leemoonsoo I guess the issue that I told in the above is not a matter of Shell intp itself.

\r\nThank you for your opinion.\r\nI have a question.\r\nIn fact, there is a little confusion in the sense of `wait`.\r\nIt is difficult to understand because it is a mixture of parallel and sequential.\r\nIf you enter the code in one paragraph, the paragraph will be executed sequentially from the top.\r\nIf so, you have to wait under the z.wait function, even if it is declared in parallel.\r\nWhich of the following does it mean?\r\n\r\nCase 1\r\n```\r\nZ.run (\"paragraph\") // parallel run (currently support)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nZ.runForWait (\"paragraphID-A\") // waiting for job of paragraphID-A, finished or error\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr\r\n\r\nCase 2\r\n```\r\nZ.run (\"paragraphID-A\") // parallel run (currently support)\r\nZ.wait (\"paragraphID-A\") // waiting for job finished or error\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd would you please more explain regarding `cancel`?\r\n\"cancel\" mean is \"next job

\r\nI think a picture and some pseudocode tells more than thousand words, so I created one.\r\n\r\nAlso: I'm only talking about the use case to ensure a certain sequence of paragraph executions when runAll is called for the notebook. If you explicitely call z.run(paragraphId) within a certain notebook after runAll() was called, you propably execute those paragraphs twice.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to ensure a certain sequence of paragraph execution after runAll() was issued is to make the paragraphs wait for the one they depend on to finish. \r\n\r\nLets say we have three paragraphs. \r\nThe first one is necessary to prepare the data and define temporary tables. The second and third paragraphs depend on that data, so it does not make sense to execute them before paragraph 1 finished.\r\nSince the last two paragraphs are in status \"running\" and wait in parallel for the first paragraph to finish, they will be executed in parallel.\r\n\r\nPlease see the picture \r\n![wait pseudocode](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/22585000/21642718/903ba9be-d284-11e6-8efb-958adca7861a.jpg)\r\n\r\nFrom my point of view this would be the easiest way for a ZeppelinUser to ensure a certain sequence of paragraph execution including control which paragraphs are executed in parallel. \r\n\r\nTo answer your particular question: \r\nz.wait(idx) will cause the execution of the current paragraph to be aborted (cancelled) if the paragraph execution it was checking finished with an error.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/270364635/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/270370566","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1799#issuecomment-270370566","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1799","id":270370566,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MDM3MDU2Ng==","user":{"login":"zjffdu","id":164491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu","html_url":"https://github.com/zjffdu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-04T13:31:33Z","updated_at":"2017-01-04T13:31:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I agree with @rasehorn that workflow execution should be done in a high level framework. User just need to define the workflow (specify the dependencies between paragraphs).  I also paste one image to illustrate my current idea. In the following screenshot, we have 4 paragraphs, paragraph 1 needs to run first and paragraph 2,3,4 can be run concurrently after paragraph 1. So on each paragraph's top right area, we can allow user to specify this paragraph's dependencies. Here, paragraph_1 has no dependencies, and paragraph 2,3,4 depends on paragraph 1. After the workflow is defined (dependencies are specified), we can click the button on the top right of the note to run all the paragraphs on the note.  We could also provide rest api for run this whole note.
