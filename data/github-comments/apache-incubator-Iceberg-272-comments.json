you tried with more executor memory? I know the ORC Writer currently doesn't roll over so you could just be buffering a very large spark task before writing.\r\n\r\nIf the issue is solved with more executor memory, you could either keep that setting or attempt to break the write tasks into smaller chunks.

Also i took a brief look at some other projects like Parquet/Spark/Flink/Hive, and didn't see .java-version there.  I think this made sense before when Spark 2 was not built without java8, but now that has been removed and don't see a strong reason to default Iceberg to a specific java version overriding the user's default.

First, I assume we want to do this, to reduce the impact for user (keep gzip for old table and use zstd for new tables).  If that's the case, the questions:\r\n\r\n1.  Should we change TableMetadata constructor to set these two compression table properties for new TableMetadata?   https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/8299#discussion_r1294836281   \r\n  * Currently changing each catalog risks missing this change in custom catalog.\r\n  * But TableMetadata is public API and it may be strange to have new instances default with 2 properties.  But then again, maybe this is a good direction and we should start returning with other default table property as well (which is a way for us to start persisting the defaults).\r\n2. Should we just have two compression constants (DEFAULT and NEW_TABLE_DEFAULT) and not have to persist GZIP explicitly in SnapshotProducer?  Then, the only change would be making createTable persist ZSTD default. \r\n https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/8299#discussion_r1294839051  \r\n *  Its less intrusive code in SnapshotProducer, and doesnt change a public constant.  But it just looks a bit weird to have two defaults.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1679605105/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1679608861","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/8299#issuecomment-1679608861","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/8299","id":1679608861,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85kHMwd","user":{"login":"szehon-ho","id":20555759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTU1NzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20555759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho","html_url":"https://github.com/szehon-ho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-15T21:01:21Z","updated_at":"2023-08-15T21:01:47Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@rdblue @nastra @jackye1995 @stevenzwu @danielcweeks , could you guys take a look?
