top of the shaping issue, the other issue is it's not entirely clear what the gradient for a dynamic k would be (or what would make one useful). I would recommend the following architecture, or something like it, to instead get the effect you want. It has the nice property that the function has a bit of burliness around the edges which lets the gradients \"see\" whether it's useful to expand or contract k.\r\n\r\nFirst, for your topk function, set its k to always be the maximum selection size you're willing to allow (we'll \"softly\" select a smaller k next)\r\n\r\nNext you want to gate the values of the selected k, which means we want to multiply it by a vector with values between 0 and 1 so that only some of the values get \"let through.\" Furthermore, the gate vector should have a monotonically decreasing property as you go further down the k elements and we want it fairly sharp so most elements are near the value 1 or 0. We want this because if the bottom k - k2 gate values are effectively zero and the top k2 gate values are effectively one, then you have an effective dynamic top k2 parameter.\r\n\r\nSo the question is how do you generate such a gate vector that is differentiable on some parameter that affects k2? Here is one way.\r\n\r\n-Create a constant inds, which is a vector with the value [0, 1, 2, ... k-1] (e.g., what an arange function would produce).\r\n\r\n-Create a scalar variable k_alt and broadcast it to size k.\r\n\r\n-Create a constant \"sharpness\" weight, w (choose its value as you desire)\r\n\r\n-Set your gate vector to the be the result of sigmoid(w * (k_alt - inds))\r\n\r\nThe output of that sigmoid will produce a monotonically decreasing vector from 1 to 0. Increasing w will push most of the values near 1 or 0 with the transition from 1 to zero happening over few indices. decreasing w will \"smear\" the values a bit more and cause the transition from near 1 to near zero happen over more indices. \r\n\r\nImportantly, as the continuous k_alt parameter is increased, more of the k instances pass through the gate (more values near 1) and as k_alt decreases, fewer of the k instances pass through the gate (more values near zero).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/288235690/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/288239656","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/5509#issuecomment-288239656","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/5509","id":288239656,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4ODIzOTY1Ng==","user":{"login":"kevinthesun","id":15520525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTIwNTI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15520525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinthesun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-21T22:30:21Z","updated_at":"2017-03-21T22:31:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It seems that decide_slice function doesn't get correct batch_size from dataIter:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmajor_axis = [DataDesc.get_batch_axis(x.layout) for x in data_shapes]\r\n\r\n        for (name, shape), axis in zip(data_shapes, major_axis):\r\n            if axis == -1:\r\n                continue\r\n\r\n            batch_size = shape[axis]\r\n```\r\nThis batch_size is 50, which is generated from dataIter.
