I'd suggest using the hocon format across all configuration. The reason is that if someone builds software where Pulsar is only one of the components using Typesafe Config, they can single hocon file for all their components. We can keep the properties _look and feel_ but, at least, I'd suggest prefixing all settings with `pulsar.` to give them a namespace.\n\nAs for having to know the property names, yes, this is slightly inconvenient but, I think, you are looking from the perspective of unit tests. Preferably, all configuration variants would come as a separate `.conf` file. Combined with a `reference.conf`, everything is covered. However, if that is not enough, we can always implement a builder which would construct the necessary properties. The base is what it is, how config properties are constructed, we can change that to a friendlier looking version.\n\nShall I come up with a full
