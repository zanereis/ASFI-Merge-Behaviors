We also know the model won't likely support multimaps with endpoints in the future. We could choose to make this change, inverting the UI element to showing more detail as opposed to less, eventhough we know the constraints of this.\n\nIf we did something like this, we should explicitly agree. For example, multiple people. When it gets to implementation, we should make the UI element consistent, either by emulating the style of annotation rows, or changing the style of annotation rows. For this reason, we should be careful to review pull requests carefully. Ex. Incomplete screen shots can hide inconsistency.\n\n### Make it easier to fork the UI\n\nThe UI no longer has any scala dependency etc. This particular change is not the only one that sites may want to customize.

When we work in such a model, it means we can delay loaded topics like this until they become more widely requested.\n\n### your idea here\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/219197308/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/219199313","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/1114#issuecomment-219199313","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1114","id":219199313,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxOTE5OTMxMw==","user":{"login":"yurishkuro","id":3523016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MjMwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3523016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro","html_url":"https://github.com/yurishkuro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-14T04:08:51Z","updated_at":"2016-05-14T04:08:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"this PR is unrelated to that discussion.
