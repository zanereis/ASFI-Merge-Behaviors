We observe that the two use cases operate on disjoint subsets of rows. `INSERT INTO` default values operate on rows where the column _exists_ in the schema, and schema evolution default values operate on rows where the column _does not exist_ in the schema. Therefore, we can discuss each separately.\r\n\r\nTo start, we can discuss the schema evolution use case as the sole one to simplify the discussion (we will relax this assumption later). In fact, unlike traditional database engines, which allow `INSERT INTO` that references a subset of columns, compute engines in the data lake do not commonly support inserting rows with missing values. In most cases, Hive, Trino, and Spark will throw an error if the `INSERT INTO` statement does not specify values for all columns. If we go by this assumption (for now), it means that: A column’s default value does not matter for subsequent inserts. It only matters for previous inserts when the column did not exist in the table in the first place. So we can have the following events throughout the lifecycle of a table:\r\n\r\n1. **Table creation:** default value does not matter for all columns defined as part of the table creation.\r\n2. **Adding a column to an existing table and defining a default value for it at the same time:** Default value affects the rows that are present at the time of this event (i.e., adding the column and introducing the default value). When reading those rows, the default value will be used. Let us call this set of rows R1.\r\n3. **Altering the default value (to d2) of an existing column that has a default value (d1):** The same rows R1 that were assigned the default value d1, will now be assigned d2. Nothing else changes. Rows added after R1 are not affected by d1 or d2.\r\n4. **Rewrite:** the current default value is used for rewriting R1, and the default value will now be materialized. Subsequent default value changes no longer affect R1 as well (or the subset of rewritten rows from R1). If all rows are rewritten, we are back to the “table creation” state.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo putting the \"`INSERT INTO` that references a subset of columns” use case aside,  semantics of default values can be clear:\r\n\r\n- It is safe to introduce them and change them. The current default will always be used for the rows missing the respective column, until the first rewrite.\r\n\r\nNow, to cover the `INSERT INTO` use case, just in case it becomes a common one (e.g., Hive 3  is adding support as Shenoda mentions above), the behavior in this case can be materializing the default values for the rows that are part of this `INSERT `since the statement occurs on _existing columns_.

specific flink API.  So the flink artifacts deployed from our apache iceberg side,  then we don't need to deploy any scala specific jars to the maven repository.\r\n\r\n> Should we revert https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4157 if we aren't publishing artifacts that are specific to a Scala version? Looks like the main benefit of multi-version is testing?\r\n\r\nI don't think we need to revert #4157  because we made the Scala version of Flink dependency dynamically configurable in the command line. This is very helpful for validating flink releases with different Scala versions, and indeed it also helps a lot for us to add scala versioned travis CI for flink integration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1048416054/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1048417294","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4193#issuecomment-1048417294","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4193","id":1048417294,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX84-fZQO","user":{"login":"openinx","id":5028729,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjg3Mjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5028729?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx","html_url":"https://github.com/openinx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-23T03:25:23Z","updated_at":"2022-02-23T03:25:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The failing unit test is still the flakey `testHashDistributionMode`, which will be resolved fundamentally in this PR https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4189\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.apache.iceberg.flink.TestFlinkTableSink > testHashDistributeMode[catalogName=testhive, baseNamespace=, format=PARQUET, isStreaming=true] FAILED\r\n    java.lang.AssertionError: There should be 1 data file in partition 'aaa' expected:<1> but was:<2>\r\n        at org.junit.Assert.fail(Assert.java:89)\r\n        at org.junit.Assert.failNotEquals(Assert.java:835)\r\n        at org.junit.Assert.assertEquals(Assert.java:647)\r\n        at org.apache.iceberg.flink.TestFlinkTableSink.testHashDistributeMode(TestFlinkTableSink.java:283)\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet's get this re-run again.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1048417294/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1048429340","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4189#issuecomment-1048429340","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4189","id":1048429340,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX84-fcMc","user":{"login":"stevenzwu","id":1545663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDU2NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1545663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu","html_url":"https://github.com/stevenzwu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-23T04:01:24Z","updated_at":"2022-02-23T04:12:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@openinx I have run the test hundreds of times locally in a test loop like you did before and was never able to reproduce it.\r\n\r\nThink again about the root cause that we discussed in the issue where we may miss the notifyCheckpointComplete callback.

If metadata is removed maybe the result data is still useful and can be reconstructed as a Hive table, but when object storage mode is enabled, it's basically not possible to track daown the file locations, making everything just orphan files.\r\n\r\nThat's generally true but there is a valid use case for keeping data files: you may use SNAPSHOT command in Spark that would create an Iceberg table pointing to non-Iceberg files. Those referenced data files may belong to other prod Hive tables. We allow to create Iceberg metadata to play with that data but we can't remove the imported data files. It may corrupt original tables.\r\n\r\n> I think the correct way to run remove orphan files is to do it for the entire warehouse.\r\n\r\nI hear your point and I think both use cases are valid. You are right, if a single prefix is shared by many tables and object store locations are enabled, the only way to remove orphans is by getting a list of all files under that prefix and querying systems tables for all Iceberg tables. However, I am not sure that's always possible. You have to assume no extra jobs use that location, you know all metastores/catalogs, etc. I'd say having a short per-table prefix or a set of prefixes would be also quite common. I can be convinced otherwise.\r\n\r\nI'd be interested to hear more from other folks too.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1048440808/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1048445263","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4154#issuecomment-1048445263","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4154","id":1048445263,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX84-fgFP","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-23T04:43:23Z","updated_at":"2022-02-23T04:43:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks, @rdblue!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1048445263/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1048450953","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4202#issuecomment-1048450953","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4202","id":1048450953,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX84-fheJ","user":{"login":"kbendick","id":9833362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MzMzNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9833362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick","html_url":"https://github.com/kbendick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-23T05:01:49Z","updated_at":"2022-02-23T06:19:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Updated some of the exceptions that are annotated with `@FormatMessage` to include a constructor with just `String message` to pass checkstyle.\r\n\r\nI figure this is ok, as we already allow for a format string with arguments (and no throwable).

While there still some drawbacks that need to consider:\r\n\r\n1. Different catalog has a different implementation for drop table. For example, `HadoopCatalog`/`HadoopTables` delete the whole warehouse directly and ignore the purge argument. In this case, we could not use `DeleteReachableFiles`.\r\n2. User self catalog may have some customized features, such as sending event/metrics when purging data. With `DeleteReachableFiles` we will ignore those operations.\r\n\r\n> I think it should match the removal of reachable files and be consistent in all APIs. Once we know locations owned by the table, we may drop them too.\r\n\r\nI think this is necessary. We should unify the built-in catalog behavior of the drop table [purge]. And maybe need to define the interface to support some parallel operations (by leveraging distributed engine, such as spark/flink/more).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1048551526/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1048562878","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4102#issuecomment-1048562878","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4102","id":1048562878,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX84-f8y-","user":{"login":"jackye1995","id":29823233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODIzMjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29823233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995","html_url":"https://github.com/jackye1995","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-23T08:54:26Z","updated_at":"2022-02-23T09:05:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rdblue I have been thinking about this during the night, I think it's better to move this class to the `org.apache.iceberg.aws.dynamodb` package instead of keeping it as is.\r\n\r\nWith the Glue optimistic locking change, I don't think any new user will use `org.apache.iceberg.aws.glue.DynamoLockManager`.

Were there concurrent writes? And what length of time did you use for `older_than`?\r\n\r\nThe interval you use is important if you have jobs that run for a long time. What usually is the case when this happens is that the `older_than` timestamp allows removing files that haven't been committed yet. For example, if you have `older_than` set to 3 hours ago and a job writes files for 4 hours, then the job may write files that get caught as orphan files because they're older than the limit and not (yet) committed to the table.\r\n\r\nAnother possibility is that your file system listing doesn't match the table listing, but that's more rare---we've only seen it with HDFS alternate name nodes so far.

However, such a target row might have already been updated (or deleted or locked) by another concurrent transaction by the time it is found. In this case, the repeatable read transaction will wait for the first updating transaction to commit or roll back (if it is still in progress). If the first updater rolls back, then its effects are negated and the repeatable read transaction can proceed with updating the originally found row. But if the first updater commits (and actually updated or deleted the row, not just locked it) then the repeatable read transaction will be rolled back with the message\r\n\r\n> ERROR:  could not serialize access due to concurrent update\r\n\r\n> because a repeatable read transaction cannot modify or lock rows changed by other transactions after the repeatable read transaction began.\r\n\r\nI think InsertOverwrite / ReplacePartitions is more like \"Delete *\" followed by \"Insert * \".  So I think we may follow the steps here they describe here for DELETE and throw exception if any row we are to delete has been modified by the time we commit.  So here, if we see either of 1. delete file or 2. deleted data files in the partition when we commit, we throw the exception as a potential validation constraint.\r\n\r\nIt also makes sense to me in a scenario say to use ReplacePartitions to do an update, ie \r\n```\r\n\"INSERT OVERWRITE employees PARTITIONS (date = '$date') SELECT name, salary + 1000, id FROM employees\"\r\n```\r\nonce I read a snapshot of the row for modification, I should not be updating it if it has been deleted by another concurrent transaction, as it would undo the delete.  \r\n\r\nI think new data files is fine, as it wont affect the set of rows we mark to be deleted once we start.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1049253233/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1049256271","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/59#issuecomment-1049256271","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/59","id":1049256271,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX84-imFP","user":{"login":"itaise","id":64745584,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NzQ1NTg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64745584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/itaise","html_url":"https://github.com/itaise","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itaise/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itaise/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itaise/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itaise/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itaise/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itaise/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itaise/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itaise/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itaise/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-23T22:01:00Z","updated_at":"2022-02-23T22:01:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks

I was a little confused on the issue but now I see the problem and have a workaround to try for folks dealing with this now.\r\n\r\nFrom what I can tell, the issues is primarily with V1 Iceberg tables where a column has a transform applied to it that changes its type, and then is dropped.\r\n\r\nFor example `bucket(10, stringColumn)` has a type \"int\" but when dropped in v1 is replaced with a `VoidTransform` which always returns null but has a type of \"string\". Reading the partition data with \"string\" when the actual data is \"Int\" causes problems.\r\n\r\nI think 3411 has the right fix and I just have a few minor comments on it.

People will need to add their own flink scala jars ( with scala 2.12 or scala 2.11).   So, I think our iceberg-flink artifact without scala version doesn't bring its scala transitive jar and cause user confusion.\r\n\r\n> Or we could remove the transitive dependency and remove the Scala version suffix from all the Jars.\r\n\r\nIt's definitely the correction approach for our next flink 1.15, but not possible for flink 1.14 currently.  As this https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4193#issuecomment-1048409144 said,  flink 1.15 will remove all the scala version for all the user required artifacts, but flink 1.14 only clean part of the artifacts to remove scala version. Although we iceberg-flink modue introduce the flink artifact with scala versions, but it not require the iceberg flink modules to attach the scala version because the iceberg-flink module does not use any scala code or depends on scala-related APIs, nor does it introduce transitive flink scala dependencies.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1049455989/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1049507535","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4216#issuecomment-1049507535","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4216","id":1049507535,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX84-jjbP","user":{"login":"rajarshisarkar","id":4561678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjE2Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4561678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajarshisarkar","html_url":"https://github.com/rajarshisarkar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajarshisarkar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajarshisarkar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajarshisarkar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajarshisarkar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajarshisarkar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajarshisarkar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajarshisarkar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajarshisarkar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajarshisarkar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-24T05:26:00Z","updated_at":"2022-02-24T05:26:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"cc:

Individual objects are stable once read, but the predicate itself may not be.```\r\n \r\nhttps://jepsen.io/consistency/models/snapshot-isolation\r\n```In a snapshot isolated system, each transaction appears to operate on an independent, consistent snapshot of the database. Its changes are visible only to that transaction until commit time, when all changes become visible atomically. If transaction T1 has modified an object x, and another transaction T2 committed a write to x after T1’s snapshot began, and before T1’s commit, then T1 must abort.```\r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure Postgres's definition there actually fits Snapshot Isolation better than Repeatable Read since [they don't allow Phantom Reads](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/transaction-iso.html#MVCC-ISOLEVEL-TABLE) which are allowed at a true Repeatable Reads Isolation . Snapshot Isolation in my mind says, you cannot modify records that were changed by a previous operation but you may modify records that were not modified by a previous commit while ignore the changes that previous commit produced.\r\n\r\nStolen from [Sql-Server Blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/sql-server-blog/serializable-vs-snapshot-isolation-level/ba-p/383281)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/413025/155622462-2a862637-a089-41fd-ac73-2032de7875fd.png)\r\n\r\nHere you imagine two commits as \r\n\"UPDATE color=white WHERE color = BLACK\" \r\n\"UPDATE color= black where color = WHITE\"\r\n\r\nBoth of these commits are allowed to occur as if they applied to the same original commit because each operation only effected an isolated set of marbles.\r\n\r\nSo in this case I believe INSERT OVERWRITE would never conflict with another INSERT, but would conflict with an update that changed any row within the partition being over-written. Another INSERT OVERWRITE would be a form of update so I believe @szehon-ho has the right of it here. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1050351570/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
