to adding support for this feature. On my side, the principal use-case where this is beneficial is when hashing a composite primary key where the cardinality of each individual primary key column is unknown. In this case, we rely on (1) a uniform random hash distribution of all composite primary key values and (2) configuring the number of hash buckets such that all records for each bucket fit on a single node during a distributed shuffle.\r\n\r\nThis allows us to optimize operations like distributed joins, deduplication, merge by primary key or any other composite unique key, etc. A bit more on the merge-by-primary-key use-case and subsequent optimizations as implemented in Ray can also be reviewed at https://github.com/ray-project/deltacat/blob/main/deltacat/compute/compactor/TheFlashCompactorDesign.pdf. We would like to be able to run our open source implementation of this design in Ray across Iceberg tables with equivalent efficiency, and I believe that the resolution of this issue would help here.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1854969584/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1855330976","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/9273#issuecomment-1855330976","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/9273","id":1855330976,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85ulhqg","user":{"login":"manuzhang","id":1191767,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTE3Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1191767?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang","html_url":"https://github.com/manuzhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-14T07:39:46Z","updated_at":"2023-12-14T07:39:46Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"The failed check is due to a flaky test.

I have a Flink job that is consuming from one kinesis data stream and writes into multiple different Iceberg Tables. Whenever we restart/update the application as you mention the checkpointID is stored. What we are seeing is that for some tables, randomly this checkpointID is increased, which cause that for some tables no commits occur. If Flink application was currently on checkpoint 890, all tables should have stored that checkpointid,  however for the tables that dont have any commits, what we see in the logs is that the checkpointid stored gets increased by almost a 100. So for the tables that correctly stored the checkpointid in state, commits happen as normal. For those that have the checkpoint increase, it wont commit until current checkpoint matches the one stored in state.
