That is related. I've been basing my model on the one in that example. In fact, I basically just copied it and changed the python conventions to R. \n\nHere's the issue I'm having: when I get to the \n\n```\ntotal_filters = num_filter * length(filter_list)\nconcat = mx.symbol.Concat(pooled_outputs, num.args=length(filter_list), dim=1)\nh_pool = mx.symbol.Reshape(data=concat, target_shape=c(batch_size, total_filters))\n```\n\nThe last line, using Reshape(), gives me an error, `from.shape() == to->shape() operands shape mismatch` I've tried changing the arguments to the Reshape() and nothing works.\n\nIf, instead, I use the `mx.symbol.Flatten(concat)` (as in the MNIST examples), the model will run, but the results are also way off. But that could just be my data or the untuned model parameters.\n\nI can't seem to find what \"Flatten\" is doing, or if it's accomplishing what the text classification example was trying to do with Reshape(). If not, how do I use Reshape() correctly? \n\nIf it's helpful, here's the model code. The input data is an array, 50 (sentence length) by 300 (word2vec embeddings) by 1 (channel) by 30000 (training samples).

for all the answers. I have yet another (hopefully final) question: Let's say we have an input of 100  samples. And let's assume that I have divided them main network into two layers: The first layer, containing first partial network, F1, is bound to exe1. After exe1 runs on the batch, its output is analyzed and we decide 60 of the output samples will be processed by network F2, represented by exe2 and the remanining 40 will be processed by another network F3, represented by exe3. \n\nWith pseudocode:\n`exe1.forward()`\n`#Determine which samples go into exe2 and exe3`\n`exe2Input = getExe2Input(exe1.outputs)`\n`exe3Input = getExe3Input(exe1.outputs)`\n`# copy exe2Input and exe3Input into input buffers for exe2 and exe3`\n`exe2.forward()`\n`exe3.forward()`\n`exe2.backward()`\n`exe3.backward()`\n`#Reshape and pad exe2.grad_dict[\"data\"] into grad2`\n`#Reshape and pad exe3.grad_dict[\"data\"] into grad3`\n`exe1.backward([grad2])`\n`exe1.backward([grad3])`\n\nIf 60 samples go into exe2 and 40 into exe3, the last two lines will execute 100 redundant operations in total since grad2 will have 40 and grad3 will have 60 zero entries as the result of padding.\n\nMy question is, how can we avoid these redundant backward calculations? A naive solution would be rebind two executors, exe1_2 and exe1_3 (encapsulating F1) according to 60 and 40 sample sizes, but in order to calculate gradients with them, we need to execute forward passes as `exe1_2.forward()` and `exe1_3.forward()`. So, for the first layer we execute two forward calculations (the other one is the first `exe1.forward()`). This again introduces redundancy. When we call the first forward() on exe1, actually we calculate all the needed intermediate results for the backward calculations for all 100 samples. To take it short: Is there any way to copy the results of the first `exe1.forward()` into both exe1_2 and exe1_3, such that we can directly call backward() on them, without redundantly executing forward passes?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/224625341/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/224648639","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/2363#issuecomment-224648639","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/2363","id":224648639,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNDY0ODYzOQ==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-08T16:33:26Z","updated_at":"2016-06-08T16:33:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"try
