The Outscale driver maps valid Outscale regions to the Outscale hosts. It should not let arbitrary hosts.\n\nIn this case, if you don't add any explicit valid region the Outscale driver works with the default region and it assigns the default host 'osu.eu-west-2.outscale.com'. The default region/host is the same for AWS2 and AWS4. It is the reason to see the same default host twice.\n\nYou can have a look in this line https://github.com/apache/libcloud/blob/trunk/libcloud/storage/drivers/rgw.py#L116\n\nMaybe it makes sense raising an expection when host is not none?

`SignedAliyunConnection` is derived by `ECSConnection` and `SLBConnection`. They have different api version, so we should not use a constant `ECS_API_VERSION` here.\nIn the derived connection classes, there is a `version` property, assigned the correct api version for different services respectively. We should use this as the version parameter for the signer.\nIt's better to add some defensive code to check `self.version is not None` before passing into the signer init method.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/224029816/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/224043477","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/799#issuecomment-224043477","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/799","id":224043477,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNDA0MzQ3Nw==","user":{"login":"Katana-Steel","id":3211867,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTE4Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3211867?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Katana-Steel","html_url":"https://github.com/Katana-Steel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Katana-Steel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Katana-Steel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Katana-Steel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Katana-Steel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Katana-Steel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Katana-Steel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Katana-Steel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Katana-Steel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Katana-Steel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-06T18:20:32Z","updated_at":"2016-06-09T06:50:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've only obfuscated the IP addresses a little, and only included the first 4 entries...\nI think that should be enough to see the pattern\n\n```\n~ $ ip neighbor \n1.2.10.80 dev br0 lladdr 52:54:00:bc:f9:6c STALE\n1.2.10.33 dev br0 lladdr 52:54:00:04:89:51 REACHABLE\n1.2.10.97 dev br0 lladdr 52:54:00:c6:40:ec DELAY\n1.2.10.40 dev br0 lladdr 52:54:00:77:1c:83 STALE\n\n~ # arp -an\n?

In the [security considerations](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ssl.html#ssl-security) statement, they recommend using a default context (_create_default_context_), but doing so would significantly change the behaviour of the ssl functionality today, by specifying defaults that the user didn't have before (so really, nothing has changed).\n\nIf the system is not supporting SSLContext (i.e, python 2.6), then we fall back to the previous method.\n\nWith regards to tests, can you tell me what additional coverage you need, bearing in mind the interface , which produces a wrap_socket, is practically identical? \n\nAlso, with regards to moving to requests, that's great news, but unfortunately, we need this functionality now, and can't really wait...
