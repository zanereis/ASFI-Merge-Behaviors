dashboard\r\n\r\nPitfalls:\r\nWith this flow depending on how the user has shares the dashboard it could be difficult to handle #4 in the `If you want to make changes to this published dashboard` section. If the user, is sending people urls with `slug_name` i.e. `superset.net/superset/dashboard/${slug_name}` we could build functionality into the dashboard view to switch out the names once some publishes the dashboard. \r\n\r\nWith `id`'s, `superset.net/superset/dashboard/${id}` there would need to be work on switching this reference in the metastore db.\r\n\r\nThanks @vylc for the reference","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/453873813/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/453879593","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/6440#issuecomment-453879593","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/6440","id":453879593,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1Mzg3OTU5Mw==","user":{"login":"zcattacz","id":1887956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4ODc5NTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1887956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcattacz","html_url":"https://github.com/zcattacz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcattacz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcattacz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcattacz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcattacz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcattacz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcattacz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcattacz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcattacz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcattacz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-14T00:24:22Z","updated_at":"2019-01-14T00:24:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"it can be worked around by specifying a  short name build directory `set TMPDIR=d:\\tmp`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/453879593/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/453887163","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/6600#issuecomment-453887163","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/6600","id":453887163,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1Mzg4NzE2Mw==","user":{"login":"zhouyao1994","id":5468589,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0Njg1ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5468589?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouyao1994","html_url":"https://github.com/zhouyao1994","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouyao1994/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouyao1994/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouyao1994/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouyao1994/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouyao1994/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouyao1994/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouyao1994/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouyao1994/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouyao1994/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-14T02:05:04Z","updated_at":"2019-01-14T02:05:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"i just update the document ,is this right?

That alternate key would be used for things like import/export across environments. \r\n\r\nAnother thought is having support for proper versioning for dashboards and charts. I'm thinking something much like `reversion` (the Django reusable app). This basically inserts new entries as you update, and allows you to roll back to previous versions. That may be overkill for now, but may be an option. It overloads the model quite a bit, think about the different version of each chart, and the dashboard version being a collection of charts at a point-in-time. It's a lot for users to handle and has to be designed well to be intuitive.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/453904999/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/453905119","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/6682#issuecomment-453905119","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/6682","id":453905119,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MzkwNTExOQ==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-14T05:30:06Z","updated_at":"2019-01-14T05:30:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Welcome
