and shot down already.</p>\n\n<p>But, instead of pooling watches, I believe that if there was one large global watcher that could essentially be re-used for everything, then that would significantly reduce the memory footprint required by the ZooKeeper object to store watches.  That is, its internal data structures would just be a bunch of references to the same actual object, so you just pay the cost of the extra references.  Given that it stores things as a Set<> on a path, it would only store it once for each path as well.

A new node gets placed in Zookeeper for a latch path. After that latches on that path are not able to get leadership. In my case \"Process A\" is releasing the leadership by closing the leader latch. I am using latch for a number of batch jobs. Zookeeper and Curator (Leader Latch) is being used to ensure that batch job on only one machine is executed (in a HA environment). This is happening for only of the jobs. This job is run every minute. In case of jobs that are running at less frequent intervals Leader latch is working fine.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604690467/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604690473","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/curator/issues/524#issuecomment-2604690473","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/524","id":2604690473,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MDQ2OTA0NzM=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-08-05T11:59:46Z","updated_at":"2025-01-21T13:08:26Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a
