@Lunderberg , it would still be useful to think about the overhead. While thread local is a different way of organizing things, the direct TLS lookup have a lower overhead than a lock based cache lookup. Assuming we only have the singleton case it might still be desirable to use TLS when possible(i understand that might restrict us to singleton usecases)\r\n\r\nAnother minor thing is we usually keep the non-public facing apis in src/ so they are not visible to the downstream deps.

I had been assuming that the main performance cost would be in the `std::unordered_map` lookup.  I'd expect that lookup to be roughly equivalent, since while the local map requires a lookup by `std::thread::id`, the TLS requires a lookup by `device_id`.  Having two threads block should be rare, since the locks are acquired non-exclusively whenever the thread's object already exists, but you are right that I didn't consider the cost of acquiring that shared lock in the first place.\r\n\r\nI'll see if I can measure the performance difference, and will also see whether I can refactor to maintain the ownership model of everything deriving from the `VulkanDeviceAPI`, while keeping the minimal overhead of TLS.\r\n\r\nRegarding the non-public apis, that makes sense.  It wasn't vulkan-specific, and so I didn't want it all the way in `src/runtime/vulkan`, but hadn't considered that impact of adding to the public api.  I will move `thread_map.h` (or whatever thread_local variant replaces it) to be in `src/runtime` instead.

I'd like to avoid replacing layers below TVM's operator libraries where possible.\r\n\r\nI can propose the following:\r\n\r\n- Do we agree on the following \"software stack\" ?:\r\n```\r\n                 inference_application[c,so]\r\n                                     |\r\n                      c_backend_api.[h,c]\r\n                      |                            |\r\n   c_runtime_api[h,c'                   |\r\n     TVM RUNTIME                   AOT\r\n                      |                            |\r\n                    platform-specific[h,c]\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Do we agree that, in the AOT path, we do not want to include/compile the c_runtime_api.[h,c] ?\r\n- Do we agree that the 'g_last_error' (TVMGetSetLastError()) is set by the running inference application and not by the lower runtime layers: c_runtime_api|platform_specific ?\r\n\r\nIn this case, I can move the 'g_last_error' (TVMGetSetLastError()) from the c_runtime_api[h,c] to the 'c_backend_api.[h,c]' and remove the duplicate 'g_last_error' functionality from the platform-specific implementation, 'runtime.c'.\r\nThe 'TVMAPIErrorf()' from the 'c_runtime_api.c' will have to be changed not to use the 'g_last_error', I have an impression that it is already pretty much the case. \r\n\r\n> Platform-specific defines in 'ai_platform.h': I need to verify and will get back on this point quickly.\r\n\r\nI am noticing that some of similar defines exist in 'c_runtime_api.h' and this is used pretty extensively throughout the TVM.\r\nHowever, if we agree that the 'c_runtime-api[h,c]' is not to be used within the AOT path, we cannot use it.\r\nI can propose to create some sort of 'c_runtime_defs.h' that would include platform-specific defines for:\r\n- AI_API_ENTRY  = TVM_DLL\r\n- AI_API_ALIGNED\r\n- AI_API_WEAK = TVM_WEAK\r\n- etc.\r\nThe platform-specific implementation can include this file then instead of the 'c_runtime_api.h'.\r\nStill the question of testing all different defines remain - but this is already the case with the 'c_runtime_api.h'.\r\n\r\n> i think there are still some open items on the C code (e.g. the .clang-format should get removed and reformatted; may need to see if files in src/runtime/contrib/stm32 should be somehow placed under src/runtime/crt, src/runtime/micro, or src/micro, since they aren't intended to be compiled with the C++ runtime), but not sure if you're waiting to address the ai_platform.h question there.\r\n\r\nMoving to a different code location is not an issue, please let us know which directory is most suitable.\r\nAnd I also see that there is no reason for us to not reformat the C code - OK.\r\n\r\n> I guess my concern with keeping the headers in place is that TVM code is supposed to be fairly uniform in style.\r\n\r\nI will remove the headers.\r\n\r\n> 'test_mnist_quant_fp': just wondering if the delete here was intentional?\r\n\r\nYes, intentional. We do not have a possibility to host these test-cases for downloading and they cannot be dowloaded from elsewhere.\r\n\r\nResuming: If we agree on re-organizing the 'c_runtime-api' as outlined above, I will align this PR and we will not need a separate PR in this case.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/855391490/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/855392525","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7719#issuecomment-855392525","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7719","id":855392525,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg1NTM5MjUyNQ==","user":{"login":"liaopeiyuan","id":34192321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTkyMzIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34192321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liaopeiyuan","html_url":"https://github.com/liaopeiyuan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liaopeiyuan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liaopeiyuan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liaopeiyuan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liaopeiyuan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liaopeiyuan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liaopeiyuan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liaopeiyuan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liaopeiyuan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liaopeiyuan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-06T12:36:14Z","updated_at":"2021-06-06T12:37:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Does the onnxruntime build on CI come with training mode enabled?

Do we also include the extra `mean` and `var` in outputs, or do we throw them away for them?

The c_backend_api is mainly a glue layer between the API exposed to operator functions and the platform-specific API, but it allows them to change independently of one another.\r\n\r\none note I'll make: right now \"deployed inference application\" as demonstrated/tested against Zephyr would use graph_executor and c_runtime_api. This is just due to the fact that we haven't finished developing the firmware-facing AOT interface yet.\r\n\r\n> Do we agree that, in the AOT path, we do not want to include/compile the c_runtime_api.[h,c] ?\r\n\r\nyeah definitely. i hope the above diagram clarifies my position on that, and apologies for any confusion. Stuff is changing fast right now.\r\n\r\n> Do we agree that the 'g_last_error' (TVMGetSetLastError()) is set by the running inference application and not by the lower runtime layers: c_runtime_api|platform_specific ?\r\n\r\ni think right now anything above c_backend_api could set that. c_runtime_api should be allowed to consume c_backend_api imo.\r\n\r\n> I can propose to create some sort of 'c_runtime_defs.h' that would include platform-specific defines for:\r\n>\r\n>AI_API_ENTRY = TVM_DLL\r\n>AI_API_ALIGNED\r\n>AI_API_WEAK = TVM_WEAK\r\n>etc.\r\n>The platform-specific implementation can include this file then instead of the 'c_runtime_api.h'.\r\n>Still the question of testing all different defines remain - but this is already the case with the 'c_runtime_api.h'.\r\n\r\ni think one question is whether we want to promote the `AI_API_` prefix to be the TVM standard prefix. if so, this makes sense to me. however, i think such a proposal would need to be explicitly in an RFC on the discuss. I think we'd like to ultimately wind up with something compatible either way, but perhaps it makes sense to confine this `c_runtime_defs.h` to the STM32 code for now and promote it once the API settles. One thing is that since AI_ prefix is sort of used by STM32 code, using it here would mean that we may need to be careful about stepping on you--whereas keeping with `tvm_` prefix should be more safe.\r\n\r\n> Moving to a different code location is not an issue, please let us know which directory is most suitable.\r\n> And I also see that there is no reason for us to not reformat the C code - OK.\r\n\r\nOK--here's what i think:\r\n1. if it stays in `src/runtime/contrib/stm32`, it needs to get formatted to the TVM guidelines\r\n2. if it lives outside of `src`, particularly in e.g. `apps/microtvm/stm32`, i don't think the formatting needs to follow TVM guidelines. \r\n\r\ni've been working on the project-generator more this past week and will post it this week. in that branch, i've moved all of the zephyr code into [`apps/microtvm/zephyr/demo_runtime`](https://github.com/areusch/incubator-tvm/tree/project-generator/apps/microtvm/zephyr/demo_runtime)--in particular, the \"emitter\" is in `microtvm_api_server.py`. i'd ideally like to keep all the platform-specific stuff underneath `apps/microtvm/<platform>`, which allows TVM to interface a single target (the Model Library Format + microtvm API server) but continue to target multiple platforms. in exchange, code in that directory doesn't need to necessarily follow all of TVM's C formatting standards (e.g. there is iOS code in some of those directories).\r\n\r\ni realize we had discussed this approach for stm32 before, but things weren't quite ready; plus you guys wanted to provide an improved API. we've discussed moving in the direction of improving microTVM's API such that the STM32 API can be provided by wrapping the microTVM API. when we reach that point, i'd like to move the STM32 code underneath `apps/microtvm/stm32` and use the project API (but, we may need to add to the API to allow generating libraries rather than whole projects, since the project generation for STM32 is handled by X-Cube tooling). \r\n\r\nif you want to locate your code in `apps/microtvm/stm32` now and avoid reformatting, even if it doesn't use project generator, that would also be fine with me--let me know if this makes sense or not to you guys.\r\n\r\n> Yes, intentional. We do not have a possibility to host these test-cases for downloading and they cannot be dowloaded from elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIf you want to push a PR to https://github.com/tlc-pack/web-data (see `testdata/microTVM`), we could host them there.\r\n\r\n> Resuming: If we agree on re-organizing the 'c_runtime-api' as outlined above, I will align this PR and we will not need a separate PR in this case.\r\n\r\nyeah that sounds fine to me. ideally it'd be a separate PR just to keep things neat, but it's not a big change so if it keeps things operationally simpler for you, feel free to include it here.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/856072634/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/856074433","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8156#issuecomment-856074433","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8156","id":856074433,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg1NjA3NDQzMw==","user":{"login":"areusch","id":532957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/532957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch","html_url":"https://github.com/areusch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-07T16:14:57Z","updated_at":"2021-06-07T16:14:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"thanks @mehrdadh , the PR is now merged!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/856074433/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/856085049","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8029#issuecomment-856085049","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8029","id":856085049,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg1NjA4NTA0OQ==","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-07T16:30:09Z","updated_at":"2021-06-07T16:30:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The documentation build now passes without warning when I run it locally, so let's see how it goes on the CI.

The stm32 AI_API_ has a few additional defines on top of the 'c_runtime_api' TVM_DLL and TVM_WEAK. I was proposing to add those as TVM_ defines as well  We can clean this up later. For now I will keep the stm32 defines with the ai_platform.h.\r\n\r\nWe prefer keep the source code with 'src/runtime/contrib/stm32' and I will reformat the code.\r\n\r\nI will align the PR and we'll discuss the next step.\r\n\r\nArthur\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/856190683/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/856192323","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7742#issuecomment-856192323","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7742","id":856192323,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg1NjE5MjMyMw==","user":{"login":"areusch","id":532957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/532957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch","html_url":"https://github.com/areusch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-07T19:17:09Z","updated_at":"2021-06-07T19:17:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@stoa sounds good to me!

It's about the fact that in order to call a function, you need to set a struct. The rewriter focuses on the structs (marking them conflicting) but the real allocations are lost (and get reused even when they don't need to be). If you have more questions, feel free to ask. \r\n* The point about testing is that it's very useful for us to test a quantized mobilenet, and coming up with the edge situation that that network is testing is non-trivial. So I saw having that network test as a two-bird-one-stone situation. \r\n* About the unified static memory planner, yes.

I'm not quite sure I understand the order of events that leads to the incorrect port, though. could you explain for my understanding?\r\n\r\nSure. Previously, when you set up a server on your device side, the device would open a new connection to the tracker. When the tracker accepts the connection, it will register the device and record where the connection comes from ([code](https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/64a8e81eeeefee0b11669dc83ee0d9ec871270f7/python/tvm/rpc/tracker.py#L311-L312)).
