Move the preempt serialization try catch logic in DAGScheduler into real serialization  util method. \nActually the first point came out to me when I write out this patch . But at last I didn't do it because actually they do different things, and the real serialization part is pulled out to Utils . So..  But I'll double check it again\nFor the second point , actually preempt serialization logic stayed in DAGScheduler for a long time (as far as I first met spark source code), so I don't know whether there is risk or other problems for scheduler. So I'll check the code again, and ,always , welcome any other review advice \nFor time limit, I didn't write test case for this new feature. And I welcome any test design advice .Thanks!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39079998/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39081093","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/273#issuecomment-39081093","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/273","id":39081093,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MDgxMDkz","user":{"login":"CodingCat","id":678008,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3ODAwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/678008?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat","html_url":"https://github.com/CodingCat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-03-31T12:11:45Z","updated_at":"2014-03-31T12:11:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@scwf Ah, I see, backend actor is started within TaskSchedulerImpl.start(), then adjusting order should be enough\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39081093/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39081816","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/273#issuecomment-39081816","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/273","id":39081816,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MDgxODE2","user":{"login":"scwf","id":7018048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMTgwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7018048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scwf","html_url":"https://github.com/scwf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scwf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scwf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scwf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scwf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scwf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scwf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scwf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scwf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scwf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-03-31T12:22:06Z","updated_at":"2014-03-31T12:22:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@CodingCat  right, it is an order issue.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39081816/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39081836","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/186#issuecomment-39081836","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/186","id":39081836,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MDgxODM2","user":{"login":"AmplabJenkins","id":4031291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzEyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4031291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/AmplabJenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-03-31T12:22:23Z","updated_at":"2014-03-31T12:22:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":" Merged build triggered.

My earlier take was that the Job level Info is useful in the UI as well. Currently, its not shown/used in the UI, but lots of our users get confused looking at the stage level UI showing their query multiple times. It will be good to expose the Job ID in the stage table as well. \n\nHaving said that, I do not see any other way of doing this. We will have to move this to the DAGScheduler as a cancelStage. If two jobs can share stages, then any handling from the UI side can have a race condition in the cancel work flow and it will be a lot cleaner to handle upstream. I will submit a revision shortly.\n\n@andrewor14, What do you think about adding a jobId column to the Stage table?\n\nThanks Mark for the

This gives a better separation. It also allows us to plug in more powerful tools for feature transformation in the future. I'm thinking about PMML at this time but there might be other options. User should decide whether to cache the data before transformation or after. Sometimes it is expensive to cache the one after because of densification or explosion of feature space. But IMHO this shouldn't be handled by learning algorithms. Ideally, feature transformation includes adding intercept.

It's something that is extremely confusing in graphx and we need to fix it. However, I am not sure if taking out the object reuse in edges is the way to fix this problem. \n\nThis is actually hard to test in micro benchmarks, because you rarely get GCs in micro benchmarks. In these cases where an edge/triplet is returned by an iterator, JVM's escape analysis cannot capture the scope and cannot do on-stack allocation. As a result, there are lots of temporary objects allocated in the heap.\n\nAllocations of short-lived objects are supposed to be cheap. The most expensive objects to gc are medium-lived objects. However, the more temporary objects we allocate, the more frequent a young gen gc happens. The more frequent young gen gc happens, the more likely for random objects to become medium lived. \n\nMaybe a better way to fix this is to leave the object reuse as is, but in all places where we return the object to the user, we should make sure it copies it.\n\nI just looked at the code, and I think we can accomplish that by just adding a copy to EdgeRDD.compute, i.e.\n\n``` scala\n  override def compute(part: Partition, context: TaskContext): Iterator[Edge[ED]] = {\n    firstParent[(PartitionID, EdgePartition[ED])].iterator(part, context).next._2.iterator.map(_.copy())\n  }\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39150913/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39150971","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/276#issuecomment-39150971","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/276","id":39150971,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MTUwOTcx","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-03-31T22:36:23Z","updated_at":"2014-03-31T22:36:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"And for EdgeTripletIterator we should just keep your change (i.e. always create a new row) since that is not used internally at all. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39150971/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39152681","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/204#issuecomment-39152681","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/204","id":39152681,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MTUyNjgx","user":{"login":"AmplabJenkins","id":4031291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzEyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4031291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/AmplabJenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-03-31T22:57:23Z","updated_at":"2014-03-31T22:57:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":" Build triggered.
