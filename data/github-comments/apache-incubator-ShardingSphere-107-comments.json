Thanks for your multiple feedback. \r\nAfter looking at your log info, I found there is no difference[1] between `logic SQL` and `actual SQL`,  which means sharding rule does not apply to this `logic

Open class `ExpressionAssert` and clear the comment of `SQLSegmentAssert.assertIs(assertContext, actual, expected)` in `assertSubqueryExpression`.\r\n2. run `SQLParserParameterizedTest`\r\n3. All the SQL cases which have the error assertion results are our targets to be fixed.\r\n\r\n### How to fix the above assertion results?\r\n1. Look at the exception log and find the corresponding `SQL Case ID` and `SQL`.\r\n2. Find out the `parsing result` of this `SQL Case ID` in `./incubator-shardingsphere/shardingsphere-sql-parser/shardingsphere-sql-parser-test/src/test/resources/sql/dml`\r\n3. Calculate the correct `start-index` and `stop-index` of `and-subquery-expression`, `between-subquery-expression` and `subquery-expression` segment of this `SQL`.\r\n4. Add the calculated `start-index` and `stop-index` labels of `and-subquery-expression`, `between-subquery-expression` and `subquery-expression` segment to `parsing result` of this `SQL Case ID`, like\r\n```\r\n            <subquery-expression  start-index=\"10\" stop-index=\"11\" />\r\n```\r\n5. Add the correct `literal-start-index` and `literal-stop-index` of `and-subquery-expression`, `between-subquery-expression` and `subquery-expression` segment to `parsing result` of this `SQL Case ID` when it is necessary, like\r\n```\r\n            <subquery-expression  literal-start-index=\"10\" literal-stop-index=\"11\" />\r\n```\r\n6. Run `SQLParserParameterizedTest` again to check whether this `SQL Case ID` does not stay in the list of `SQL` with  `bad assertion result`.\r\n\r\n### Note\r\n\r\n1. What are the definitions of `and-subquery-expression`, `between-subquery-expression`, and `subquery-expression`?\r\n`subquery-expression` means an expression that contains another query.\r\n\r\nFor instance, here is a SQL,\r\n> SELECT * FROM t_order WHERE user_id = (SELECT user_id FROM t_order_item WHERE id = 10)\r\n\r\nThe query of `SELECT user_id FROM t_order_item WHERE id = 10` is a `subquery-expression`.\r\n\r\n> SELECT * FROM t_order WHERE user_id between (select user_id from t_order_item where order_id = 10) and (select user_id from t_order_item where order_id = 12)\r\n\r\nThis example shows the value of `select user_id from t_order_item where order_id = 10` is a `between-subquery-expression`, on the other hand, `select user_id from t_order_item where order_id = 12` is `and-subquery-expression`.\r\n\r\n2. What is the difference between `literal-start-index` and `start-index`?\r\n\r\nWhen a SQL does not contain parameter maker, i.e.,`?`, this SQL only has one form; Otherwise, you will see two forms of this SQL, i.e, a SQL form filled with parameter and a SQL form only with parameter marks. For instance,\r\n```\r\nCase1 One SQL without parameter mark,\r\nselect * from table where id = 1;\r\n\r\nCase2 One SQL with parameter mark,\r\nOriginal SQL: select * from table where id = ?;\r\nSQL filled with Parameter: select * from table where id = 1;\r\n```\r\nReplace `the parameter mark` with `the actual parameter` will change the position of the segment. Therefore we need to add `start-index` to represent the start position of a segment for `Original SQL`, and `literal-start-index` is used to represent the start position of a segment for `SQL filled with Parameter`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/599885631/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/599885860","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/4783#issuecomment-599885860","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/4783","id":599885860,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5OTg4NTg2MA==","user":{"login":"tristaZero","id":27757146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NzU3MTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27757146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero","html_url":"https://github.com/tristaZero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-17T05:31:56Z","updated_at":"2020-03-17T05:31:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This issue is much easier than anyone of this series. :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/599885860/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/599886544","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/pull/4791#issuecomment-599886544","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/4791","id":599886544,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5OTg4NjU0NA==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-17T05:34:55Z","updated_at":"2020-03-17T08:03:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## Pull Request Test Coverage Report for [Build 10306](https://coveralls.io/builds/29411591)\n\n* **3** of **3**   **(100.0%)**  changed or added relevant lines in **1** file are covered.\n* **3** unchanged lines in **1** file lost coverage.\n* Overall coverage decreased (**-0.002%**) to **59.744%**\n\n---\n\n\n|  Files with Coverage Reduction | New Missed Lines | % |\n| :-----|--------------|--: |\n| [sharding-orchestration/sharding-orchestration-core/sharding-orchestration-core-registrycenter/src/main/java/org/apache/shardingsphere/orchestration/core/registrycenter/util/IpUtils.java](https://coveralls.io/builds/29411591/source?filename=sharding-orchestration%2Fsharding-orchestration-core%2Fsharding-orchestration-core-registrycenter%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Forg%2Fapache%2Fshardingsphere%2Forchestration%2Fcore%2Fregistrycenter%2Futil%2FIpUtils.java#L63) | 3 | 76.0% |\n<!-- | **Total:** | **3** |  | -->\n\n|  Totals | [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/builds/29411591/badge)](https://coveralls.io/builds/29411591) |\n| :-- | --: |\n| Change from base [Build 1089](https://coveralls.io/builds/29409529): |  -0.002% |\n| Covered Lines: | 12480 |\n| Relevant Lines: | 20889 |\n\n---\n##### 💛  -

Open class `IndexAssert` and clear the comment of `SQLSegmentAssert.assertIs(assertContext, actual, expected)` in `assertIs`.\r\n2. run `SQLParserParameterizedTest`\r\n3. All the SQL cases which have the error assertion results are our targets to be fixed.\r\n\r\n### How to fix the above assertion results?\r\n1. Look at the exception log and find the corresponding `SQL Case ID` and `SQL`.\r\n2. Find out the `parsing result` of this `SQL Case ID` in `./incubator-shardingsphere/shardingsphere-sql-parser/shardingsphere-sql-parser-test/src/test/resources/sql/dml`\r\n3. Calculate the correct `start-index` and `stop-index` of `index` segment of this `SQL`.\r\n4. Add the calculated `start-index` and `stop-index` labels of `index` segment to `parsing result` of this `SQL Case ID`, like\r\n```\r\n            <index name=\"t_log_index_t_log\" column=\"id\" unique=\"false\"  start-index=\"10\" stop-index=\"11\" />\r\n```\r\n5. Add the correct `literal-start-index` and `literal-stop-index` of `index` segment to `parsing result` of this `SQL Case ID` when it is necessary, like\r\n```\r\n            <index name=\"t_log_index_t_log\" column=\"id\" unique=\"false\"  literal-start-index=\"10\" literal-stop-index=\"11\" />\r\n```\r\n6. Run `SQLParserParameterizedTest` again to check whether this `SQL Case ID` does not stay in the list of `SQL` with  `bad assertion result`.\r\n\r\n### Note\r\n\r\n1. What is the definition of `index` segment?\r\n\r\nFor instance, here is a SQL,\r\n> CREATE TABLE t_order (order_id NUMBER(10) PRIMARY KEY USING INDEX order_index, user_id NUMBER(10), status VARCHAR2(10), column1 VARCHAR2(10), column2 VARCHAR2(10), column3 VARCHAR2(10))\r\n\r\nThe segment of `INDEX order_index` is a `index-segment`.\r\n\r\n2. What is the difference between `literal-start-index` and `start-index`?\r\n\r\nWhen a SQL does not contain parameter maker, i.e.,`?`, this SQL only has one form; Otherwise, you will see two forms of this SQL, i.e, a SQL form filled with parameter and a SQL form only with parameter marks. For instance,\r\n```\r\nCase1 One SQL without parameter mark,\r\nselect * from table where id = 1;\r\n\r\nCase2 One SQL with parameter mark,\r\nOriginal SQL: select * from table where id = ?;\r\nSQL filled with Parameter: select * from table where id = 1;\r\n```\r\nReplace `the parameter mark` with `the actual parameter` will change the position of the segment. Therefore we need to add `start-index` to represent the start position of a segment for `Original SQL`, and `literal-start-index` is used to represent the start position of a segment for `SQL filled with Parameter`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/600000359/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/600007751","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/4805#issuecomment-600007751","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/4805","id":600007751,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwMDAwNzc1MQ==","user":{"login":"kimmking","id":807508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzUwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/807508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking","html_url":"https://github.com/kimmking","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-17T10:59:24Z","updated_at":"2020-03-17T11:00:07Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"On
