For the time being, if  you bump into this issue I request you to truncate the meton_update table manually.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/346034252/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/346035308","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/803#issuecomment-346035308","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/803","id":346035308,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NjAzNTMwOA==","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-21T14:02:48Z","updated_at":"2017-11-21T14:11:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @iraghumitra - The UI does not refresh itself after a metaalert is deleted.  If this is something easy to fix, let's tackle it.  Otherwise, I can create a JIRA to track this and we can fix it as a separate PR.\r\n\r\nEDIT: More specifically, after I delete a metaalert, I can still see in the Filters panel; under source:type, a count of metaalerts equal to 1.  If that panel refreshed, it should show 0 metaalerts in this case.  Once the UI is refreshed, either manually or through the background refresh, the Filters panel state is corrected.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Same thing happens if I delete a child alert from a metaalert.  In the main panel, I do not immediately see the child alert that was removed from the metaalert.  After a manual or background refresh, I then see the results I would expect.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/346035308/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/346045479","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/803#issuecomment-346045479","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/803","id":346045479,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NjA0NTQ3OQ==","user":{"login":"iraghumitra","id":15019012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDE5MDEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15019012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iraghumitra","html_url":"https://github.com/iraghumitra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iraghumitra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iraghumitra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iraghumitra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iraghumitra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iraghumitra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iraghumitra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iraghumitra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iraghumitra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iraghumitra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-21T14:36:51Z","updated_at":"2017-11-21T14:36:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@nickwallen I am not refreshing on purpose.

I think this is a pretty critical function and needs a test.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/346146568/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/346236489","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/814#issuecomment-346236489","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/814","id":346236489,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NjIzNjQ4OQ==","user":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-22T03:57:46Z","updated_at":"2017-11-22T03:57:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Great catch!

If this is right maybe this is the best time we can move towards changing field seperators accordingly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/347112481/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/347131196","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/840#issuecomment-347131196","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/840","id":347131196,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NzEzMTE5Ng==","user":{"login":"alinazemian","id":8438293,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MzgyOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8438293?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alinazemian","html_url":"https://github.com/alinazemian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alinazemian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alinazemian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alinazemian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alinazemian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alinazemian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alinazemian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alinazemian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alinazemian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alinazemian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-27T09:52:06Z","updated_at":"2017-11-27T09:52:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"One of the issues that we had with the previous mpack was the lack of config segregation for Elasticsearch Master Nodes and Data Nodes. Hence, we have ended up hardcoding specific configuration outside Ambari. With ES 5 it will be even more complex due to the existence of Ingestion Nodes and ML Nodes. Therefore, it would be really nice if we can have multiple tabs in Ambari ES service. For example, one tab for generic configurations and another tab per each node type to segregate specific configurations from generic ones.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/347131196/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/347186119","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/803#issuecomment-347186119","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/803","id":347186119,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NzE4NjExOQ==","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-27T13:48:05Z","updated_at":"2017-11-27T13:48:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@iraghumitra Can you describe how you install Node/NPM on your development box?

All the core functionality is there.  We also have sufficient test coverage for the functionality that was added.\r\n\r\nI have been able to get the e2e tests to run good enough (IMO) to move forward with the PR.  Based on the experimentation that I describe below, I believe that the test failures are due to the tests and test infrastructure and not the core functionality in the PR.  \r\n\r\nThe intermittent failures are a pre-existing condition to this PR.  This makes me comfortable enough to merge this PR and then follow-on with test fixes.  @iraghumitra mentioned that he is currently working on improving the tests and will open a separate PR.  \r\n\r\n1. I used Brew to install the following versions of Node/NPM.\r\n    ```\r\n    $ node --version\r\n    v8.9.1\r\n\r\n    $ npm --version\r\n    5.5.1\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n2. Before running the tests, truncate the `metron_update` table.  The tests cannot currently clear out old test data stored in HBase.\r\n\r\n3. Enabling/disabling sets of tests in `metron-interface/metron-alerts/protractor.conf.js` also allowed me to see that all the tests can pass on an intermittent basis.  It seems that earlier test failures may cause later tests to fail unnecessarily.\r\n\r\n4. Run the e2e tests using the following steps.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    cd metron-interface/metron-alerts\r\n    npm install\r\n    ./node_modules/.bin/webdriver-manager update\r\n    ./node_modules/.bin/protractor\r\n    ```\r\n\r\nThanks for working through this with me @iraghumitra.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/347261545/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/347280458","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/840#issuecomment-347280458","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/840","id":347280458,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NzI4MDQ1OA==","user":{"login":"mmiklavc","id":658443,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODQ0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/658443?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc","html_url":"https://github.com/mmiklavc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-27T18:36:12Z","updated_at":"2017-11-27T18:36:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mraliagha I do think we should consider revisiting the field name conventions, but I'd push for that as a follow-on task.
