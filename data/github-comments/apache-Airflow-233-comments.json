web ui use **ldap3**\r\nSo I failed to start airflow if I don't downgrade to python-ldap.\r\nI think there should have a change, downgrade ldap or upgrade ldap in FAB

correct, the `_find_zombies()` function returns zombies for all the DAGs (or an empty list within the 10 second window). But the caller of this function https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/93de2ce7c337e6aad240a7a043a6bd3fc86f2bc2/airflow/utils/dag_processing.py#L1217 then only starts processors for `n` DAG files which receive the list of zombies, subsequent processors for other DAG files just get an empty list.\r\n\r\nThe list of (all or none) zombies is passed down via `DagFileProcessor` and `SchedulerJob.process_file()` to `DagBag.kill_zombies()` https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/93de2ce7c337e6aad240a7a043a6bd3fc86f2bc2/airflow/models/dagbag.py#L271 which then checks each zombie if it belongs to the DAG and kills it.\r\n\r\nThis is far too complex for such a simple thing like detecting zombie task instances and kill them. Last Friday I debugged 5 hours to find the reason.\r\n\r\nI thought about if it's not better to remove the zombie detection from `DagFileProcessorManager` and all the passing the list around and just implement the query within `DagBag.kill_zombies()`, which can only search for it's own DAGs and there a 10 seconds delay makes sense.

I know most DAGs run on a schedule, but raising an exception if not setting `start_date`/`schedule_interval` IMO cancels out the use case for a manual only triggered DAG in Airflow (where IMO it doesn't make sense to provide a `start_date` and `schedule_interval`).\r\n\r\nI'd say:\r\n\r\n1. if both not set: scheduler doesn't know when to run -> manual trigger only _(currently not possible)_\r\n2. if only start_date set: default schedule_interval is `timedelta(days=1)` in 1.10.*, in master None. If schedule_interval=None, scheduler won't schedule any tasks because no intervals can be computed.\r\n3. if only schedule_interval set: currently raises an error \"Task is missing the start_date parameter\". Not sure if it makes sense to allow this. Maybe something to think about and start scheduling from the day it was added(?)\r\n4. if both schedule_interval and start_date set -> run at given interval starting from the start_date\r\n\r\nI've seen cases before where people tried to do (1) and had to set a start_date for no obvious reason, so that's why I suggest to not make it required. The scheduler should not pick up any tasks unless somebody triggers the DAG by hand. If we were to allow cases (1) and (4) only:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nif (self.start_date and not self.schedule_interval) or (not self.start_date and self.schedule_interval):\r\n    raise ...\r\n\r\n# same thing, bit shorter:\r\nif bool(self.start_date) ^ bool(self.schedule_interval):\r\n    raise ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nBit swamped in work - will add a test when I find

An interesting fact is that In boto2 function `delete_keys()` works well on empty array provided.\r\n\r\nAccording to your second question - in unix shell the result depends on the \"force\" flag, see:\r\n```\r\n~ $ mkdir /tmp/e\r\n~ $ rm /tmp/e/file # deleting non-existing keys\r\nrm: /tmp/e/file: No such file or directory\r\n~ $ echo $?\r\n1\r\n~ $ rm -f /tmp/e/file\r\n~ $ echo $?\r\n0\r\n~ $ rm # deleting empty keys\r\nusage: rm [-f | -i] [-dPRrvW] file ...\r\n       unlink file\r\n~ $ echo $?\r\n64\r\n~ $ rm -f # deleting empty keys\r\n~ $ echo $?\r\n0\r\n```\r\nI just checked that the operator already works as in the \"force\" mode because deleting non-existing key results in task success. So currently it works in mixed-force mode: for deleting nonexisting key it works exactly as `rm -f`, for deleting no keys it works as `rm`. This PR applies \"force\" mode for both cases.\r\n\r\n@ashb thank you for your suggestion, it makes 100% sense to add a flag here. Should it be named `not_found_mode` as in IMAP or maybe `force` to match syntax for unix tools that in general \"remove things\"?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/503445558/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/503466608","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5430#issuecomment-503466608","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5430","id":503466608,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMzQ2NjYwOA==","user":{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-19T08:42:22Z","updated_at":"2019-06-19T08:44:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"If
