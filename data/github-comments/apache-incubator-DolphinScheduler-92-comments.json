Running command `bin/hadoop jar wordcount.jar org.apache.hadoop.examples.WordCount [GENERIC_OPTIONS] [COMMAND_OPTIONS]` will execute `\"$JAVA\" $JAVA_HEAP_MAX $HADOOP_OPTS $CLASS \"$@\"` with `CLASS=org.apache.hadoop.util.RunJar` ([source code](https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/branch-2.8.5/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/main/bin/hadoop#L166))\r\n2. The class `org.apache.hadoop.util.RunJar` parses the args with usage `\"RunJar jarFile [mainClass] args...\"`, but not parse the generic options ([source code](https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/branch-2.8.5/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/util/RunJar.java#L156))\r\n3. The example `WordCount` will handle generic Hadoop command-line options ([source code](https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/branch-2.8.5/hadoop-mapreduce-project/hadoop-mapreduce-examples/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/examples/WordCount.java#L68))\r\n4.

In other words, this issue depends on your implementation.\r\n\r\n**Conclusion**: This issue is not a

Hi @dailidong, @CalvinKirs, the 10 code smell being reported by sonar are actually not code smells.
