Please address the licensing concern and I'll take another look.

Can you show me an example of what Page 1 (TOP) and Page 2 (OFFSET) queries would look like such that they will work together?\r\n\r\nIf you meant that there will be no paging and only TOP will be used, then the code already supports this without an ORDER BY:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (limit != null && offset == null){\r\n             query.append(\"TOP \");\r\n             query.append(limit);\r\n             query.append(\" \");\r\n         }\r\n```\r\nThe ORDER BY check only kicks in if `offset` also does not equal `null`.

@pvillard31 I made the changes and squashed the commits since about 50% of my changes were basically rolled back to the original code.\r\n\r\nOne issue... it doesn't work, NiFI can't find and load the

The first few I have are below:\r\n\r\nFirst in regards to the internal queue of messages, there needs to be some kind of limit on it. If a user doesn't set a fast enough trigger duration the queue could become enormous and, since all the messages are held in memory, potentially bringing NiFi to a halt. Here is the property I add to ConsumeMQTT[2].\r\n\r\nThis leads to the second, what to do with the internal queue when the processor is stopped. There will potentially be some data left in the internal queue when the processor is stopped and if that data is not handled it will more than likely be lost. In the OnStopped I actually transfer all messages in the queue (just like is done int he OnTrigger)[3].\r\n\r\nIn the PutAWSIoT processor, you read the attributes from the FlowFile to essentially overwrite Processor defined properties. Being able to have different QoS/Topics/Retained different messages is very important and the most user friendly way to do this is through Expression Language. Check out how I do it here[4]. This gives the user to potentially dynamically select the QoS/Topic/Retained and doesn't do things automatically for the user.\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/apache/nifi/tree/f47af1ce8336c9305916f00738976f3505b01b0b/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-mqtt-bundle/nifi-mqtt-processors/src/main/java/org/apache/nifi/processors/mqtt\r\n[2] https://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/f47af1ce8336c9305916f00738976f3505b01b0b/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-mqtt-bundle/nifi-mqtt-processors/src/main/java/org/apache/nifi/processors/mqtt/ConsumeMQTT.java#L111\r\n[3] https://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/f47af1ce8336c9305916f00738976f3505b01b0b/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-mqtt-bundle/nifi-mqtt-processors/src/main/java/org/apache/nifi/processors/mqtt/ConsumeMQTT.java#L233\r\n[4] https://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/f47af1ce8336c9305916f00738976f3505b01b0b/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-mqtt-bundle/nifi-mqtt-processors/src/main/java/org/apache/nifi/processors/mqtt/PublishMQTT.java#L63","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/280915127/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/280915161","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1521#issuecomment-280915161","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1521","id":280915161,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MDkxNTE2MQ==","user":{"login":"trixpan","id":3108527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMDg1Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3108527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan","html_url":"https://github.com/trixpan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-19T12:13:07Z","updated_at":"2017-02-19T12:13:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"**JPercivall**\r\nA bit nit picky and I may be alone here, but I find putting \"if\" statements and their content on the same line a bit hard to read when trying to read someone else's code.
