doing larger PRs is fine. Just not crazy large. Someone has to review the PR somehow.\r\n\r\nSo it depends how complex a PR is. If it does something simple in 200 files.. it might be ok. You can also put multiple commits into a single PR which makes reviewing also easier. \r\n\r\nThis one for example is too big #5203 since merging this will cause too many conflicts at once to other PRs. This is better #5189.\r\nAlso keep in mind that PRs uses apache resources since CI has to build and test a lot - too many PRs is also bad if they can be combined into medium-sized PRs.\r\n\r\nSo please don't open too many PRs since we have to merge some first. You can work with your clone of netbeans without creating PRs, and once we can merge more you simply open more if you want.

Things like this can be a big time sink for reviewers since the first concern are regressions caused by the refactoring of old tests. The benefit of having nicer looking tests is minimal.\r\n \r\nThe project has also no lack of tests, its more a lack of resources to run them all at once and also a test reliability problem of often failing tests in some areas.\r\n \r\nThere are commented out tests here which probably need fixes otherwise they wouldn't be commented out in the first place:\r\n https://github.com/apache/netbeans/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml\r\n \r\nThere are a whole bunch of tests which can't run on JDK 11 which need fixes (but this one is hard since the easy ones are probably already fixed):\r\n https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/4904\r\n\r\nSo there is a lot of test related work available.
