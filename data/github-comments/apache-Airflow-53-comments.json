A couple of things:.\n\n_Paused DAG checking now occurs at the task instance level in models.py instead of in jobs.py to consolidate the \"should this task run\" logic into one place_\n\nI think this should happen at the DagRun level not at the task instance level. (Dag->DagRun Task->TaskInstance)\n\n_To make things less confusing for users, force running a task will now override/ignore:\ntask instance's pool being full_\n\nThis is an operational issue. At a minimum I would like to see a \"Pool is full. Please confirm\"\n\n_task instance is already queued_\n\nWhat will happen with the queued instance?\n\n_Failed tasks will no longer be considered \"runnable\", they must be force-run or cleared first from the UI to be run, just like successful tasks_\n\nNice!\n\n_Future work_\n\n_Parallelize task instance dependency checking._\n\nI have some ideas about this. I think we can go below 1-2s loops on a single core and reducing the amount of queries significantly by having taskinstances update counters in the dagrun. The issue lies in the are_dependencies_met function that does aggregate queries for every task(!).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/221654875/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/221662989","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1518#issuecomment-221662989","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1518","id":221662989,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMTY2Mjk4OQ==","user":{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-25T18:23:40Z","updated_at":"2016-05-25T18:23:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"In addition please follow the commit guidelines (proper commit message plz etc).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/221662989/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/221663404","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1513#issuecomment-221663404","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1513","id":221663404,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMTY2MzQwNA==","user":{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-25T18:25:03Z","updated_at":"2016-05-25T18:25:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sorry I am not convinced.

\nIt looks like the CLI automatically includes subdag clearing as part of the clear operation. It could be useful to add a toggle to the CLI as well, just to keep the UI and CLI in sync. I don't use subdags, so I cannot weigh in on whether it would be useful to ever run a clear that did not in-fact clear subdags. The behavior prior to your change always cleared subdags by default - your UI change made it possible to not clear subdags.
