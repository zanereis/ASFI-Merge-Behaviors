you and welcome here!\r\nIt seems Flatlaf is pretty swift on releases. I'm also tinkering on a gruvbox theme based on Flatlaf.\r\nSo I've thought it would be better to move the actual flatlaf jar into a separate library embedder module.\r\nI'm just finished PR, and it also contains the 0.20 upgrade.\r\nI hope you don't mind if I'd close this PR in favor of that one.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/559861135/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/559865074","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1686#issuecomment-559865074","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/1686","id":559865074,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1OTg2NTA3NA==","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-29T19:00:58Z","updated_at":"2019-11-29T19:00:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Agreed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/559865074/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/559866026","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1698#issuecomment-559866026","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/1698","id":559866026,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1OTg2NjAyNg==","user":{"login":"DevCharly","id":5604048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MDQwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5604048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DevCharly","html_url":"https://github.com/DevCharly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DevCharly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DevCharly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DevCharly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DevCharly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DevCharly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DevCharly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DevCharly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DevCharly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DevCharly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-29T19:07:53Z","updated_at":"2019-11-29T19:07:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> It seems Flatlaf is pretty swift on releases.\r\n\r\nYes, currently pushing FlatLaf forward to reach 1.0 in the next months...\r\n\r\n> I hope you don't mind if I'd close this PR in favor of that one.\r\n\r\nNo problem 👍 \r\n\r\nBTW many thanks for adding FlatLaf to NetBeans.
