I think it it best if we adopt a policy that these are kept in sync (to the best of our ability) from now on. This has been an issue previously with dependencies like httpclient, etc. however from now on dependency management should be better handled. I think what you are doing is the right way to go.\n\n> or is it OK that it's attached to NUTCH-2234? I'm thinking, for example, when someone addsthis fix to CHANGES.txt, the ticket description doesn't match the actual fix (i.e. this upgrades Elasticsearch to 2.3.3, not 2.1.1, etc.).\n\nwe don't need to add anything to changes.txt apart from the Jira release report. The release announcement is a different kettle of fish and should be more user friendly. \n\nOne thing on the side here. Every pull request and commit message should reflect the Jira tickey title. This way all of our Github hooks work flawlessly.

Now I understand why I had to jump through hoops to upgrade the Elasticsearch dependency for both #118 and NUTCH-2287.\n\n@naegelejd, the implementation works and was an initial attempt to sync lucene-core (and transitive deps) across the Nutch plugin and core codebase. Lets work on getting #118 in there for the time being. The dependency management issue is nothing new. It is however something which can be improved. \n\n> Lucene dependencies should not be in ivy/ivy.xml \n\nI agree\n\n> and I really don't think the scoring-similarity plugin should be relying on the dependencies of the indexer-elastic plugin.\n\nWell, this is one way we can sync dependencies. That is the goal however I agree that the direct dependency is not optimal.\n\n> I'd be happy to fix this if someone takes it seriously and merges it soon.\n\nLets revisit your patch for #118 first. We can then come back to this.

Lewis,\n\nHere was that plugin I worked on a few months ago; unfortunately, I was running into methodNotFound errors using the Jest dependency. It turned out to be a versioning conflict between several apache http libraries (httpclient, httpcore, httpcore-nio). I tried adding them to the plugin's ivy.xml file without any success. However, after I added them to the root ivy.xml file, I'm no longer seeing these errors. \n\nIs there a better way around this issue besides modifying the root ivy.xml file? And if I resolve it, is there any chance this PR would get merged?\n\nThanks!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/comments/237471117/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/comments/238197471","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nutch/pull/119#issuecomment-238197471","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/119","id":238197471,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzODE5NzQ3MQ==","user":{"login":"sebastian-nagel","id":1630582,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzA1ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1630582?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastian-nagel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-08T10:21:47Z","updated_at":"2016-08-08T10:21:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Real-world testing continued over two [Common Crawl](http://commoncrawl.org/) monthly crawls.\nThere is still one problem: if data is moved from one file system to another this fails with the current patch.

I've added the Apache License as comments to the howto_upgrade_es.txt\n2. I've installed an Eclipse Formatting Plugin into Intellij, and have run it on the plugin; everything is now 2 spaces indented\n3. I've refactored all 'e.printstacktrace()' calls to be Logger.error() calls instead (sorry for the inconsistency, my IDE autogenerates these for try catch blocks, and I forgot to replace some of them with Logger.error() calls)\n4. I've changed all Logger method calls to use parameterized logging\n5. I've also changed the RuntimeException to be an IllegalStateException instead, since the host and port information must be provided (and it would be an illegal state to proceed without them)\n6. I've also fixed the package.info to mention the RESTful nature of the plugin\n7. I'm still sort of confused on what the setConf method was supposed to do, but I've refactored it to mimic the other elastic index writer plugin; I'm not sure how the Conf object passed in this method differs from the JobConf object passed in the \"open\" method, so I have the open method handling the class member initialization (since that's what the other plugins seem to do). \n\nThe plugin also does support authentication! If you've enabled the https option in nutch-site.xml, and the username and password fields are both not empty, the plugin will attempt to use them to perform a basic-auth request. I've also deleted one of the todo's since I've included the code to perform NoOp verification on hostnames (if the option is set to true in nutch-site) as well as trusting self-signed certs. I've also created the JIRA issue as requested: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NUTCH-2304 and I've set the External Issue URL to point to this pull request's associated issue. \n\nThanks for reviewing my pull request!\nPlease let me know if there are any other changes I should fix; I'll be happy to commit them the next weekend I'm free.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/comments/241232884/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/comments/241533410","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nutch/pull/143#issuecomment-241533410","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/143","id":241533410,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MTUzMzQxMA==","user":{"login":"sebastian-nagel","id":1630582,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzA1ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1630582?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastian-nagel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-22T20:07:36Z","updated_at":"2016-08-22T20:07:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 Lgtm!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/comments/241533410/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/comments/241885800","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nutch/pull/146#issuecomment-241885800","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/146","id":241885800,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MTg4NTgwMA==","user":{"login":"lewismc","id":1165719,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjU3MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1165719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc","html_url":"https://github.com/lewismc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-23T21:30:03Z","updated_at":"2016-08-23T21:30:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@kamaci I've tested and committed this.

There may be still conflicts between \"base\" libs and plugin dependencies, see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NUTCH-2316 for such an issue.\n\nTo add only libs from activated plugins to the class path would only make conflicts less probable. But we allow users to use any combination of available plugins, so sooner or later we see a conflict as a Jira issue. Also making the build use a runtime configuration such as the property `plugin.includes` would violate the idea that users always can deploy their configuration by just placing the customized nutch-site.xml in a folder which comes early on the classpath. \n\n> In consequence, we would have to make sure that there are absolutely no conflicts between all dependencies. Is this a bad thing? Imho it is a good thing. It is possibly a naive position to assume that we can obtain zero conflicts.\n\nYes, of course, it would be the best solution if we could resolve all conflicts. No question. But there are many conflicts, e.g., currently we have in runtime/local:\n\n```\nlib/httpclient-4.3.5.jar\nplugins/lib-htmlunit/httpclient-4.3.4.jar\nplugins/lib-selenium/httpclient-4.5.1.jar\nplugins/indexer-solr/httpclient-4.4.1.jar\nplugins/indexer-cloudsearch/httpclient-4.3.6.jar\n```\n\nAnd the right way would be: 1. resolve the conflicts and make sure that everything runs fine, 2. configure one global classpath. To get NUTCH-2316 resolved could be the first step of the first task.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/comments/250010933/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
