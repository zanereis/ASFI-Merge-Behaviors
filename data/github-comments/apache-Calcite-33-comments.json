I have added new benchmark test case for baseline to disable guava caching.

Guava cache overhead is a little too big, compared to JDK ConcurrentHashMap. But JDK ConcurrentHashMap is not limit sized, so in the previous discussion, we do not choose JDK ConcurrentHashMap.\r\n2. Guava cache overhead is even bigger than looking up method for each call. This is what surprised me.\r\n3. The original implementation is the slowest one because it has to get from map, look up method then put method to map, it combines all the operations, the solution works well in the same instance, but for every Calcite invocation it has to sacrifice performance to look up method every time, that is where the PR tries to improve. \r\n\r\nThe current version does improve performance and balance memory usage. But it is slower than 1) JDK ConcurrentHashMap for caching (but not limit size), 2) looking up method direct in each call without map operations. \r\n\r\nPS. Correct me if I am wrong, there is no `softKeys` api in guava, actually I find places in Calcite to hold classes as key in HashMap as global caching, like `org.apache.calcite.sql2rel.ReflectiveConvertletTable`, and I just notice that a new PR #1901 also uses global hashset and COW list in `JaninoRelMetadataProvider.java`, so I was wondering if global caching with JDK ConcurrentHashMap could work here as well. Looking forward to your advice.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/611042597/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/611148690","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/1900#issuecomment-611148690","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/1900","id":611148690,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMTE0ODY5MA==","user":{"login":"vineetgarg02","id":22458392,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDU4Mzky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22458392?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vineetgarg02","html_url":"https://github.com/vineetgarg02","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vineetgarg02/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vineetgarg02/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vineetgarg02/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vineetgarg02/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vineetgarg02/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vineetgarg02/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vineetgarg02/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vineetgarg02/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vineetgarg02/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-08T19:30:20Z","updated_at":"2020-04-08T19:30:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":">

If we have missed one type of relnode, then when we need to estimate its average column size, we need to regenerate the `sizeHandler`, which takes 10+ms; then we estimates the row count, and we need to regenerate the `rowCountHandler`, which takes another 10+ms; and then we need to estimate the selectivity, another 10+ms, and so on. \r\n\r\nPlease note that, the total optimization time (for Volcano planner) is only about several hundred ms. So the performance penalty can be very expensive. \r\n\r\nWithout this flag, performance diagnostic can be very difficult. And this issue can only be solved in Calcite (due to lazy initialization, the handler is first generated in the `revise` method, so it cannot be solved in client code)\r\n\r\nFinally, please note that the change does not introduce eagerly initialization.

The master branch version may call Reflection the first time, and then will use JDK HashMap as cache in instance level which does not bad. \r\n\r\nSo my opinion is, if we can not use JDK ConcurrentHashMap as global cache, then the update may no longer necessary. Hopefully the unit test and benchmark could be useful after all.

, when you have some time, please take another look at the PR, I have done some rework and refactoring.\r\nI am trying to provide a patch with two main goals:\r\n- 100% backwards compatibility: by default, everything will be working as before, downstream projects should have no impact because of this change (by default all String comparisons will still be executed via `String#compareTo`, as usual).\r\n- Provide an alternative to specify a different comparison behavior, based on a Java Collator (see `JavaCollation` class).\r\n\r\nThe current design fulfills these two requirements, but I must admit I'm not 100% sure if this is the right direction in the long term. So I would accept to annotate `SqlCollation#getCollator` method and the whole `JavaCollation` class as \"Experimental\" (i.e. subject to change without notice).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/621753623/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/621931345","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/1940#issuecomment-621931345","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/1940","id":621931345,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMTkzMTM0NQ==","user":{"login":"jinxing64","id":4058918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNTg5MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4058918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64","html_url":"https://github.com/jinxing64","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-30T15:36:18Z","updated_at":"2020-04-30T15:36:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sure
