I think I've addressed the most recent round of comments.  Thanks again for all the detailed feedback!\n\nA few notes:\n- The out of date URL was copied from GraphX, it's fixed, and I fixed all the other places it shows up in the repository\n- I changed the use of relative imports in all the files that I edited and @liancheng has already offered to update the rest of the code at some point.\n- I did a bunch of minor updates to the docs.  More things are private, and the examples should now copy/paste and cleanly execute into the spark-shell.\n- Regarding SQLContext serialization errors, I'm not sure why they happen and they don't even seem to happen reliably.  I'd guess it has something to do with implicits.  Regardless, you are like the third person to have problems with this, so I just went ahead and made SQLContext serializable, making all of its fields `@transient`.  I checked that this worked in the spark-shell, even when explicitly included in a closure.\n- For the SQLParser case sensitivity, that trick only works for RegExParsers, not TokenParsers.  It would be a lot of work (if even possible) to convert to a RegExParser.  I'd rather switch to a real parser down the road.\n- For the file names, I fixed the mentioned instances where the name did not match the class.  Regarding the use of lowercase filenames, I think this is a case where we unnecessarily deviate from the Scala style guide.  From a discussion with Patrick on this subject:\n\n> From the scala style guide: \n> \n> > All multi-unit files should be given camelCase names with a lower-case first letter. This is a very \n> > important convention. It differentiates multi- from single-unit files, greatly easing the process of \n> > finding declarations. These filenames may be based upon a significant type which they contain \n> > (e.g. option.scala for the example above), or may be descriptive of the logical property shared \n> > by all units within (e.g. ast.scala). \n> \n> I think when there are just support classes and one main parent class the Spark convention \n> seems reasonable.  But due to all the tree objects in catalyst we often have groups of small, \n> related classes in a single file, with no clear parent class.  So I think where we use the camel \n> case convention it is materially different than in Spark.\n> \n> If you really think this is going to cause problems though I can change it :)\n- I also added a suite of tests that exercise the non-hive SQL pathway.  This exposed an issue with self-joins of RDDs that is also now resolved.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/38127613/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/38128525","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/182#issuecomment-38128525","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/182","id":38128525,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MTI4NTI1","user":{"login":"AmplabJenkins","id":4031291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzEyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4031291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/AmplabJenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-03-20T02:02:10Z","updated_at":"2014-03-20T02:02:10Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Merged

Spark has historically leaned towards providing a simpler, leaner API in order to be easier to learn and develop. With this goal in mind, I think we should avoid the -X style options for now until we get clear use-cases for each. I understand that this mechanism is very convenient for testing out different options, but users can always achieve this goal by writing some harness code like you have here, but I don't think it should intersect with the tools we want all spark users to be using.\n\nI like the inclusion of --master, the renaming of --driver-memory/--executor-memory, and the reorganization of the script. I think before merging, though, the following changes should be made:\n- Removal of all options currently under \"Other options\" except --master and --log-conf. Since --log-conf would be the only thing in \"Other options\" we should probably just go ahead and merge it into \"Basics\" and rename \"Basics\" to just \"Options\".\n- Removal of DRY_RUN variable.\n- Remove VERBOSE but allow us to log the base directory, Spark Master, and REPL options if --log-conf is set.\n- Revert --executor-cores to --cores. Otherwise this may confuse users, since it's not at all related to --executor-memory (which sets per-executor memory) while --executor-cores sets the total number of cores that the spark-shell asks for from the scheduler.\n- If no MASTER is defined, default to \"local\" to avoid a behavioral regression.\n\nI also like the inclusion of --jvm-debug for the same reason as --log-conf, I think debugging options are useful. However, we can save that for a future patch, I think.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/38129776/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/38130617","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/88#issuecomment-38130617","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/88","id":38130617,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MTMwNjE3","user":{"login":"mateiz","id":228859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODg1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz","html_url":"https://github.com/mateiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-03-20T02:51:07Z","updated_at":"2014-03-20T02:51:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Jenkins,

one thread.\n\nIf we were adding support for local today a variant of this PR would be a\ngood default to choose.\nI am not convinced about the need to break compatibility in this case - yes\nwe have ability to break compatibility, but we should be careful while\ndoing so.\nParticularly when the behaviour was explicitly documented.\n\nThere are bunch of MT unsafe code which uses local (should have been\nlocal[1], but they were documented to be the same until now) and/or cluster\nmode with num cores == 1\n\n> We use availableProcessors() elsewhere in the Spark codebase, and here it\n> is used only as a reasonable default. \"local\" mode is only intended for\n> testing purposes, so the impact and severity of this change is limited.\n\nWe use that api in only one other place - which is pretty similar to this,\nand is also fairly dodgy.\n\n'local' is very commonly used by our users, so it is not restricted to\ntesting (if it was just testing, modifying the code to use higher value\nwould be the solution).\nIf the intention is to ensure good out of the box use of all cores of a\nsystem when users try/play with spark - then would be better to point users\nto local[N] and specify that we are running with a single thread via some\nlog message.\n\n> (Also I'd like to point out that the tests that needed to be modified were\n> actually making false assumptions about partition ordering that just\n> happened to work out since it was using 1 thread.)\n\nThat would point to probably broken tests.\nWe should not assume the number of workers a test would be run on (except\nfor scheduler tests, etc ofcourse !).\n\nRegards,\nMridul\n\n> ## \n> \n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/182#issuecomment-38132716\n>
