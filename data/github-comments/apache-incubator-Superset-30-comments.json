see this cycle of errors, and am unable to load caravel via a browser;\n\n```\n2016-08-19 13:53:56,890:INFO:flask_appbuilder.base:Registering class PermissionModelView on menu Base

@mistercrunch \nI'll try adding nginx to the mix and report back.\n\nJust for kicks, I tried testing this to get an idea of where this might be breaking down.  Here's a very simple app that just does a re-direct from '/a' to '/b'.\n\n```\n# app.py\nfrom flask import Flask, redirect, url_for\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/a')\ndef a():\n    return redirect(url_for('b'))\n\n@app.route('/b')\ndef b():\n    return 'you made it!'\n```\n\nAnd testing this in straight-up Flask, the 'X-Forwarded-Proto' header is not recognized. (Notice the Location is https even though the header requested https.)\n\n```\n$ FLASK_APP=app.py flask run\n...\n$ curl -Ik -H \"X-Forwarded-Proto: https\" localhost:5000/a\nHTTP/1.0 302 FOUND\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\nContent-Length: 211\nLocation: http://localhost:5000/b\nServer: Werkzeug/0.11.10 Python/3.5.2\nDate: Sun, 21 Aug 2016 22:52:23 GMT\n```\n\nAnd running with gunicorn it _does_ handle the 'X-Forwarded-Proto' header.  (Notice the Location is https now.)\n\n```\n$ gunicorn -b 127.0.0.1:5000 app:app\n...\n$ curl -Ik -H \"X-Forwarded-Proto: https\" localhost:5000/a\nHTTP/1.1 302 FOUND\nServer: gunicorn/19.1.0\nDate: Sun, 21 Aug 2016 22:53:13 GMT\nConnection: close\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\nContent-Length: 211\nLocation: https://localhost:5000/b\n```\n\nSo gunicorn looks like it should be doing the right thing.\n\nI think this can be closed since I believe the problem is not in Caravel.  And I'll update this issue with whatever I learn.\n\nthanks,\nDennis\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/241287851/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/241299360","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/682#issuecomment-241299360","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/682","id":241299360,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MTI5OTM2MA==","user":{"login":"justabot","id":20650283,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjUwMjgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20650283?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justabot","html_url":"https://github.com/justabot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justabot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justabot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justabot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justabot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justabot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justabot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justabot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justabot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justabot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-22T02:00:20Z","updated_at":"2016-08-22T02:00:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I
