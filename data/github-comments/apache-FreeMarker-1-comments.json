So that's why it's like it is.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/freemarker/issues/comments/241080382/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/freemarker/issues/comments/241180305","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/freemarker/pull/13#issuecomment-241180305","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/freemarker/issues/13","id":241180305,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MTE4MDMwNQ==","user":{"login":"jacopoc","id":5541043,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDEwNDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5541043?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacopoc","html_url":"https://github.com/jacopoc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacopoc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacopoc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacopoc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacopoc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacopoc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacopoc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacopoc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacopoc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacopoc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-20T05:14:55Z","updated_at":"2016-08-20T05:14:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you Daniel for the explanation.\nI was actually confused by the following sentence from the same README file:\n\"You need JDK 8(!), Apache Ant and Ivy to be installed.\"\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/freemarker/issues/comments/241180305/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/freemarker/issues/comments/241185158","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/freemarker/pull/13#issuecomment-241185158","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/freemarker/issues/13","id":241185158,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MTE4NTE1OA==","user":{"login":"ddekany","id":342341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjM0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/342341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany","html_url":"https://github.com/ddekany","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-20T07:34:45Z","updated_at":"2016-08-20T07:36:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Java 8 is because of the build tools.

That's a very simple concept to understand for the users. But it becomes unwieldy if you build a complex systems of templates (which I don't think was expected by the authors originally). So namespaces and `#import` was added. Even with the \"only include once\" feature, the reusable files will have no own namespace, so they aren't well separated, which can be a maintenance problem. \r\n\r\nI don't think we should support this pattern, which we don't want users to follow, in the core (which is already quite bloated). How about you create a `TemplateDirectiveModel` , and use it like `<@includeOnlyOnce>... your current template content comes here ...</@includeOnlyOnce>`? It could get the template name from the `Environment`.\r\n\r\nSome notes, both for the current implementation, and for the possible `includeOnlyOnce` implementation:\r\n\r\n* You should suppress output printed inside the template that's \"only included once\". Surely you don't want that, as it should be transparent if something is included for the first time or not.\r\n\r\n* \"Only once\" should mean once per namespace, and not once per `Environment`.\r\n\r\n* Deciding based on `Template` object identity if something was already ran won't be good enough, because `Configuration.getTemplate` might returns a different instance for the same name if the cache behind was evicted (also there's actually no hard guarantee that it caches at all).

The most important bit is that people want to call the \"legitimate\" Java API-s of the objects that were exposed to the template. I'm not talking about `?api` here, but about how \"generic\" java objects, aka POJO-s, are normally exposed. Like in `user.name` (probably calls `User.getName()`), `users.forRole('admin')`, etc., you utilize that. Then, they will also access the objects that these methods return, and so on, potentially a huge graph of objects. Plus, even when the class of a deliberately exposed POJO is developed, as these domain classes are usually not just for the templates, the developer doesn't constantly consider that any public method they adds will be callable from templates. So, I think, in most real world scenarios, it's not feasible to keep API access under control without whitelisting. The whitelist will be specific to the application, and, of course, it's far from a boolean switch. It's not possible to make a simple safety on/off switch.\r\n\r\nRegarding frameworks that doesn't let you configure FreeMarker, yet doesn't care to configure it properly itself. What can I say... they just didn't care then. In any real world project, you will want to configure FreeMarker, even if the security aspect doesn't matter. Given how tricky fencing malicious template authors is (see linked FAQ entry), we have no much chance in forcing security on such a framework.\r\n\r\nWhat can we still do? If we go for extremes, then, we could introduce some static method where you can set up a callback, and where you can modify the new `Configuration` before it's returned from the constructor. But that's a horrible thing to do. That hook will affect all libraries that internally use FreeMarker (in case there happens to be more in the same application), not just the one you intended to target. You could target by look into the stack trace, or via thread local storage, if you are lucky though. You also can't know what settings will the framework set after the constructor, and hence, after your callback. Sure, then we could have an API to capture those setter calls as well, so you can override them... now that starts to be really awkward. Also it can be far from obvious for others, that these hooks exist somewhere, causing these mysterious changes, which can cause lot of confusion. So, I really hate the idea, but that's the most I can imagine for \"forcing\" security.\r\n\r\nSo, I'm afraid, realistically, the framework authors, who \"own\" the `Configuration`, has to care about security, and mostly, about the safety of the data-model. If they they do care about the data-model, probably they will also care about configuring the other aspects (disabling this and that), as that's really the easier part. If they try to do that, and have difficulties, then, like in the recent versions, we may add features to help there. But they have to \"opt in\".","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/freemarker/issues/comments/646900936/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/freemarker/issues/comments/646983915","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/freemarker/pull/68#issuecomment-646983915","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/freemarker/issues/68","id":646983915,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0Njk4MzkxNQ==","user":{"login":"ChangdongLi","id":1704262,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDQyNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1704262?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChangdongLi","html_url":"https://github.com/ChangdongLi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChangdongLi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChangdongLi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChangdongLi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChangdongLi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChangdongLi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChangdongLi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChangdongLi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChangdongLi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChangdongLi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-20T11:39:59Z","updated_at":"2020-06-20T11:39:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi ddekany, thanks for your detailed response. we already sanitized the templates and used a hardcoded FreeMarker version which has those advanced features removed. it doesn't allow executing external commands and initializing new instances.

You wouldn't be able to access anything but basic functionality of Map-s, Collection-s, arrays, strings, numbers, booleans and dates. We couldn't expose anything about POJO-s (unless method where explicitly whitelisted, or annotated as template accessible). I'm not sure if that would make sense as a default, as it's unusable in the usage pattern that FreeMarker was originally made for. (Also as a default it would be highly backward incompatible, but that's a different topic. But it can't be on out of the box in 2.x.x for sure.)\r\n\r\nThe attacks described in said blog post doesn't work out-of-the-box on FreeMarker 2.3.30, as some key methods used there were blacklisted, as they are very unlikely to be used (and then still can be turned back on). Also, AFAIR, the whole attack there starts with a privilege escalation attack (not related to FreeMarker), so users who are not supposed to can edit templates. Anyway, I asked them to link to the relevant FAQ entry at least, to no avail.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/freemarker/issues/comments/647102391/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/freemarker/issues/comments/662299184","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/freemarker/pull/69#issuecomment-662299184","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/freemarker/issues/69","id":662299184,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2MjI5OTE4NA==","user":{"login":"ddekany","id":342341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjM0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/342341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany","html_url":"https://github.com/ddekany","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-22T07:45:23Z","updated_at":"2020-07-22T07:45:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Indeed, thanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/freemarker/issues/comments/662299184/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/freemarker/issues/comments/702729813","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/freemarker/pull/70#issuecomment-702729813","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/freemarker/issues/70","id":702729813,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwMjcyOTgxMw==","user":{"login":"TrackerSB","id":6358523,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNTg1MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6358523?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrackerSB","html_url":"https://github.com/TrackerSB","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrackerSB/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrackerSB/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrackerSB/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrackerSB/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrackerSB/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrackerSB/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrackerSB/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrackerSB/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrackerSB/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-02T13:19:40Z","updated_at":"2020-10-02T13:19:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Just to mention: I tested the modification with my own modular Java project and it works.
