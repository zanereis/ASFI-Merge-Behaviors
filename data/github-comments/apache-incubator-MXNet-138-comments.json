Thanks for your suggestion. I've thought about this and it's indeed the ideal way. \r\n\r\nI think we have the same opinion on 'using TensorBoard in MXNet without `import tensorflow`'(that's weird XD), and this PR mainly focus on the easier and faster way to let our users use this cool visualization tool without `import tensorflow` in their MXNet code, they just need `import tensorboard` which we have already provided in MXNet as a python package(as you suggest, that's the logging part). \r\n\r\nAs for the rendering part(step two), I have to pull out all relevant code of TensorBoard and put it in DMLC/TensorBoard and figure out a way to keep it easy to update with its original, cause TensorBoard could actively update and we have to keep it easy-to-maintain. \r\n\r\n### Discussion: Possible solution of building TensorBoard(the rendering part)\r\n\r\nAs I noticed in installing tensorflow:\r\n\r\n`pip install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/tensorflow-0.8.0-py2-none-any.whl`\r\n\r\nand TensorBoard's doc:\r\n\r\n> Or, if you are building from source:\r\n> bazel build tensorflow/tensorboard:tensorboard\r\n\r\nSo is it a good/possible way to provide tensorboard like this? Then user install MXNet, they just need a tensorboard in requirements.txt which could be easily installed by `pip install dmlc/tensorboard`? I mean if we could write a script to strip the relevant code of TensorBoard from TF and make it a `.whl` file so all we have to do it's to maintain this script. As it's too difficult to maintain a bunch of code and keep it same with the upstream.\r\n\r\nJust an immature idea, do you think it's possible?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/266192041/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/266198972","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/4176#issuecomment-266198972","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/4176","id":266198972,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NjE5ODk3Mg==","user":{"login":"howard0su","id":766788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2Njc4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/766788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/howard0su","html_url":"https://github.com/howard0su","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/howard0su/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/howard0su/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/howard0su/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/howard0su/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/howard0su/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/howard0su/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/howard0su/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/howard0su/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/howard0su/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-10T10:38:29Z","updated_at":"2016-12-10T10:38:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I don't agree. \r\n\r\nFirst the original code is wrong, which can cause two layer weights didn't pull from reduced vgg16 model.\r\nSecond, as example, the top priority is demonstrate the right way to things.\r\nThird, consider the model is not the best model it can be.

In [line 26](https://gist.github.com/uzhao/8ceeedfc5b87d45987b9fcaa2847299b#file-r-L26) of your code you assign a `label` variable, but as far as I can tell this is never attached to the labels of the training data.\r\n\r\nUnless by giving it the name `label` it is automatically treated as such (in the same way the `data` symbol is attached to the features because it has been given the name `data`). I'm afraid I'm not very familiar with the mx.symbol API so the above may not make that much sense.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/266242585/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/266244063","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/4173#issuecomment-266244063","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/4173","id":266244063,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NjI0NDA2Mw==","user":{"login":"anjishnu","id":2019824,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTk4MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2019824?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anjishnu","html_url":"https://github.com/anjishnu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anjishnu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anjishnu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anjishnu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anjishnu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anjishnu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anjishnu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anjishnu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anjishnu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anjishnu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-10T22:21:12Z","updated_at":"2016-12-10T22:21:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1, great work.

Does smooth-l1 look good? If so, check classification sub-network.\r\n2. Make sure data and labels are correct, as well as the pretrained parameters.\r\n3. Tune learning rates and batch size\r\n4. Modify parameters, such as scaling and normalization, this is where you could focus more on, since you are using different base network (squeezenet) than vgg16. This is tricky, squeezenet's feature is a bit thinner than vgg16(192/256 filters vs 256/512), and has different hierarchy, and output scale might be different. So make sure you know what you are doing when designing the new structure. Try enabling normalization at all feature layers that have very large outputs.\r\n\r\nEnable monitor and observe the outputs/weights/gradients could give you more insights of the network and training status. Good luck.\r\nPlease report if you have good results using squeezenet, thanks very much.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/266305244/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/266307891","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/3603#issuecomment-266307891","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/3603","id":266307891,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NjMwNzg5MQ==","user":{"login":"boofhead","id":7209911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyMDk5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7209911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/boofhead","html_url":"https://github.com/boofhead","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boofhead/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boofhead/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boofhead/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boofhead/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boofhead/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boofhead/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boofhead/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boofhead/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boofhead/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-11T21:05:59Z","updated_at":"2016-12-11T21:05:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"No, mx.modelFeedforward.create should detect an R array and create an `mx.nd.array` iter.
