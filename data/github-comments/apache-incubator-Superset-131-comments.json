This is probably a silly question but what would the best way be to go about getting the proper version of this? Probably just using the one from the commit before or should redoing the `yarn install` set it straight?\r\n- Releasing the feature: Perhaps it'd be fine to just have a script that sets all dashboards to published since this wouldn't affect the system at all and then people would just be able to modify it from then on? Even though 28 days-ish seems like a reasonable cutoff, this just seems minimally invasive.\r\n- Toggling status in dashboard view and not just CRUD: Great idea, this commit adds some of that functionality. I've added an icon right next to the favorite icon to show whether or not it's published. I built it primarily off of the FavStar component as well. It's not currently working completely.\r\n- About chart privacy: The charts do get more cluttered but I don't know if they're browsed as a final product in the same way as dashboards. Also wondering how this would interact with adding charts to dashboards, would people only be able to see published charts?\r\n- SQL Generated: I'd be interested in knowing this too. I know that I can go to each of the `Filter`s and print out the query before and after any transformations but am not sure how to find out what things look like before applying either filter and afterwards. Any quick ideas on how to do this? I haven't looked into it much.\r\n\r\nThings to do:\r\n- The route I created for modifying the status `superset/dashboard/<id>/published/<action>` returns a 302. I haven't dug into it too much yet but perhaps you know what I need to do to address this.\r\n- Show user their favorited dashboards in the list.\r\n- Test non-owners trying to modify the published status\r\n- Show generated SQL from using multiple base_filters\r\n\r\nThanks again for your feedback!

for your comment. here are my thoughts:\r\n\r\n1. I don't like the idea of delete v1, it will destroy code history and make huge duplicates, huge merge conflicts, and very hard to track the changing or fixing of existed features. \r\n\r\nDashboard v2 will provide a lot of new features new components, but most of existed functionalities will be carried over, like filters, chart render, refresh and immune etc. We will add new functions/components to improve the layout and organization of Dashboard, not switch to branch new project.\r\n\r\n2. Naming: I don't have good idea about redux state keys. Please feel free to recommend.\r\n\r\n`charts` are dynamic queries. Each of chart is basically a query based on saved params + dashboard added filter. Most of its attributes are dynamic, like request params, response data, start time, last updated time etc.\r\n\r\n`allSlices` mapped to `slices` table in backend. They are static data for those saved queries (after save query as slice), like name, owner, datasource name, timestamp, param list, etc. These data are used to help user review, filter, sort all existed slices, then they can add new slices into dashboard. Different than chart data that is fetched one by one, available slices data should be fetched all together and only once.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/380604576/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/380605682","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/4798#issuecomment-380605682","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/4798","id":380605682,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MDYwNTY4Mg==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-11T21:45:17Z","updated_at":"2018-04-12T19:39:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/4798?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#4798](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/4798?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/commit/dadc0574b84ccf047987766ddc2a4c7efff638eb?src=pr&el=desc) will **increase** coverage by `0.08%`.\n> The diff coverage is `100%`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/4798/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&height=150&token=KsB0fHcx6l&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/4798?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@            Coverage Diff             @@\n##           master    #4798      +/-   ##\n==========================================\n+ Coverage   72.38%   72.46%   +0.08%     \n==========================================\n  Files         208      208              \n  Lines       15526    15530       +4     \n  Branches     1203     1203              \n==========================================\n+ Hits        11238    11254      +16     \n+ Misses       4285     4273      -12     \n  Partials        3        3\n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/4798?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [superset/viz.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/4798/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-c3VwZXJzZXQvdml6LnB5) | `80.35% <100%> (+0.84%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [...set/assets/javascripts/explore/stores/controls.jsx](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/4798/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-c3VwZXJzZXQvYXNzZXRzL2phdmFzY3JpcHRzL2V4cGxvcmUvc3RvcmVzL2NvbnRyb2xzLmpzeA==) | `38.88% <0%> (+0.86%)` | :arrow_up: |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/4798?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/4798?src=pr&el=footer).
