The `resetHDFSResources()` method handles Kerberos setup options prior to calling `getFileSystemAsUser()`, which includes calling `preProcessConfiguration()` that subclasses can override to adjust the `Configuration`.  Existing subclasses do not appear to do anything that would influence the file system type, so as long as that doesn't seem like a concern, changing the behavior to fail validation instead of throwing the AccessDeniedException during scheduling sounds like a better approach.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/740983198/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/740996110","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4712#issuecomment-740996110","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4712","id":740996110,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0MDk5NjExMA==","user":{"login":"bbende","id":605416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTQxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende","html_url":"https://github.com/bbende","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-08T20:40:24Z","updated_at":"2020-12-08T20:40:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ah that is a good point that I had not considered.

I.e., code that was written against a Object[] will still compile against a vararg. But if it was already compiled against Object[], will it run okay when the method is changed varaarg? That needs to be verified before we merge.\r\n\r\nThis could be tested by building this branch, and then copying in a processor from 1.12.1, for instance, and verifying that the logging is still working properly. If so, then I'm good with the changes.\r\n\r\nRegarding the unit test for ParseEvtx: I would just delete the assertion all together. It's testing that something got logged at a warn level. Anything. As long as that log message was the only one and it had some arguments. That's a very odd set of constraints to put on the log message. I would also avoid the change here to an explicit log message. IMO. it is always a bad practice to write unit tests that make assertions against human-readable text. I.e., log message, Exception messages, etc. Those can change at any time in order to make the message more clear, and doing so should never result in a unit test failure.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/743432494/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/743440913","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4687#issuecomment-743440913","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4687","id":743440913,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0MzQ0MDkxMw==","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-11T21:40:15Z","updated_at":"2020-12-11T21:40:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@thenatog Thanks for the review and testing.

I performed this test in both Java 8 and 11.\r\n\r\nAlso, the odd log statement verification in ParseEvtxTest was removed completely.\r\n\r\nI do not see any remaining issues. Please merge.\r\n\r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/744693725/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/744844252","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4286#issuecomment-744844252","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4286","id":744844252,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0NDg0NDI1Mg==","user":{"login":"sjyang18","id":41694933,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNjk0OTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41694933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjyang18","html_url":"https://github.com/sjyang18","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjyang18/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjyang18/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjyang18/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjyang18/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjyang18/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjyang18/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjyang18/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjyang18/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjyang18/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-15T00:01:28Z","updated_at":"2020-12-15T00:01:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I

Based on the code changes, I think this should apply to all dialogs. Of note, in order to verify that, I had to click on one of the text boxes / inputs within the form and then press shift-tab to get to the tabs. Otherwise, just pressing tab jumped all over the place, as it selected elements in the background (like the search box) even though there was a dialog open.

I think this is a helpful feature. Looking at the PR, the code looks good. I think the UI needs a bit of tweaking, though. This results in the text boxes now being more narrow so that they can't even hold a UUID without an ellipsis. And I think we need to use a different heading than \"NOT\" to indicate that a field should be inverted. Also, while this adds a \"Fields\" and \"NOT\" column header that is in the same font as the \"Start Date\" text, etc. it feels a bit off to use that styling for the newly added column headers.\r\n\r\nBut my UI/UX skills are nil :) So while I can tell you that I think it needs some tweaking, I won't be great at suggesting exactly how it should be tweaked.

It has the potential to break a lot of things. Any component that previously declared a property to reference a RecordLookupService would no longer be able to use this service, and that component would become invalid. And any component that declared a property as a LookupService that previously worked as expected could start to behave very differently. Consider that a REST service previously had a response that had 3 records, and it just returned the first one. Now it returns 3. That can result in all kinds of problems in the users' data.\r\n\r\nHowever, I can understand the desire to support returning multiple Records. So we could either have a separate implementation (with shared, common code), or we could add a property that determines what to do if multiple records are returned (defaulting to return the first record in order to maintain backward compatibility). Adding the property comes with 2 downsides, though. (1) It means that the Controller Service still would no longer be a RecordLookupService but just a `LookupService<List<Record>>`. This is probably ok, though. I don't think we even have anywhere in the codebase where we expect a RecordLookupService explicitly to be configured. (2) The default really should be to return multiple records, not to return the first and ignore the rest. But defaulting to that would change the default behavior in a very unexpected way for some users.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/754208111/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/754210723","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4513#issuecomment-754210723","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4513","id":754210723,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1NDIxMDcyMw==","user":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-04T20:49:49Z","updated_at":"2021-01-04T20:49:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ottobackwards changes look good to me.

The \"Fields\" column header currently exists in the same style as \"Start Date.\"   I just used added \"NOT\" to use the same style to be in sync with how \"Fields\" looks.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I agree that this style for a column header is underwhelming and your overall point is a correct observation.\r\nSo will make them nicer as part of this ticket...  \r\n    ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/754282945/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/754329946","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4738#issuecomment-754329946","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4738","id":754329946,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1NDMyOTk0Ng==","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-05T01:39:47Z","updated_at":"2021-01-05T01:39:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@pvillard31 Thanks for the feedback and changes, looks good.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/754329946/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
