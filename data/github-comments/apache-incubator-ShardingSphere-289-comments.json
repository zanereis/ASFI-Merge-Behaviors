I thought about a similar solution. Referring to the processing ideas of https://github.com/baomidou/dynamic-datasource-spring-boot-starter , I think it is possible to add the global configuration `Map` of `hikaricp`, `dbcp` and `tomcat dbcp` under `spring.datasource.shardingsphere` (with these JDBC pool is used as an example because the source code of `shardingsphere` imports these three components as the implementation of the metadata spi). The data source instance can automatically extends these automatic configurations, and the configuration in the data source instance will override the globally configured JDBC pool properties. But the `shardingsphere proxy` is being retrofitted with `vert.x client`, which makes me wonder if it will be too complicated.\r\n```yaml\r\nspring:\r\n  datasource:\r\n    dynamic:\r\n      hikari:
