But I could give some advises that may help you.\r\n\r\n## Deploy Zookeeper\r\n\r\nIn order to deploy Zookeeper in an easy way, you should use a popular Docker image. It's good to have a service for Zookeeper pods that can be accessed by agents and collectors.\r\n\r\n## Delpy collector cluster\r\n\r\nThe key step is to config proper pod network for the collector as @wu-sheng described. The simplest way is to use StatefulSets and HeadlessService.\r\n\r\nThen the collectors can access each other by using stable network id which is either Pod hostname or Pod DNS.\r\n\r\nThe deployment of other components isn't too special to give more details.\r\n\r\nHope these guides make sense to you.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/393049119/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/393087875","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/1285#issuecomment-393087875","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/1285","id":393087875,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MzA4Nzg3NQ==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-30T09:07:33Z","updated_at":"2018-05-30T09:07:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@ascrutae If the hytrix makes more complex than we expected, please consider #1284 as an option.
