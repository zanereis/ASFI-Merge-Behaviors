See snippet:\r\n\r\nI understand why we need `$ORIGIN` set for private library. \r\nBut I don't quite understand we need it at build time: Conan test_package can help ensure `$ORIGIN` in the installed binary works as expected.\r\n\r\nBUILD_RPATH is just a convenience feature.\r\nSee https://github.com/apache/celix/commit/eccbb7f9be7958b5724e8569164e8c14052abcae and https://github.com/apache/celix/pull/569/commits/514a71e8fc55501976f2867bc5359d9635d484d2 for examples.\r\n\r\n> a) Link against the required bundle dependency libraries so that during bundle loading the needed libraries can be found\r\n\r\n`target_link_libraries(rsa_json_rpc PRIVATE ${RSA_JSON_RPC_DEPS})` has already done this for `Celix::dfi`,  if we have the default `BUILD_RPATH` in place.  \r\n`rsa_json_rpc` does not really need a private copy of `Celix::dfi`.\r\nIMHO, `BUILD_RPATH` is just a convenience feature.\r\n\r\nWill these commits (https://github.com/apache/celix/commit/eccbb7f9be7958b5724e8569164e8c14052abcae and https://github.com/apache/celix/pull/569/commits/514a71e8fc55501976f2867bc5359d9635d484d2) bring about any harm? \r\n\r\n> b) Add required bundle dependency libraries as a private lib / file to the bundle using the libraries\r\n\r\nAs documented in `celix_bundle_private_libs`, the idea of private library does not really work reliably due to the limitation of `ld.so`.\r\nA more reliable way of using private library is to link the private library statically into the shared object built with symbol visibility control and `-BSymbolic`, so that the shared object does not interfere with the outside world.\r\nTo mitigate resulting code bloating,   the techniques in https://github.com/apache/celix/issues/442

following comment confused me:\r\n\r\n```C\r\n    //When removing the event\r\n    celix_bundleContext_removeScheduledEvent(fw->getFrameworkBundleContext()->getCBundleContext(), eventId);\r\n\r\n    //Then the log callback is called at least one more time with a warning log message, because remove\r\n    //callback took too long\r\n    //(note the logCount can be increased more than once, due to another processing thread)\r\n    EXPECT_GE(logCount.load(), 2);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhy a time-consuming remove callback is guaranteed to trigger a warning, given that we never track the duration like we do in `celix_scheduledEvent_process`?\r\n\r\n```C\r\nvoid celix_scheduledEvent_setRemoved(celix_scheduled_event_t* event) {\r\n    if (event->removedCallback) {\r\n        event->removedCallback(event->removedCallbackData);\r\n    }\r\n    celixThreadMutex_lock(&event->mutex);\r\n    event->isRemoved = true;\r\n    celixThreadCondition_broadcast(&event->cond); // for

event->callback(event->callbackData); // note called outside of lock\r\n    struct timespec end = celix_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that either the last check is unnecessary or our implementation of `celix_scheduledEvent_setRemoved` is incorrect. \r\n\r\nIMHO, `ScheduledEventTestSuite.CxxWaitForScheduledEvent` failure is more worrisome, since it can fail on all platforms with various possibilities.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/comments/1631845890/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/comments/1632225435","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/celix/pull/588#issuecomment-1632225435","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/588","id":1632225435,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVuczs5hScib","user":{"login":"PengZheng","id":5362947,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjI5NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5362947?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng","html_url":"https://github.com/PengZheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-12T10:09:07Z","updated_at":"2023-07-12T10:33:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The

The latter is used when no memory allocation is needed. The create function returns a pointer (possible NULL) and the _init returns a celix_status_t or a struct by value.\r\n> Provide a celix_<myObj>_destroy or celix_<myObj>_deinit function. The latter is used when no memory needs to be deallocated.\r\n> If the structure \"guards\" a condition for a scope (lock guard, service registration guard, etc) it should use the naming convention celix_<obj_to_guard>_guard_t (so celix_file_guard_t, or celix_threadMutex_guard_t\r\n\r\nNaming conventions really matter. \r\nThe third one is conceptually consistent and is far better than  the one I've used before. \r\n\r\nThere are two usage patterns with different semantics:\r\n\r\n1. Modify existing types to add autocleanup. Examples include `celix_auto(celix_fd_t)` /`celix_autoptr(celix_string_hash_map_t)`\r\n2. Introduce new type to perform specific actions (`celix_mutex_lock_guard_t`) or to capture cleanup context (`celix_service_registration_guard_t`)\r\n\r\nIt is the second pattern to which the naming convention applies. I have updated all such usages to the suggested naming convention.

When the properties are updated for type support, I expect this will have minimal or no impact on the Event impl.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/comments/1683780959/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/comments/1683808734","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/celix/issues/515#issuecomment-1683808734","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/515","id":1683808734,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVuczs5kXOHe","user":{"login":"pnoltes","id":1766397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NjYzOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1766397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes","html_url":"https://github.com/pnoltes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-18T11:54:03Z","updated_at":"2023-08-18T11:54:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Concerning remote event admin. I think it is wise to start with a local event admin implementation, mostly following the spec (if possible) and only after that start on the remote event admin.\r\n\r\nI also expect that we still need to have a few discussion about the event admin. For example:\r\n\r\n- Are all events remote? Or is this a opt-in per event (e.g. with something like a `event.remote=true` property) or maybe with a special interface (`RemoveEventAdmin`). And do event handlers always receive local and remote events?\r\n- Will the `sendEvent` block until all event local and remote are processed? Will it have a timeout?\r\n- Will the thread or thread used by `postEvent` be configured / plugable?\r\n- Will remote events, pushed to event handlers on a single thread or multiple threads and is this configurable/plugable?\r\n- As mentioned by Peng, can event handler provide back pressure? If so is this a separate service interface?\r\n- Also as Peng mentioned, do we want to support QoS (best effort, reliable, etc)\r\n- Will the technology used for remote be plug-able and how? Maybe something like a distribution provider (as is used in Apache Aries, see https://aries.apache.org/documentation/modules/rsa.html) to make adding a new transport and serialization more easy.\r\n- Will discovery of remote event admins be supported? Or do we only support broker-like solution (MQTT, NATS, etc) (which does not need a discovery only a broker address). If discovery is supported, do implement an separate event admin discovery (like pubsub discovery) or maybe introduce a remote property store interface and implementation which can be used by remote services, pubsub and remove event admin to discover remote endpoints (note that endpoint both in remote service and pubsub are essentially nothing more than a discoverable properties set stored in a configurable path). \r\n- Do we add a wire protocol (as is currently done in pubsub)? This can be used to identify a protocol version (and thus detect if we are remote compatible), add a sync word (and maybe even detect byte order) and optionally provide metadata and/or message fragmentation. \r\n\r\n \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/comments/1683808734/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/comments/1685541427","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/celix/issues/515#issuecomment-1685541427","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/515","id":1685541427,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVuczs5kd1Iz","user":{"login":"xuzhenbao","id":43104033,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTA0MDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43104033?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzhenbao","html_url":"https://github.com/xuzhenbao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzhenbao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzhenbao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzhenbao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzhenbao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzhenbao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzhenbao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzhenbao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzhenbao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzhenbao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-21T02:50:54Z","updated_at":"2023-08-21T02:50:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Will the technology used for remote be plug-able and how? Maybe something like a distribution provider (as is used in Apache Aries, see https://aries.apache.org/documentation/modules/rsa.html) to make adding a new transport and serialization more easy.\r\n\r\nThe technology used to publish remote events should be plug-able. IMO, it might be an event handler proxy and register an event handler service that subscribes to all local events and then pushes events subscribed by remote subscribers to the remote distributor. When the remote distributor receives a remote event, it sends the event to the event admin(use `sendEvent/postEvent`), and event admin publish remote event to subscriber.\r\n\r\n> Will discovery of remote event admins be supported? Or do we only support broker-like solution (MQTT, NATS, etc) (which does not need a discovery only a broker address).\r\n\r\nWe could consider using a broker-like solution and then reuse the discovery of remote service(discovery_zeroconf,etc.) to announce the broker's information. If we use the solution of discovering remote endpoints, we don't know which publisher service endpoints will be created until the `sendEvent/postEvent` interface is called, unless we can get the publisher information in advance by some other mechanism\r\n\r\n> Do we add a wire protocol (as is currently done in pubsub)? This can be used to identify a protocol version (and thus detect if we are remote compatible), add a sync word (and maybe even detect byte order) and optionally provide metadata and/or message fragmentation.\r\n\r\nCould it be based on the remote technology used? If the remote technology is TCP/UDP, we should add a reusable wire protocol. If the remote technology is websocket, since websocket already support message fragmentation, is it possible for the distributor to define its own wire protocol (like `pubsub_websocket`)?\r\n\r\n> Are all events remote? Or is this a opt-in per event (e.g. with something like a event.remote=true property) or maybe with a special interface (RemoteEventAdmin). And do event handlers always receive local and remote events?\r\n\r\nI think event handlers should receive all events that they subscribe to, whether remote or local. If there are no remote subscribers, the event admin should not push the event to the remote, otherwise, it should push the event to the remote. Additionally, to distinguish between remote and local events, we can add an event property, such as `celix.framework.uuid`. And the property should be set by the event admin.\r\n\r\n> Will the `sendEvent` block until all event local and remote are processed? Will it have a timeout?\r\n\r\nWe can start with implementing `sendEvent` to wait until all events are processed. At the same time, according to the OSGI specification [113.8.2](https://docs.osgi.org/specification/osgi.cmpn/7.0.0/service.event.html#d0e47607), we can use a blacklist, blacklisted handlers should not be notified of events.\r\nIf a timeout is really necessary, we can add the new interface `sendEventWithTimeOut`.\r\n\r\n> Will the thread or thread used by postEvent be configured / plugable?\r\n\r\nwe can use threadpool, and the max thread number can be configured by the property of event admin bundle. For event handlers that require a order of events, it should be ensured that its `handleEvent` method is executed in a single thread\r\n\r\n> Will remote events, pushed to event handlers on a single thread or multiple threads and is this configurable/plug-able?\r\n\r\nTo ensure order of events, a single thread maybe be used for the same remote address, but multiple threads maybe be supported for different remote addresses.\r\n\r\n> As mentioned by Peng, can event handler provide back pressure? If so is this a separate service interface?\r\n\r\nWe can use a blacklisting mechanism to limit or disconnect event handlers that take too long in the `handleEvent` method. If an event handler has cached events, it should manage the cached events.\r\n\r\n> Also as Peng mentioned, do we want to support QoS (best effort, reliable, etc)\r\n\r\nConsidering the different requirements for event reliability in different scenarios, we can first implement two QOS policies: at most once, at least once (like MQTT). And set QOS as a property of event.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/comments/1685541427/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/comments/1687815171","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/celix/issues/619#issuecomment-1687815171","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/619","id":1687815171,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVuczs5kmgQD","user":{"login":"PengZheng","id":5362947,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjI5NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5362947?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng","html_url":"https://github.com/PengZheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-22T09:26:28Z","updated_at":"2023-08-22T09:33:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It

Next to caching, could it maybe help to offer a `apache/celix-build` container image where all the dependencies are already preinstalled? This can be used during the CI build of Celix (where dependencies are not re-installed every build and can potentially also be used by current and new developers working on Celix ?\r\n\r\nThat is an interesting idea. I believe this is very doable and there might be some overlap with adding Gitpod support (also based on building in a container image). One of the image layers could be the installation of Conan Celix dependencies. I also expect (note assumption) that caching an image is well-supported and documented.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I would also like to retain the build on Ubuntu and MacOS systems. In my opinion, this demonstrates and proves that Apache Celix is usable on those systems. In other words, +1 for adding a celix-build image and using that in our CI, but in my opinion, this should be complementary to the already existing Ubuntu and MacOS builds.
