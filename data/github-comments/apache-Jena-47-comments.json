default, wait for user to click and then load graphs without count\r\n- Even though we are removing the `COUNT((*)`, that's still required... when you edit the graph, the UI uses that `COUNT` to compare against `MAX_EDITABLE_SIZE`, set in the code to `10000` (from old Fuseki UI)\r\n  - Should we let users try to save very large graphs and possibly overload UI and/or backend? i.e. drop the limit/need for count\r\n  - Or should we load the count when the user tries to save it (or when s/he clicks on it?\r\n\r\nSome screenshots from the current version in this PR:\r\n\r\n(when you open

In an auth related test, there are two HTTP requests - the first attempt results in a 401 and the second with the authentication credentials.\r\n\r\nBut it is not exclusively auth tests failing. With groups of tests running at the same time, other tests that are a single HTTP action fail sometimes. I'm guessing that a group of tests do share some underlying hardware so a batch changes the load on the server -  this is consistent with the build action being more likely to fail at busy times of the EU-US working day.\r\n\r\nThe common factor is creating a Fuseki Server in a Junit `@BeforeClass` and stopping it in `@AfterClass`.\r\n\r\nFrom previous Jena test stability experience, Windows behaves different to Linux in the timing of old ports being collected by the OS kernel and in the way that thread scheduling can cause longer pauses of a thread. That on its own isn't a deep explanation.\r\n\r\ntest on windows can also fail for network reasons on MS Windows - e.g. not being about to fetch node/yarn for `jena-fuseki-ui`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1997327939/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1997420508","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/2333#issuecomment-1997420508","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/2333","id":1997420508,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec53Djfc","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-14T13:06:28Z","updated_at":"2024-03-14T13:06:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@arne-bdt - I can't add you as a reviewer - this may be because your github account isn't in the ASF organisation.\r\n\r\nThis PR removes some warnings there were showing up in the codebase.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1997420508/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1998598246","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/2334#issuecomment-1998598246","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/2334","id":1998598246,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec53IDBm","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-14T22:39:34Z","updated_at":"2024-03-14T22:41:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@rvesse  Please could you change the commit message to `GH-2330: ...`. 2230 is pull request about something different.

This \"on exit\", or sometimes earlier, but still delayed, is the long standing java issue.\r\n\r\nThe situation around compaction is different for Jena 5.0.0 if a previous JVM had a problem in compaction. In 4.x partial, broken compaction could get left around causing a subsequent JVM to encounter problems.  That might be what is occurring in the stacktrace (it isn't conclusive though).\r\n\r\n5.0.0 has compaction robustness - issue #2254.\r\n\r\nPR #2304 added robustness by compacting to a temporary directory, moving it into place using filesystem atomic rename within the same directory. This is the commit step. Then it deletes the old directory before the compacted database is available to the application. (There is a period of vulnerability to external effects, not java factors, between rename and finishing the filesystem delete.)\r\n\r\n#2315 reported that the storage directory can't be renamed into place on MS Windows. The atomic rename above does not work if the directory has memory mapped files.\r\n\r\n#2321 changes MS Windows to write the new database storage into the correct place. It has different compaction robustness by a different clean-up.\r\n\r\nA control file is written which lists the directory to be cleared up the next time this database is opened/connected to. Compaction writes the name of the new database storage directory (the `Data-(N+1)` directory) to the clean up file.\r\n\r\nIf compaction runs smoothly, the old directory, `Data-N`, is deleted; the space is only truly released by the OS when the JVM exits; this is unavoidable. But the system is using `Data-(N+1)`, `Data-(N+2)`, ... as compactions happen successfully.\r\n\r\nIf the compaction does go wrong, there is highest `Data-N` directory that can not be used. Its name is in the control file.\r\n\r\nThe Windows compaction code deletes the control file when the compaction has finished and before the switchover to the new compacted storage and before it is available to the application. Cleaning up the control file is the commit step. There is an equivalent period of vulnerability to external effects.\r\n\r\nCode runs once per JVM per database before using a database for the first time in the JVM. That code understands both Windows-style and Linux-style compactions and so the database folder can still be moved between systems.\r\n\r\nPlease try Jena 5.0.0. After running many Windows github actions and not seeing an occurrence of failure of one of the tests in Jena 4.x that would occasionally fail, I hope this is robust.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/2010731129/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/2012339475","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/issues/2288#issuecomment-2012339475","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/2288","id":2012339475,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec538d0T","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-21T13:41:15Z","updated_at":"2024-03-21T13:41:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":">

instead of a table with three columns, after thinking a bit I thought maybe we could use progress bar like the rest of the uploads, where you have an upload bar per file.\r\n\r\nHere's the first preview. I am prototyping it, but pretend there are files selected and the upload is happening :slightly_smiling_face: \r\n\r\n\r\nThe progress bar starts gray. As it progresses, the blue bar increases. In case of errors, the red bar increases. At the end summing both we will get 100%.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/jena/assets/304786/dcfa856c-e225-4239-aaba-358cda5dc215)\r\n\r\nThe success bar can be green or blue, but I thought green could be confusing because of the select all button (although blue is also mixing with the upload all button). Initially the bars were empty, then I added 30% and 20%, and then I added the 3/10 and 2/10 to have the same information we had before (to answer a question like \"how many files were selected).\r\n\r\nWDYT?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/2016992031/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/2019033851","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/2123#issuecomment-2019033851","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/2123","id":2019033851,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec54WAL7","user":{"login":"kinow","id":304786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDc4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/304786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow","html_url":"https://github.com/kinow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-25T22:30:46Z","updated_at":"2024-03-25T22:30:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Refactored to match what we discussed on Twitter, @neumarcx.

I think this new version at least improves the previous one. Not sure if there are some corner cases covered by the backend that are not handled correctly in JS though...\r\n\r\nThanks @jmkeil
