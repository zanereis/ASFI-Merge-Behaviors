I think as a first step we should not check whether the JM and TM have the same versions because in nearly all cases both classes will be started from the same binaries. If we should decide at a later point that we want to check that all used actors are compatible, then I would vote for using the decoration mechanism to transparently add a version ID instead of adding it manually to a subset of messages. The latter approach is IMO error-prone.\n\nChecking whether the client and the JM have compatible versions should be sufficient. I'm not quite sure whether `getClass().getPackage().getImplementationVersion()` is the right way to go here.

CopyOnWriteList seems a bit overkill.\n\nA nicer way to solve this is IMHO to use a broadcast variable initializer, which would guarantee that the list is sorted once (by the first one that accesses it) and then everyone shares the same sorted list.\n- Less memory consumption (not super critical, as we are talking about small lists)\n- Less work, since only one sort happens per TaskManager, rather than one sort per task.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/135398622/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/135399187","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1046#issuecomment-135399187","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1046","id":135399187,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNTM5OTE4Nw==","user":{"login":"mjsax","id":8959638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NTk2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8959638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax","html_url":"https://github.com/mjsax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-27T11:55:51Z","updated_at":"2015-08-27T11:55:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think the `byte[]`converting approach is the correct way to go.

Having the code in is nice, but we need a way to surface it in the `DataStream` API. The current implementation can not do that in a straight-forward way, as you need the number of output channels in a constructor parameter. That is an information that we do not have when creating the partitioning strategy for the data stream yet (E.g. [here](https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/master/flink-staging/flink-streaming/flink-streaming-core/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/streaming/api/datastream/DataStream.java#L502-L504)).\n2. The comment you have added to `PartialPartitioner` did not give me a clear picture of the behaviour. I much prefer the one you wrote [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-1725?focusedCommentId=14371032&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-14371032). Some comment would be nice on the test side too, I only got it after reading the aforementioned JIRA issue.\n3. How sensitive are your algorithms fed by this partitioning to loosing the state in `targetChannelTasks`? Because if a Flink operator was to go down this information would not be recovered after failure.\n4. I share the wish of @gdfm that it would be really nice if the implementation did not depend on `toString`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/135418178/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/135419765","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/992#issuecomment-135419765","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/992","id":135419765,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNTQxOTc2NQ==","user":{"login":"HuangWHWHW","id":13193847,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTkzODQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13193847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HuangWHWHW","html_url":"https://github.com/HuangWHWHW","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HuangWHWHW/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HuangWHWHW/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HuangWHWHW/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HuangWHWHW/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HuangWHWHW/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HuangWHWHW/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HuangWHWHW/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HuangWHWHW/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HuangWHWHW/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-27T13:08:57Z","updated_at":"2015-08-27T13:08:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mxm \nHi, \nmy test just do the same thing that first pass the Socket\nwhen it calls SocketTextStreamFunction.open.\nThen close the Socket that means send nothing(EOF) to the SocketTextStreamFunction.\nAnd after this it will retry.\nAnd first time the retry happens immediately since SocketTextStreamFunction receives the end of the sent message.\nThen it will get retry second, third... times since I do not open the socket which means a ConnectionError occur.\nSo can you describe more in detail?\nThank you.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/135419765/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/135420490","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1068#issuecomment-135420490","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1068","id":135420490,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNTQyMDQ5MA==","user":{"login":"mbalassi","id":5990983,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5OTA5ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5990983?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi","html_url":"https://github.com/mbalassi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-27T13:10:20Z","updated_at":"2015-08-27T13:10:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for picking up the issue.
