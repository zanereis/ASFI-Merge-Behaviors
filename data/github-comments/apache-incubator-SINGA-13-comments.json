By the way, you should test the `test_onnx_backend.py`.\r\n\r\n@Shashankwer @Alvinnyk @agnesnatasya \r\nThere are two points I should explain a little more:\r\n\r\n```\r\nonnx_node.set_attr_inputs(onnx_node.inputs[1], 'depth')\r\nonnx_node.set_weight_inputs(onnx_node.inputs[2], 'scale')\r\n```\r\n`set_attr_inputs` means in [ONNX Operator Schemas](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/master/docs/Operators.md), they regard an element as input, but we regard it as an attribute, so we mark the second input `onnx_node.inputs[1]` as attribute `depth` in SINGA.\r\n\r\n`set_weight_inputs` means in [ONNX Operator Schemas](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/master/docs/Operators.md), they regard an element as input and they store its value, but we regard it as a weight in `layer.py`. so we mark the third input `onnx_node.inputs[2]` as weight `scale` in SINGA.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/comments/645838557/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/comments/645873692","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/singa/issues/707#issuecomment-645873692","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/707","id":645873692,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0NTg3MzY5Mg==","user":{"login":"dcslin","id":13751447,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzUxNDQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13751447?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcslin","html_url":"https://github.com/dcslin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcslin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcslin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcslin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcslin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcslin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcslin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcslin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcslin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcslin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-18T08:43:28Z","updated_at":"2020-06-18T08:43:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Yes

I just saw your PR of ScatterElements.\r\n\r\nI guess you can implement the NonMaxSuppression firstly, it's easier than RoiAlign. There are some operators we cannot support for RoiAlign, for example, the crop. But the NonMaxSuppression is straightforward now. \r\n\r\nYou can follow this one:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/master/torchvision/ops/boxes.py\r\n\r\nAnd for RoiAlign, we have found an implement on GitHub, we're discussing how to implement on python or c++.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/longcw/RoIAlign.pytorch","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/comments/654043371/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/comments/654138655","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/singa/pull/755#issuecomment-654138655","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/755","id":654138655,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1NDEzODY1NQ==","user":{"login":"lgtm-com[bot]","id":43144390,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDMxNDQzOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/17324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/lgtm-com","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-06T10:01:21Z","updated_at":"2020-07-06T10:01:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This pull request **introduces 2 alerts** when merging 745e8e50cb429f8e527abef2ef2f8983c61fc212 into 67ca2a4bbe7ffabfe7f4fc6e534589161ba97a15 - [view on LGTM.com](https://lgtm.com/projects/g/apache/singa/rev/pr-5d8b1b14c7dfe19fb6e33e0217e2ea261f7a5722)\n\n**new alerts:**\n\n* 2 for Unused import","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/comments/654138655/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
