Certainly it is not the way I intended the `FileObject.getLookup()` to be - it was supposed to provide all services representing the _selected file object_.\r\n\r\nOf course, should there be any performance consequences, I can write the longer complex lookup code.

the test was more tough than I expected. Why it failed: the Maven Problems inspector traverses artifacts (project.getArtifacts()), direct dependencies. Notes those that are not locally available. Earlier commits in this fix added \"faked\" artifacts created during project read. But I didn't pay attention to that these fakes are only created for POMs - not jars, but metadata of those jars. The resolver wrappers introduced by aaeabe1 allows to trace POM request back to the original artifact (which may have pom packaging !) and report that one. Final normalization of the missing artiact is done by ignoring artifact scope, as the scope is somewhat lost during the artifact resolution process - but it does not matter, the artifact was touched and needed during the project read. Without these steps, the Problems view either does not catch all problems, or displays duplicities (the same artifact in default and compile scope, for example).\r\n\r\nMaybe the problem reporter could be rewritten to use recursive dependencies, or rely on Maven reading infrastructure with catching errors in resolver wrappers, so the info comes from a single source.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1947934398/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1948013019","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/7040#issuecomment-1948013019","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7040","id":1948013019,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M50HFHb","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-16T09:14:07Z","updated_at":"2024-02-16T09:14:07Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I did also learn that\r\n```\r\nmvn dependency:resolve-plugins\r\n```\r\nis not a good way to debug plugin dependency trees since it will list its original dependencies, better method would be:\r\n```\r\nmvn -X nbm:nbm\r\n```\r\nthis would show the asm downgrade right away\r\n\r\nGood luck with the rest of the JDK 21 upgrade, don't forget the surefire plugins etc NetBeans will also mark possible dependency updates directly in the pom which might help.\r\n\r\nclosing the issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1948013019/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1948123353","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/6671#issuecomment-1948123353","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/6671","id":1948123353,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M50HgDZ","user":{"login":"0k00l","id":44671095,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NjcxMDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44671095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/0k00l","html_url":"https://github.com/0k00l","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0k00l/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0k00l/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0k00l/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0k00l/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0k00l/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0k00l/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0k00l/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0k00l/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0k00l/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-16T10:28:43Z","updated_at":"2024-02-16T10:28:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Same here, Netbeans version: 20.

The summary only speaks about ensuring missing ActionProvider does not cause NPEs, which certainly sounds correct - it is OK for projects to not have any particular service in their Lookup. Besides that, this change appears to modify the Lookup used for `isActionEnabled`, but only for that, not for `invokeAction`. I guess my concerns so far are:\r\n- adding the whole `FileObject.getLookup()` - but I understand this may match the usual content of the Lookup when running inside the whole NetBeans GUI, so this is not a huge concern.\r\n- adding the whole `Project.getLookup()` - this seems a bit more troublesome. Project Lookups are not (AFAIK) required to contain the reference to the Project (so this is potentially a breaking change), and also contain various services which may interact with global services, etc. Unless the corresponding Lookup in NB GUI contains the *content* of the current Project, then I'd be much happier if this was dropped.\r\n- please correct me if I am wrong, but: these changes are made only to the Lookup used for `isActionEnabled` (\"test Lookup\"), but not to the Lookup used for `invokeAction` (\"invoke Lookup\"). Sorry, but this seems clearly wrong to me. The invoke Lookup must be a (proper or improper) superset of the test Lookup, IMO. I.e. with this change, it seems to me the test Lookup contains `DataObject`, but the actual invoke Lookup does not(?). Not sure what is the `ActionProvider` that relies on `DataObject`s then supposed to do? (The Enso provider expects `DataObject` in `isActionEnabled` and `FileObject` in `invokeAction` - that is OK, but `ActionProvider`s should not be forced to balance between `DataObject`s and `FileObject`s this way.)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1948309816/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1948618773","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/4527#issuecomment-1948618773","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4527","id":1948618773,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M50JZAV","user":{"login":"szymach","id":2230556,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzA1NTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2230556?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szymach","html_url":"https://github.com/szymach","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szymach/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szymach/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szymach/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szymach/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szymach/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szymach/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szymach/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szymach/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szymach/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-16T15:28:15Z","updated_at":"2024-02-16T15:28:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Does this explain my meaning, or should I also include how it should happen in the IDE?\r\n\r\n```php\r\n\r\nnamespace Demo;\r\n\r\nuse function in_array;\r\n\r\nclass someClass \r\n{\r\n    public function someMethod(string $key): bool\r\n    {\r\n        return in_array($key, ['a value'], true);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1948618773/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1948697529","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/4527#issuecomment-1948697529","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4527","id":1948697529,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M50JsO5","user":{"login":"junichi11","id":738383,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczODM4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/738383?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11","html_url":"https://github.com/junichi11","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-16T15:50:59Z","updated_at":"2024-02-16T15:50:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> should I also include how it should happen in the IDE\r\n\r\nYes, well, it would be nice if you write your exact steps, an actual result, and an expected result.\r\n\r\n1.

But I don't think I have the file named projectui.properties you're talking about in my folder. Just a file named ui.properties. And for your other questions, when I used netbeans the year before last, everything was fine.  Last month, I needed to start using Netbeans again because of a certain project and it didn't work properly when I opened the project. But open file can work properly. Yes, I have tried uninstalling the NB and tried a lot different versions of NB. Everytime before my installation, I will clean the previous one's cache. But they all showed the same problem that can't open project.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1950295198/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1950958980","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/6952#issuecomment-1950958980","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/6952","id":1950958980,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M50SUWE","user":{"login":"junichi11","id":738383,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczODM4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/738383?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11","html_url":"https://github.com/junichi11","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-18T04:30:26Z","updated_at":"2024-02-18T04:30:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Unfortunately, I can't reproduce it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1950958980/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1950963112","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/6952#issuecomment-1950963112","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/6952","id":1950963112,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M50SVWo","user":{"login":"Torchify911","id":156535119,"node_id":"U_kgDOCVSJTw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/156535119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Torchify911","html_url":"https://github.com/Torchify911","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Torchify911/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Torchify911/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Torchify911/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Torchify911/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Torchify911/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Torchify911/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Torchify911/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Torchify911/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Torchify911/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-18T05:03:04Z","updated_at":"2024-02-18T05:03:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for looking into it.

Please see:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/7059#issuecomment-1948964918\r\n\r\nb) I would like to hear rationale for including `prj.getLookup()` rather than just `prj`.

Seems a bit non-standard, and I would be happier if we used just `prj` instead of `prj.getLookup()`.\r\n\r\nI personally don't have so strong opinion for including `file.getLookup()`, so I'll leave to up to you and Svata.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1953057556/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1953078843","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/6426#issuecomment-1953078843","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/6426","id":1953078843,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M50aZ47","user":{"login":"zarinfam","id":1052394,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTIzOTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1052394?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zarinfam","html_url":"https://github.com/zarinfam","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zarinfam/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zarinfam/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zarinfam/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zarinfam/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zarinfam/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zarinfam/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zarinfam/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zarinfam/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zarinfam/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-19T19:49:36Z","updated_at":"2024-02-19T19:49:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I have this problem with Java Platform Support for VS Code as well!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1953078843/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
