I agree with @miguelaferreira.\nI have looked that code.\nThe select it runs is the following: \nselect h.id from host h where h.status = 'Up' and h.hypervisor_type is not null  and h.data_center_id = ? ORDER by rand() limit 1\n\nThat makes me wondering, why ordering by random the projection?! That can make problems harder to debug. Whatever, that is not the focus here.\nThe only ways I see that select returning nothing are the following:\n• If we have no hosts in the zone;\n• If all of the hosts have hypervisor_type equal to null, is it even possible to have a host with hypervisor_type = null?\nI would be concerned about the first case, a zone with no hosts. Thus, we should have to check when the method “com.cloud.hypervisor.ovm3.resources.Ovm3HypervisorGuru.performSideEffectsForDelegationOnCommand(long, Command)” is called. \nWhat API method ends up in that code, or what action of ACS is going execute it?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/155415964/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/155418071","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/935#issuecomment-155418071","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/935","id":155418071,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NTQxODA3MQ==","user":{"login":"nvazquez","id":5295080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyOTUwODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5295080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez","html_url":"https://github.com/nvazquez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-10T13:25:13Z","updated_at":"2015-11-10T13:25:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@wilderrodrigues Thanks a lot Wilder!\n\n@miguelaferreira Thanks for following this PR and testing it!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/155418071/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/155426180","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1055#issuecomment-155426180","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1055","id":155426180,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NTQyNjE4MA==","user":{"login":"remibergsma","id":1630096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzAwOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1630096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma","html_url":"https://github.com/remibergsma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-10T13:57:23Z","updated_at":"2015-11-10T13:57:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Jenkins error seems unrelated:\n\n```\n[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-surefire-plugin:2.18.1:test (default-test) on project cloud-server: Execution default-test of goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-surefire-plugin:2.18.1:test failed: The forked VM terminated without properly saying goodbye.

That is actually my point, if the register does not matter, I would rather order by id DESC or ASC and not at random (of course, I would maintain the limit 1 clause); because that way if something happens I think it would be easier to track the problem. \n\nAdditionally, as you pointed that out, I think if the host == null, throwing an exception is a better way to go.\n\nBTW: I was staring at that code now, and something hit me. \nThe method “org.apache.cloudstack.storage.endpoint.DefaultEndPointSelector.selectHypervisorHost(Scope)” returns an object “EndPoint” that contains a random host id. If the host does not matter, why not use the host that we have already loaded in line 113? We could just check if the attribute “hypervisor_type” is not null for that host; that is what the select in “selectHypervisorHost” method is doing.\n\nI also noticed that you created two new exceptions, would not it be better for us to use the already known “CloudRuntimeException”? Instead of creating other exception types.\nI think there was a problem with Jenkins, JVM crash ?!\nI will also take a look at PR #1057.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/155515107/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/155517568","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1057#issuecomment-155517568","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1057","id":155517568,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NTUxNzU2OA==","user":{"login":"rafaelweingartner","id":4129005,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjkwMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4129005?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelweingartner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-10T18:09:43Z","updated_at":"2015-11-10T18:09:43Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@DaanHoogland, pretty good job, you created the test cases and removed the return null cases.\nI just have one question, why you use a cast for the octal value “0xffffffff” to long?

Shouldn’t we create a PR changing the Java compilation level to 1.8?\n\n@DaanHoogland, I still have a doubt about the need of that “selectHypervisorHost” method call. If you take a look at the stack of calls, the method that starts the process is “com.cloud.hypervisor.HypervisorGuruManagerImpl.getGuruProcessedCommandTargetHost(long, Command)” that method makes me think that we could just use the host that it receives as a parameter instead of looking for another one.\n\nWhat is the point on getting a host at random? There was not even a check if the hypervisor type of the host that was selected is the same as the host that initiated the whole process.\n\nMoreover, line 79 of “getGuruProcessedCommandTargetHost”, already uses the hypervisor type of the host that is being sent as a parameter; I am not seeing why that call “endPointSelector.selectHypervisorHost” is needed. It seems that we could just remove lines 114 and 115 in Ovm3HypervisorGuru.java (prior to the modifications that @DaanHoogland did) and we would be good to go, without much complications.\n\nThe same happens for XenServerGuru.java, lines 193 and 194.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/155545730/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/155553509","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1056#issuecomment-155553509","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1056","id":155553509,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NTU1MzUwOQ==","user":{"login":"DaanHoogland","id":2486961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODY5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2486961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland","html_url":"https://github.com/DaanHoogland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-10T20:18:03Z","updated_at":"2015-11-10T20:18:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rafaelweingartner I think the method configures the host to have the right storage endpoint.

I am using Xen; and that method is used when creating a template from a snapshot; the CS will execute the code: “com.cloud.hypervisor.XenServerGuru.getCommandHostDelegation(long, Command)”\nACS: 4.3.2\nXen (4.1) + XAPI (1.6), those components together are basically the same as a xenserver 6.0. The difference is that we use Debian as our OS and not CentOS.\n\nLook at what happened in my test, the hostHd received in the “XenServerGuru.getCommandHostDelegation” method was (100).\n\n“XenServerGuru.getCommandHostDelegation” loaded the host data from host table to retrieve the dataCenterID, and then executed “endPointSelector.selectHypervisorHost”, that ended up selecting a host that has the id (87) which is in a different cluster. Then it created the “EndPoint” object that does not do much; there is a configure method “org.apache.cloudstack.storage.RemoteHostEndPoint.configure(Host)” that is called, but it merely retrieves some data from the host object that was sent as a parameter. After that in line 161 of “XenServerGuru.getCommandHostDelegation” it is loaded the host data using the host id of the “EndPoint” object; then we check if the host (87) has a fix “snapshotHotFix”; in my case, the host did not have, so it ended up returning the original host id (100) at line 170.\nEven if the host (87) had the “snapshotHotFix”, I do not understand why it is getting a host at random in the environment; If the host does not matter, why not use the host that the method already received as a parameter?\n\nThe name of the method “org.apache.cloudstack.storage.endpoint.DefaultEndPointSelector.selectHypervisorHost” does not say much, and its execution does not make much sense to me. I believe it can be removed without any harm.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/155821415/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/155831862","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1056#issuecomment-155831862","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1056","id":155831862,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NTgzMTg2Mg==","user":{"login":"DaanHoogland","id":2486961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODY5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2486961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland","html_url":"https://github.com/DaanHoogland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-11T16:16:25Z","updated_at":"2015-11-11T16:16:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rafaelweingartner nice analysis. meaning, all of my change is senseless.
