I think we should refer to [taco](http://tensor-compiler.org) for the code generation part in tvm, especially for the unified sparse tensor structure. However, we would very likely to support the runtime for cuda, opencl and many other backends, therefore I think it is necessary to implement code generation in tvm.\r\n\r\nIn my observation, there are two categories of algorithms that extensively use sparse tensor operations to speed up convolution. First, people depends on high sparsity of weight tensor to speed up 2D image convolution, which requires retraining the network weights to increase the sparsity. Second, sparse tensors are used to represent point cloud dataset and its processing steps, where sparse tensors are used to represent features instead of weights in a convolution operator. In many cases, we might need to implement direct sparse convolution as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/402046229/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/402157621","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/1371#issuecomment-402157621","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1371","id":402157621,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMjE1NzYyMQ==","user":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-03T13:29:52Z","updated_at":"2018-07-03T13:29:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"is the last commit related to this PR?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/402157621/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/402159608","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/1371#issuecomment-402159608","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1371","id":402159608,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMjE1OTYwOA==","user":{"login":"srkreddy1238","id":14215163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjE1MTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14215163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238","html_url":"https://github.com/srkreddy1238","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-03T13:36:31Z","updated_at":"2018-07-03T13:36:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes.
