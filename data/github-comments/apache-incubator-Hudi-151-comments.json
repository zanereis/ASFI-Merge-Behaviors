from my understanding, MOR table will have high cost during the reading than COR. Especially in our case, we have duplicated rows in the delta commit which needed to be handled during the reading time. Reading time is kind of more of concern for us. Please correct me if my understanding is wrong and please let me know if you guys have any clue on improving the `upsert` spark job performance, either from Spark side or Hudi side.\r\n\r\nAnd I have another concern actually, I found that there are still duplicates existing after I done the `bulk_insert` table migration using `SimpleKeyGen ` with CopyOnWrite table type. The count of duplicate numbers is same as the table using `NonPartitionedKeyGen `.

When more and more APIs are introduced, we have to re-write many logics and re-implement action-to-file-change translations. This resulted in the testutils having cumbersome code and learning hurdle, also error-prone. I felt some re-design is needed. \r\n\r\nSome thoughts on the re-design: developers are familiar with HoodieXXXClient so we would need `HoodieTestTable` make use of some client with similar public APIs, say `HoodieTestTableClient`. \r\n- HoodieTestTable owns a HoodieTestTableClient and exposes the client's APIs for dev to prep their own data\r\n- HoodieTestTableClient should manipulate timeline and metadata as normal\r\n- For UTs don't need real data, the client writes out empty log and base files.\r\n- For FTs, the test table and client should be aware of the EngineContext set by `XXXFunctionalTestHarness` and act like the actual clients\r\n- Eventually dev only learn APIs provided by `HoodieTestTableClient` to prep their tests. It can include high-level APIs like `.write100RecordsIn3Partitions()` as such.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/914038407/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/914042334","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/3394#issuecomment-914042334","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3394","id":914042334,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM42ey3e","user":{"login":"maddy2u","id":7676511,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NzY1MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7676511?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maddy2u","html_url":"https://github.com/maddy2u","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maddy2u/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maddy2u/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maddy2u/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maddy2u/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maddy2u/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maddy2u/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maddy2u/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maddy2u/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maddy2u/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-07T06:57:09Z","updated_at":"2021-09-07T06:57:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you Sivabalan !

Thanks for sharing the steps to reproduce. Is there any specific reason you want to register Hudi table in Glue Catalog in advance? Typically, if you write with the data and hive sync is enabled, then the registration in the catalog happens automatically.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/914303768/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/914315442","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/3617#issuecomment-914315442","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3617","id":914315442,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM42f1iy","user":{"login":"novakov-alexey-zz","id":11204284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjA0Mjg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11204284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/novakov-alexey-zz","html_url":"https://github.com/novakov-alexey-zz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/novakov-alexey-zz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/novakov-alexey-zz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/novakov-alexey-zz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/novakov-alexey-zz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/novakov-alexey-zz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/novakov-alexey-zz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/novakov-alexey-zz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/novakov-alexey-zz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/novakov-alexey-zz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-07T13:39:52Z","updated_at":"2021-09-07T13:39:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@codope I have an empty dataset which is used in Spark SQL as a table for joining with other tables.
