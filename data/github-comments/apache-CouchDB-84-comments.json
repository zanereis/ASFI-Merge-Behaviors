I've only had a few hours to spend reviewing this today and it'll take me a day or two to let it all soak in but there's a few things I'd like jot down while they're paged in.\r\n\r\nMy first major impression is that there's an awkward cross over between couch_views and the new mango fdb modules. AFAICT, this is mostly due to the way that mango jobs stop indexing once they reach the version stamp where they were created along with being able to just update a single document. It would seem to me that if we just added these two bits as optional features of couch_views it would slim down this entire PR considerably. It might also be worth getting the basic async-index-update mango working before jumping to having the single transaction updates. It feels as there's some criss cross between the changes for a new fdb combined with changes for the incremental updates that aren't quite gelled together.\r\n\r\nThe changes to fabric2_fdb need to be redone. There shouldn't be a single mention of mango in that module. There are a number of features that will want to know about db changes that should all share a single interface.\r\n\r\nFor the PR itself, this should definitely be split up into smaller chunks of logic that are described individually. The last one or two might be a fairly large commit but there's a lot of churn that could be processed more efficiently stepping through individual commits. If you need help on how to break down a large commit I'd happy to pair with you to show you the basic git commands for handling that.\r\n\r\nI really like your build status concept. I'd like to extend that for views as well to show initial build vs incremental update that would be useful for operators. Moving that status under a prefix would also give us the necessary structure for efficient view cleanups as well which I'm looking at working on next.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/591107069/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/591253253","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/2592#issuecomment-591253253","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/2592","id":591253253,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MTI1MzI1Mw==","user":{"login":"jaydoane","id":51209,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMjA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51209?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaydoane","html_url":"https://github.com/jaydoane","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaydoane/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaydoane/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaydoane/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaydoane/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaydoane/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaydoane/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaydoane/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaydoane/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaydoane/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-26T05:53:03Z","updated_at":"2020-02-26T05:53:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I couldn't figure out how to re-target to master without pulling in 150 other commits, so I just cherry picked onto a new branch and opened a [new PR](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/2600)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/591253253/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/591291514","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/2598#issuecomment-591291514","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/2598","id":591291514,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MTI5MTUxNA==","user":{"login":"garrensmith","id":179458,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTQ1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/179458?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith","html_url":"https://github.com/garrensmith","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-26T08:02:35Z","updated_at":"2020-02-26T08:02:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for the review @nickva I've made all the changes\r\n\r\nIn terms of logging the error. I've going with this approach for a two main reasons:\r\n\r\n1. It is the same as what views does already for when an error occurs while indexing a document in couch_js\r\n1. It should be straightforward for a user that is monitoring their logs to create some kind of event that is triggered when they get the size errors.

Although I admit my 15 min reading of the spec could miss it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/591981275/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/591986140","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/2602#issuecomment-591986140","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/2602","id":591986140,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MTk4NjE0MA==","user":{"login":"iilyak","id":9804420,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MDQ0MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9804420?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iilyak","html_url":"https://github.com/iilyak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iilyak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iilyak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iilyak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iilyak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iilyak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iilyak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iilyak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iilyak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iilyak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-27T14:01:25Z","updated_at":"2020-02-27T14:01:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The `expect` argument is only used in `./test/elixir/test/auth_cache_test.exs`\r\n```\r\n./test/elixir/test/auth_cache_test.exs\r\n59:    resp = Couch.login(user, password, :fail)\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/591986140/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/592020554","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/2597#issuecomment-592020554","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/2597","id":592020554,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MjAyMDU1NA==","user":{"login":"tsloughter","id":36227,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MjI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36227?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsloughter","html_url":"https://github.com/tsloughter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsloughter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsloughter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsloughter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsloughter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsloughter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsloughter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsloughter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsloughter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsloughter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-27T15:26:03Z","updated_at":"2020-02-27T15:26:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Ah ok, now I get what you are doing.\r\n\r\nFor B3 I think they actually have a \"debug\" header that you can send without id's that is meant to force a trace.

For example, I see a lot of response times of 10,003-10,005ms, almost as if there's been some sort of timeout at 10,000ms\r\n\r\nExactly. There is a timeout. What the timeout means is that as long there are changes on the source, it will stream them. There could be say 100M documents and they should all stream out. Then, after they are all done and the stream is all caught up, it will sleep / wait for 10 more seconds to see if there would be more changes coming. Then if there are no more changes, the feed will timeout and stop. The replicator will then start a new request from the last update sequence.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat timeout is part of the normal replication protocol.  When I measure requests latency for example I always exclude _changes feeds as they have these long running connections that skew the results.\r\n\r\nThat timeout parameter is also derived from a setting you can configure:\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/config/replicator.html#replicator/connection_timeout\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd it is `connection_timeout / 3`. If you know you only replicate locally, you can set that value to something lower. So example if it is set to 6000 (msec), then the `timeout` in the _changes requests will be 2000 msec which is 2 seconds. However that also means that idle replication will continuously restart their requests every 2 seconds which doesn't seem that great but if you want that it's something you can configure.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/592760943/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/592765935","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/2612#issuecomment-592765935","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/2612","id":592765935,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5Mjc2NTkzNQ==","user":{"login":"nerdvegas","id":1632842,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzI4NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1632842?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerdvegas","html_url":"https://github.com/nerdvegas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerdvegas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerdvegas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerdvegas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerdvegas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerdvegas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerdvegas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerdvegas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerdvegas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerdvegas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-28T22:52:39Z","updated_at":"2020-02-28T22:52:39Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Ah ok, well all is good if this is to be expected.\r\n\r\nHowever, is there any way I can remove the effect of _changes from the avg response times stats returned on _stats?
