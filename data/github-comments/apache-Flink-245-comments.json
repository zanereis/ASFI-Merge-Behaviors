looked into the problem @GJL reported and I think it is not caused by killed TMs which don't have the chance to tell the JMs about the slot allocations (even though this can theoretically happen). In such a case, the protocol currently relies on the slot request timeout on the JM side to resend new requests.\r\n\r\nI think the actual problem is related to #5980. The problem there is that the `ExecutionGraph` does not wait until all of its slots have been properly returned to the `SlotPool` before it is restarted in case of a recovery. Due to this, it might happen that some of the old tasks occupy some slots which are actually needed for the new tasks. If this happens, the actual task to slot assignment might be suboptimal meaning that the tasks are spread across more slots than needed. For example, assume that we have two slots with a mapper and sink task:\r\n\r\n`S1: M1_old, S1_old`\r\n`S2: M2_old, S2_old`\r\n\r\nNow a failover happens and the system restarts the `ExecutionGraph`. When this happens `M1_old` and `S2_old` have not been properly released.\r\n\r\n`S1: M1_old`\r\n`S2: S2_old`\r\n\r\nNow we try to schedule the new tasks which suddenly needs 3 slots.\r\n\r\n`S1: M1_old, S1_new`\r\n`S2: M2_new, S2_old`\r\n`S3: M1_new, S2_new`\r\n\r\nAfter the old tasks have been released it would like that:\r\n\r\n`S1: S1_new`\r\n`S2: M2_new`\r\n`S3:M1_new, S2_new`\r\n\r\nWith @GJL tests we had the situation that we could only allocate one additional container due to resource limitations. Thus, if we actually needed 2 additional container, the program could not start.\r\n\r\nBy properly waiting for the slot release such a situation should no longer happen.\r\n\r\nHowever, #5980 does not solve the problem of early killed TMs which could not communicate with the JM. At the moment we would have to rely on the slot request timeouts to resolve this situation.\r\n\r\n I also prefer @StephanEwen first proposal to fix it. This would basically mean that we introduce a new signal which is sent to the JM whenever the RM realizes that a TM has died. It is then up to the JM to decide what to do with it. The simplest approach would be to simply fail the respective slot allocation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/387811150/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/387816955","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/5860#issuecomment-387816955","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/5860","id":387816955,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NzgxNjk1NQ==","user":{"login":"glaksh100","id":6556511,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTY1MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6556511?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glaksh100","html_url":"https://github.com/glaksh100","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glaksh100/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glaksh100/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glaksh100/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glaksh100/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glaksh100/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glaksh100/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glaksh100/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glaksh100/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glaksh100/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-09T17:37:12Z","updated_at":"2018-05-09T17:37:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@fhueske  I gave it some thought and your suggestion makes sense to me.

That's why it is in `flink-core` and not in a Kafka connector project. It is used by various per-record streaming sources, like Kafka, RabbitMQ, in the future PubSub, or AMQ. It may be valuable to migrate Kinesis also to that. This PR changes the common denominator to have very Kafka-specific fields.\r\n\r\n  - The common schema makes sense because we can offer a library of implementations, like for Avro, Json, Thrift, Protobuf. All connectors can use hardened implementations for these types, or integrations with schema registries.\r\n\r\n  - This surfaces for example in the SQL / Table API, which is currently making an effort to change their source API to have \"connector\" and \"format\" aspects orthogonal. You define a table as \"from kafka with Avro\", or \"from row-wise file with JSON\", etc.\r\n\r\n  - We should think of having something similar in the future in the unified batch/streaming DataStream API as well, when we rework our source interface.

Add a default value supplier on the state descriptor (this approach). Advantage is that you can use this to backwards compatibly handle the previous cases of default values (including the starting value for folding state)\r\n  2. Add a `T getOrDefault(Supplier<T>)` method to `ValueState`. This might me almost simpler to do even, and more flexible as it allows for different default values in different contexts. This can get inefficient though when users naively create an anonymous class for the supplier (probably not a big deal any more since lambdas) and it breaks with the current approach, meaning we two

Which way should we go here?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/388411274/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/388423100","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/5993#issuecomment-388423100","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/5993","id":388423100,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4ODQyMzEwMA==","user":{"login":"kl0u","id":2405800,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDU4MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2405800?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u","html_url":"https://github.com/kl0u","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-11T16:58:48Z","updated_at":"2018-05-11T16:58:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the work @sihuazhou and for reporting this @florianschmidt1994 !

looks great but let's please separate the intra-cluster SSL configuration options from the external-cluster options.  In particular, the web/API endpoints should be governed by a different keystore and truststore than are the internal endpoints.  Likewise, the \"hostname verification\" option should pertain only to external connectivity.\r\n\r\nMy rationale is that:\r\n1. the truststore to be used for internal connectivity must be highly restrictive; it should never be the system truststore.  Meanwhile, the truststore for external connectivity (e.g. from the Flink REST client) should typically be the system truststore.\r\n2.  The certificate to be used for internal connectivity may simply be a generated certificate.  Meanwhile, the certificate for external connectivity should be obtained from a cluster CA.  For example, in K8s the user is likely to use a cert obtained from the cluster CA and with a CN corresponding to a Service resource (`flink.default.svc.cluster.local`). \r\n\r\nThe whole issue of using a restrictive truststore for internal connectivity has been discussed on various Akka forums, for example [this PR](https://github.com/akka/akka/pull/23568#issuecomment-331919364).    Keep in mind that Akka has no authorization layer; any authenticated client is considered authorized.   Therefore, a liberal truststore (such as the system truststore) would present an extremely low barrier of entry since public SSL certs are easy to get.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/388490377/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/388547985","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/5997#issuecomment-388547985","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/5997","id":388547985,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4ODU0Nzk4NQ==","user":{"login":"yanghua","id":2283778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODM3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2283778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua","html_url":"https://github.com/yanghua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-12T11:15:19Z","updated_at":"2018-05-12T11:15:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"cc @zentol ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/388547985/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/388548476","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/5834#issuecomment-388548476","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/5834","id":388548476,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4ODU0ODQ3Ng==","user":{"login":"yanghua","id":2283778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODM3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2283778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua","html_url":"https://github.com/yanghua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-12T11:24:36Z","updated_at":"2018-05-12T11:24:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"cc @zentol ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/388548476/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/388554386","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/5997#issuecomment-388554386","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/5997","id":388554386,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4ODU1NDM4Ng==","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-12T13:13:41Z","updated_at":"2018-05-12T13:13:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This does fix the issue, but I'd like to extend this a bit.
