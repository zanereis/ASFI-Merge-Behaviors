@haohui @fhueske I am very interested in `DISTINCT`,  Let me share some ideas about this:\r\nFirst up, in standard database there are two situations can using `DISTINCT` keyword. \r\n*  in `SELECT Clause`, e.g.: `SELECT DISTINCT name FROM table` \r\n*  in `AGG Clause`, e.g.: `COUNT([ALL|DISTINCT] expression)`,`SUM([ALL|DISTINCT] expression)`, etc. \r\n\r\nIn this post,we talk about  `AGG Clause`. The `DISTINCT` keyword tells the database system to aggregate only the distinct, or unique, values within the scope of the aggregate function. i.e. database system will deal with the `DISTINCT` keyword, and put the unique value into `AGG`. Based on this understanding, I think FLINK FRAMEWORK(not the AGG) should deal with the `DISTINCT` keyword. we do not need `DistinctAccumulator.java`. About GROUP WINDOW, I think I like analyze whether the data is duplicated in `XXXWindowFunction` and `DataSetXXXAggFunction`, And add Map[String, Boolean] variable Mapping `aggName -> isFirstTimeProcess`( identifies whether the data is duplicated as a parameter of `GeneratedAggregationsFunction`. `GeneratedAggregationsFunction` process data according to `aggCall.isDistinct`(we must keep this boolean value in GeneratedAggregationsFunction) and `isFirstTimeProcess`. What do you think? @haohui @fhueske \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nSunJincheng","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/298480171/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/298520555","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3801#issuecomment-298520555","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3801","id":298520555,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5ODUyMDU1NQ==","user":{"login":"shixiaogang","id":11361724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzYxNzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11361724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shixiaogang","html_url":"https://github.com/shixiaogang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shixiaogang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shixiaogang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shixiaogang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shixiaogang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shixiaogang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shixiaogang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shixiaogang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shixiaogang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shixiaogang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-02T07:17:49Z","updated_at":"2017-05-02T07:17:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @gyfora I am very happy to hear from you. The following are the answers to your questions. Kindly let me know if you have any idea of them.\r\n\r\n1. The incremental checkpoints supports rescaling. It's true that the implementation checkpoints files directly for multiple key groups together. But in the cases where the degree of parallelism changes, the files will be passed to all the state backends whose key groups are in the files. Then the backends will iterate over all the key-value pairs in the files and pick up those kv pairs that belong to them.\r\n\r\n2.  In the cases we restore from a full snapshot (which is formatted as key-value pairs), the next incremental checkpoint will contain all the files. It may seem a little bit inefficient because i intend to make each checkpoint self-contained. Given that full snapshots and incremental snapshots are in different formats, we have to take a \"full\" incremental snapshot as the base for following checkpoints.\r\n\r\n3. That is a very good question. It will be flexible that users can choose the scheme of checkpoints (say one full checkpoint after n incremental checkpoints).  But i think making every checkpoint incremental is acceptable because incremental checkpoints are more  efficient in most cases. Those backends which do not support incremental checkpointing can still take full snapshotting.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/298520555/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/298534562","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3697#issuecomment-298534562","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3697","id":298534562,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5ODUzNDU2Mg==","user":{"login":"sunjincheng121","id":22488084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDg4MDg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22488084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121","html_url":"https://github.com/sunjincheng121","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-02T07:49:02Z","updated_at":"2017-05-02T07:49:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Rebase code from master.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/298534562/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/298548233","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3766#issuecomment-298548233","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3766","id":298548233,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5ODU0ODIzMw==","user":{"login":"fanyon","id":26474079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDc0MDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26474079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fanyon","html_url":"https://github.com/fanyon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fanyon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fanyon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fanyon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fanyon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fanyon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fanyon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fanyon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fanyon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fanyon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-02T08:17:53Z","updated_at":"2017-05-02T08:17:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"As discussed above, I have updated the API and code.
