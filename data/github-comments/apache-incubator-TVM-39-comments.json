Here is a summary of my takes:\r\n\r\n## Significance\r\nSo far, there is a two-level separation of \"expressions\", the scalar index expression as in the compute body, and the tensor relation dataflow as in the chains of operators defined by the compute (topi).\r\n\r\nIdeally, we want to ask: is it possible to also use tensor data type expressions within the compute themselves. Conceptually this offers a sense of \"recursion\". That is why this proposal is quite significant as it takes a step toward the direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pros \r\nIt offers an alternative to the current tensorize:\r\n- The current tensorization requires everything being declared in scalar form, and mix match the tensor intrinsics\r\n- The proposed \"tensor_op\", allows us to directly put tensor_intrin(which implies a tensor level relation) as part of the body to specify the compute rule for a \"region\" instead of a single scalar index.\r\n   - could be useful when the region is hard to pattern-match, because essentially we are doing the pattern matching directly by invoking the intrinsic and pass in the variables.\r\n- It offers the first step toward \"recursive, region level\", can be useful for cases for example \r\n\r\n## Cons\r\nThere are certain drawbacks of abusing this notion vs tensorize\r\n\r\n- It is somewhat a violation of compute/schedule separation because the pattern matching step is done at the compute stage.\r\n   - This is, however, a practical consideration that is good for short-term but nevertheless need to keep in mind. \r\n   - We do need to keep this in mind\r\n- Divergence with the current tensorization API, and making tensor intrinsic black box\r\n   - The current proposal offers a nice solution to this problem and reuses tensor intrinsic for both tensorize and \"tensor_op\", which I really like\r\n   - This also means \"tensor_op\" is no longer blackbox, because if we want, we can replace the compute declaration and recover the original form\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/412591063/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/412592769","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/1485#issuecomment-412592769","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1485","id":412592769,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMjU5Mjc2OQ==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-13T17:10:18Z","updated_at":"2018-08-13T18:38:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"My last post list summarizes some of the considerations. Due to the significance of this proposal,  we would like to invite the community to have a good discussion on APIs. Specifically, we want to reach the following goals\r\n\r\n- Natural consistency with the compute API, so it feels like a tensor region generalization of compute\r\n- Consistency and reuse of tensorization infrastructure, so user don't get confused between the two and they feel like the APIs designed together.\r\n\r\n## Current Proposal\r\n```python\r\n# tensor_op way\r\ndef tensor_op_vadd():\r\n    A = tvm.placeholder((m/factor, factor), name=\"A\", dtype=dtype)\r\n    B = tvm.placeholder((m/factor, factor), name=\"B\", dtype=dtype)\r\n\r\n    intrin = intrin_vadd(16)\r\n    C = tvm.tensor_op([m/factor,], [factor,],\r\n                      lambda i: [A[i, 0:factor], B[i, 0:factor]], \r\n                      intrin, name='C')\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Mock Design 1\r\nThe tensor intrinsics declaration is the same in the @ZihengJiang 's example\r\n```python\r\n\r\n# tensor_op way, via compute\r\ndef tensor_op_vadd():\r\n    A = tvm.placeholder((m/factor, factor), name=\"A\", dtype=dtype)\r\n    B = tvm.placeholder((m/factor, factor), name=\"B\", dtype=dtype)\r\n    C = tvm.compute((m/factor, factor),\r\n          lambda i: intrin_add(A[i:, 0:factor], B[i, 0:factor]))\r\n```\r\nThe key differences are\r\n- intrin_add is directly overloaded to indicate the invocation of the expression\r\n- The \"internal axis\" is implied via the dimension of the expression.\r\n- Make sure that the \"internal axis\" still exist, but cannot be scheduled\r\n- Note that the dependency can be inference via the expression, as in @ZihengJiang 's PR\r\n\r\n## Mock Design 2\r\n```python\r\n# tensor_op way, via compute\r\ndef tensor_op_vadd():\r\n    A = tvm.placeholder((m/factor, factor), name=\"A\", dtype=dtype)\r\n    B = tvm.placeholder((m/factor, factor), name=\"B\", dtype=dtype)\r\n    C = tvm.compute((m/factor, factor),\r\n          lambda i, j: intrin_add(A[i:, 0:size_of(j)], B[i, 0:size_of(j)]))\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/412592769/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/412614109","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/1501#issuecomment-412614109","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1501","id":412614109,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMjYxNDEwOQ==","user":{"login":"zhreshold","id":3307514,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDc1MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3307514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold","html_url":"https://github.com/zhreshold","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-13T18:16:33Z","updated_at":"2018-08-13T18:16:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@PariksheetPinjari909

for opening this RFC, graph level optimization is an important step in pushing performance in cases were we have to make inter-layer decisions (such as data layout in this case).\r\n\r\nLooking at the code, I think that this is a good opportunity to either refine or more clearly lay out what we should have in our autotvm/general tuning API. Having a good API that is used healthily ensures that we keep things maintainable and gives us confidence that things are extensible.\r\n\r\nTo that end, it may be a good time to discuss how we should organize graph-level and layer-level tuning. We currently already have cost-model tuners that operate on search space; is it natural to extend the notion of a search space to cover possible graphs as well?\r\n\r\nTaking a look at some of the odds and ends of the PR, here's some comments (in no good order):\r\n+ We should be careful when introducing a new \"Executor\" and what the right organization is here. In the past, autotvm has seen a lot of \"Executor\" designs come and go, for good reason (too clunky, too many options, duplicated code, etc.).\r\n+ We should unify the definition of a \"search space\" so that we do not end up having a search space definition style for every hardware backend/template, but rather one that is shared across templates to simplify how tuners can be designed\r\n+ Can we reuse any of the workload definition/extraction code introduced by autotvm?\r\n+ Using lists of RPC hosts/ports is ad-hoc and unnecessary as we have RPC Tracker functionality\r\n+ Can we reuse mic autotvm code e.g., finding all of the factors of an integer?\r\n+ We should avoid introducing a custom, specialized JSON/schedule format for only one backend (autotvm has already defined a generic one).\r\n+ Is the current search space as large as it should be to provide coverage to many x86 CPU types other than C5/AVX-512 e.g., (C4/AVX-2 only, AMD Ryzen ?) We should not shy away from defining a large space search space if it means we can unlock better results through tuning.\r\n\r\nOne main question:\r\nCurrently there seem to be no calls into existing autotvm code; can we not define new tasks that the current autotvm can tune to leverage the existing infrastructure?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/412767691/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/412784616","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/1585#issuecomment-412784616","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1585","id":412784616,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMjc4NDYxNg==","user":{"login":"kevinthesun","id":15520525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTIwNTI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15520525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinthesun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-14T07:47:02Z","updated_at":"2018-08-14T07:47:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Currently graph tuner doesn't use any autotvm code, we should definitely reuse the AutoTVM system to tune kernel. Actually graph tuner is designed to be a standalone module and doesn't couple with any specific tensor tuner. \r\nThings might need to be changed to make this happen:\r\n1. A plain benchmark mode for operator. Graph tuner need to benchmark layout transformation, given input shapes and parameters. We need an interface to run operator given a set of input shapes and parameters. I'd prefer covering this part in AutoTVM(If it's not there yet), since multi-process/RPC module can be reused.\r\n2. Schedule load method. Load schedule with operator index order when calling alter_op_layout, decl and schedule function. Currently this is only done for x86 cpu.\r\n3. A uniform format for schedule template. If AutoTVM already defines one, we just need to modify x86 backend.\r\n\r\nFor the search space question, currently it should be enough for AVX512/AVX2.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/412784616/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/412801146","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/1591#issuecomment-412801146","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1591","id":412801146,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMjgwMTE0Ng==","user":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-14T08:49:53Z","updated_at":"2018-08-14T08:49:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@Jokeren Please tell us when this is ready for review.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/412801146/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/412806042","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/1598#issuecomment-412806042","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1598","id":412806042,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMjgwNjA0Mg==","user":{"login":"srkreddy1238","id":14215163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjE1MTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14215163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238","html_url":"https://github.com/srkreddy1238","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-14T09:07:45Z","updated_at":"2018-08-14T09:07:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@huanglishan6  Can you share the logs ?

absolutely!\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I'd like to thank @nhynes for his initiation. Since three months ago, I've followed his code and learned a lot from his contribution.  Well-done Nick! \r\n\r\nHere're some questions that I need clarifications:\r\n\r\n1) What's the clear and correct way of compiling [tvm-rs](https://github.com/nhynes/tvm-rs)? I'm in Rust nightly 1.30 and cannot compile it? do I need to add/install xargo.toml and compile with that?\r\n\r\n2) What about non-cpu Rust runtime context? don't we want gpu support in Rust for example? I was under the impression that we want the API to be as close as other runtime APIs (Java, Js, Python) but this work doesn't do the job! I know that Rustlang non-cpu support itself is not yet as mature as other mentioned languages, but that doesn't justify to give up on what's possible now. What's wrong with having the exact runtime API support as Java (dylib) for example, as well? (this is exactly what I'm trying to complete in [tvm-rust](https://github.com/ehsanmok/tvm-rust)).\r\n@tqchen Could you enlighten me on the direction?\r\n\r\n3) There's no documentation and example repo for newcomers. In my opinion, this is separate from tutorial considering Rust audience with no ML related experience.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/412968767/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
