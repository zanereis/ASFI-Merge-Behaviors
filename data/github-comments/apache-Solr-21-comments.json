Time to remove the \"Draft\" tag?\r\n\r\nDone 🎉 !  This should be getting pretty close.  I need to merge in `main` to resolve some conflicts and address some remaining review comments, but I've added tests for much of the Jersey functionality, have precommit passing, etc.\r\n\r\nI'd love to get this into shape and merged in time for a weekend of Jenkins feedback, but that might be pushing things a little too much.

It's on a case-by-case basis what work is involved there.  I think your XPath removing work could have incorporated the dis-use of XmlConfigFile because the former logic used many methods of XmlConfigFile whereas afterwards it's only used to pass along the XML Document.  At that point, there's little need of XmlConfigFile; it could be replaced with some utility method on, say, DOMConfigNode that takes some of the same parameters of XmlConfigFile's constructors.

That's what `\"$var[@]\"` does, it basically just puts quotes around the original arguments provided by the user. Using just `$var[@]` will re-split, even if the user has provided an argument like `-query \"*:* - name:Mike\"`, that will be resplit to `\"-query\" \"*:*\" \"-\" \"name:Mike\"`, which is definitely not what we want\r\n\r\nI have added a simple test for export that shows this. Not sure it's completely necessary for package, but I guess I could if we really need to.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1249686311/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1249718818","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/892#issuecomment-1249718818","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/892","id":1249718818,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5KfTIi","user":{"login":"risdenk","id":3384157,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzODQxNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3384157?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk","html_url":"https://github.com/risdenk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-16T19:17:44Z","updated_at":"2022-09-16T19:17:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It might be worth looking at `solr/bin/solr` with `shellcheck` - https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck I ran `main` `bin/solr` through shellcheck and a few of the things you fixed are mentioned there. might help to focus on `errors` and maybe `warnings` since shellcheck can be noisy.\r\n\r\nie: `shellcheck --severity=error solr/bin/solr`\r\n\r\nresulted in the following on `main`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn solr/bin/solr line 833:\r\n  run_tool package -solrUrl \"$runningSolrUrl\" $@\r\n                                              ^-- SC2068 (error): Double quote array expansions to avoid re-splitting elements.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn solr/bin/solr line 879:\r\n    if [ -n \"{$JSTACK:-}\" ]; then\r\n             ^-- SC2157 (error): Argument to -n is always true due to literal strings.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn solr/bin/solr line 1436:\r\n  run_tool export $@\r\n                  ^-- SC2068 (error): Double quote array expansions to avoid re-splitting elements.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn solr/bin/solr line 1441:\r\n  run_package $@\r\n              ^-- SC2068 (error): Double quote array expansions to avoid re-splitting elements.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn solr/bin/solr line 1577:\r\n  run_tool auth ${AUTH_PARAMS[@]} -solrUrl \"$SOLR_URL_SCHEME://$SOLR_TOOL_HOST:${AUTH_PORT:-8983}/solr\" -authConfDir \"$SOLR_HOME\" $VERBOSE\r\n                ^---------------^ SC2068 (error): Double quote array expansions to avoid re-splitting elements.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn solr/bin/solr line 2201:\r\n    echo -e \"    JAVA_MEM_OPTS   = ${JAVA_MEM_OPTS[@]}\"\r\n                                   ^-----------------^ SC2145 (error): Argument mixes string and array.
