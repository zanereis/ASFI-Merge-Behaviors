I have been digging through a bunch of thread dumps over time and there are already many threads and pools already. I would really like to avoid having yet another Thread pool (creating thread pools should be an extremely careful decision).\n  \n  The Akka thread pool executor is quite over-provisioned for the few actors we actually use. I think it is perfectly feasible to use that one for the few extra futures introduced here. In any case, if not reusing the Akka executor pool, then the thread pool needs to be shut down in the TaskManager runner. Otherwise it creates a leak when running successive local Flink jobs.\n- I am a bit consumed about the `SlotEnvironment`. Maybe it is mainly the name, but what does it have to do with the slots? Is it not more like a network-messages specific _JobManager Connection_?\n- The `ResultPartitionConsumableNotifier` could be per `Task` - that way, future multi-JobManager assiciations would work seamlessly and it could directly call `fail(...)` on the Task without having to go through the `TaskManager`. It could probably leave the TaskManager out of the picture completely.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/244082645/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/244088800","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2453#issuecomment-244088800","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2453","id":244088800,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NDA4ODgwMA==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-01T14:04:01Z","updated_at":"2016-09-01T14:04:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for looking into this.\n\nI wonder if we can do this simpler, without changes to the CheckpointCoordinator.\nThe only thing that really needs to change is that without periodic checkpoints, the `startCheckpointScheduler()` method is not called, which means that the JobStatusListener that \"CheckpointActivatorDeactivator\" should not be created and started.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/244088800/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/244093446","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2450#issuecomment-244093446","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2450","id":244093446,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NDA5MzQ0Ng==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-01T14:19:21Z","updated_at":"2016-09-01T14:19:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think these changes are good.\n\nAs a very personal and biased statement: I think the code overdoes it a bit with the \"every parameter on a new line\" policy.

I agree that we should be careful with thread pool creations. At the moment, we create for each `JobManager` and `TaskManager` an additional execution context. The advantage of this approach is that we separate the actor execution from the execution of other components. Thus, it's not possible that another component starves the execution context of the actor and thus influences its responsiveness. But I agree that the few additional future callbacks shouldn't be a big burden for the `TaskManager` actor system. Will change it.\n- It is true that there is no notion of slots on the `TaskManager` right now. I've named it `SlotEnvironment` because with the Flip-6 refactorings we need to maintain multiple job manager connections and every task runs in a slot which is associated with a JobManager. Renaming it to `JobManagerConnection` should better reflect what it actually is.\n- Yes that is a good idea.

The `StandaloneFactory` and the `YarnFactory` should actually only differ in the class of the `TaskExecutor` they start. Furthermore, I think that the network interface selection should not be part of the factory. Instead I would pass the hostname and port to the `createTaskManager(hostname, port)` method which constructs the `TaskManager`. Maybe it makes even sense to pass the `RpcService` via the `createTaskManager(RpcService)` and defer the RpcService creation to the outside method running the select interface method. \n\nThe difference between the Standalone/Yarn and Testing factory is that the first two create the TM components whereas the `TestingFactory` is initialized with the `TaskManager` components.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/244346733/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/244349032","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2461#issuecomment-244349032","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2461","id":244349032,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NDM0OTAzMg==","user":{"login":"zhijiangW","id":12387855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzg3ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12387855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW","html_url":"https://github.com/zhijiangW","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-02T11:17:06Z","updated_at":"2016-09-02T11:17:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tillrohrmann , the current implementation is just follow the previous process for yarn and standalone modes.

Provide specific `TaskExecutorFactory` class instead of abstract factory for both standalone/yarn mode.\n2. Network selection and RPC service creation methods should be pulled out from factory, maybe remove to some utility class?(for JM reuse)\n3. The constructor of `TaskExecutorFactory` supports many different parameters: such as \n`TaskExecutorFactory`(`Configuration`, `ResourceID`)\n`TaskExecutorFactory`(`RpcService`, `HighAvailabilityServices`)\n`TaskExecutorFactory`(hostname, port)\n`TaskExecutorFactory`(`Configuration`, `ResourceID`, `RpcService`, `HighAvailabilityServices`,hostname, port), \nThe above three constructors for partial parameters can be transformed into the fourth final constructor , all the missing parameters can be generated by internal default value.\n4. The `TaskExecutorFactory` supports the method \"createTaskManger\" to bring up `TaskManger` for outside  world, and this method will construct the related components(`TaskManagerConfiguration`, `NetworkEnvironment`, `IOManager`, `MemoryManager`)\n5. For testing mode, construct the `TestingTaskExecutorFactory` to pass all the components explicitly, including (`ResourceID`,`MemoryManager`,`IOManager`,`NetworkEnvironment`,numberOfSlots, `RpcService`,`HighAvailabilityServices`), the `TaskManagerConfiguration` should be passed from outside or generate implicitly?\n6. In addition, the localTaskManagerCommunication parameter is needed before to decide whether to create `NettyConfig` for standalone or yarn mode. Now I will remove this parameter to create `NettyConfig` always.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/244666006/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/244688376","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2294#issuecomment-244688376","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2294","id":244688376,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NDY4ODM3Ng==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-05T08:28:53Z","updated_at":"2016-09-05T08:28:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sorry for the late reply @greghogan.\n+1 from me as well.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/244688376/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/244690650","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2461#issuecomment-244690650","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2461","id":244690650,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NDY5MDY1MA==","user":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-05T08:39:22Z","updated_at":"2016-09-05T08:39:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @wangzhijiang999, maybe we should start simple without introducing a factory method, because there might actually be not many cases to distinguish. Maybe we could rename the `TaskManagerFactory` into `TaskManagerRunner` which has static methods to create the `TaskManagers` components and does the network selection. That way we keep the initialization and the actual `TaskManager` logic separated.\n\nFor testing purposes I guess we don't need to setup any components because they are usually mocked or one is using testing components. Passing these components to the constructor of the `TaskManager` should not be a big deal.\n\nDoes this make sense?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/244690650/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/244697602","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2456#issuecomment-244697602","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2456","id":244697602,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NDY5NzYwMg==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-05T09:10:31Z","updated_at":"2016-09-05T09:10:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think this is good.\nFew comments inline on the names, the hardest problem usually ;-)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/244697602/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/244699680","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2450#issuecomment-244699680","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2450","id":244699680,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NDY5OTY4MA==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-05T09:20:23Z","updated_at":"2016-09-05T09:20:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Quick question: The `ForkableFlinkMiniCluster` was something semi-public, in the sense that it was part of the `flink-test-utils` project and used by quite a few users.

I changed the pr based on your advice, including ：\n1. Modify UnmatchedLeaderSessionIDException to LeaderSessionIDException, format code style and method comment, and add checkNotNull to constructor\n2. Format code style and method comment of ResourceManager\n3. Group the TaskExecutorGateway and the InstanceID into a TaskExecutorRegistration\n4. Modify testcases which are expected to throw exception at ResourceManagerTest\n\nBesides, I don't understand this comment of yours: \"Should we fail or decline the registration here? So either sending an exception or a RegistrationResponse.Decline message.\".
