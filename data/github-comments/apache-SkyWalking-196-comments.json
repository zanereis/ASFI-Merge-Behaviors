we had a lot of problems recently with huge queues and delays (separate issue discussed in builds@apache.org) but one of the problems we've hit was that the canceling was not \"aggresive\" enough for duplicates in case there were many builds queued.\r\n\r\nThe most recent release of my action solves that problem I believe. I not only improved/cleaned/documented the code, but I also implemented \"allDuplicates\" cancel mode, that works in the way that single pass of even hours long \"workflow_run\" action, cancels all duplicates - no matter if they are \"older\" than the run or \"more recent\". The action always leaves only the most recent run from each \"branch\" (no matter what branch it is) and cancels all other. I would love to hear if that helps in your case.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/720002268/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/720002462","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/5556#issuecomment-720002462","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/5556","id":720002462,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyMDAwMjQ2Mg==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-31T23:40:49Z","updated_at":"2020-10-31T23:40:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"More

If you have time and interest to follow this, I want to provide a more complex brief on what is the better way.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, #5754 should be accepted, as it is a minor change and has low risk but fixed the issue quickly.\r\nThen, after the deep discussion with PingCap, I think we could do\r\n1. Create several physical tables for one logical entity in the OAP\r\n1. Set a view to represent the logical entity.\r\n1. Make the metrics data rolling with a certain order, such as `(time bucket - 19700101) mod size`.\r\n1. TTL timer chooses the oldest physical table and does `truncate`(according to PingCAP, `truncate = drop + create table`)\r\n\r\nCould you run a POC locally, especially on\r\n1. `CREATE VIEW v1 AS SELECT * FROM t1, t2, t3`, table t1, t2, t3 include time bucket and entity id.\r\n1. Run `group by` to get `top N` and `avg` from the view.\r\nIn theory, TiDB should support that, but we should check it before really change many things.\r\n\r\nFYI @moonsphere This will be a big improvement, also, it will take time.

Because you add `@Trace`, so maybe that is your own code issue, which is putting the root span in the wrong place.\r\nIn the Kafka consumer side, there would be no root span, unless you set one like `@Trace`.\r\nAlso, you need to find, whether the multiple messages really carry the same context. \r\nAbove are my best guesses.\r\n\r\nBasically, if you changed the codes, and are using the codes in some scenarios we don't know, I recommend we work on some high-level discussion, rather than codes and UI.

线程数是700，消费者和生产者得到的日志也是700行，且消息对象中的`targetId`并没有重复，这说明消息并没有重复；\r\n- 通过`TraceContext.putCorrelation();`方法传递的`swTraceId`,`uuid`也是重复的；\r\n- 在生产者日志中，`swTraceId`与`traceId`是一致的，但是到消费者中却不一致了。\r\n\r\n**也就是说，kafka传递的消息体正常，但是Trace上下文全乱了，包括自定义的Correlation。**\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI modified the code and did a test and came to the following conclusion:\r\n\r\n- The number of threads is 700, the logs obtained by consumers and producers are also 700 lines, and the `targetId` in the message object is not repeated, which means that the message is not repeated;The number of threads is 700, the logs obtained by consumers and producers are also 700 lines, and the `targetId` in the message object is not repeated, which means that the message is not repeated;\r\n\r\n- The `swTraceId` and `uuid` passed by the `TraceContext.putCorrelation();` method are also repeated;\r\n\r\n- In the producer log, `swTraceId` and `traceId` are the same, but in the consumer they are not consistent.\r\n\r\n**In other words, the message body passed by Kafka is normal, but the Trace context is completely messed up, including the custom Correlation.**","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/721086384/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/721090168","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/5781#issuecomment-721090168","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/5781","id":721090168,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyMTA5MDE2OA==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-03T12:36:04Z","updated_at":"2020-11-03T12:36:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"First, if the trace context in the header of Kafka's message is correct, then this is not a bug of SkyWalking and its plugin.\r\nThe issue you are facing because of your `@trace` and your codes. \r\n\r\n---\r\nIn the SkyWalking, if a segment(consumer in your case) has multiple parents(we call it `reference`), then only the first trace-id left to propagate. Because this is better for performance. If you are using the batch consuming mode, then this is expected, not a bug. If you are not expecting the batch consumption, then it means you put `@trace` at the wrong place.\r\n---\r\n\r\nI hope the above explanation is clear enough for you.
