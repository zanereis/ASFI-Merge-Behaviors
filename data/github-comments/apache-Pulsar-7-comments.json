complications to implement it and not sure if it's worth to introduce it to solve a problem which may touch very small no of clients for now.\r\n- to prevent same unsupported-consumer connect again: need to store unsupported-consumerId set at topic level (because once consumer is disconnected, it will try to create new connection on topic)\r\n- now, we can have unique consumer-id at connection
