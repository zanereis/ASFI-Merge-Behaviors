Could that be achieved differently by making the Jena OWL 2 support a new Jena module that pulls in the dependency on ONT-API (explicitly excluding its own Jena dependency) so you'd get all the supporting code you need from there without duplication?

There are some process steps necessary; the code, apart from license headers and Eclipse issues noted below, looks good.\r\n\r\n**1. Licenses**\r\n\r\nAll the java files and the POM file need the Apache license header for contributed code. The text is not the same as a 3rd party use of the Apache license.\r\n\r\nThe attached bash script [`fixlicense`](https://github.com/apache/jena/files/15143404/fixlicense.txt) (instructions in the file) will fixup the java. (`.txt` added to make it accepted to GH upload). The POM file needs the same comment at the top as `jena-arq/pom.xml`.\r\n\r\nIt's important that these are done before the code is added to the Jena codebase. The project can't make changes in order to accept a contribution.\r\n\r\n**2. build**\r\n\r\nAt the top level,\r\n\r\n```\r\n    mvn clean install\r\n```\r\n\r\nshould run. After fixing the license issues above, and after rebasing to current main, it does for me.\r\n\r\n**3. Code (compile)**\r\n\r\nWhile it builds using maven, but fails in Eclipse IDE. It looks like the eclipse compiler does not handle generics in the same way as OpenJDK. The attached file [pr2420-eclipse.txt](https://github.com/apache/jena/files/15143468/pr2420-eclipse.txt) contains a diff for building in Eclipse and with maven. (Diff relative to code before headers changed.)\r\n\r\n**4. Javadoc**\r\n\r\nThere are javadoc warnings. Some relate to IntelliJ as they look like specific items but are quite a few incorrect javadoc.\r\n\r\nUnder Eclipse: 293 javadoc errors.\r\n\r\nWith maven: 45 javadoc errors including about `@inheritDoc` and `com.github.sszuev.jena.ontapi.vocabulary`.\r\n\r\nWhen working with the whole codebase, for example, during a release, it's very useful to have as clean a build as practical so it is easy to see new warnings appearing.\r\n\r\n**5. ICLA** (Individual Contributors License Agreement)\r\n\r\nThis is a significant contribution. we need an ICLA on-file.\r\n\r\nThe form and instructions are available at\r\n\r\nhttps://www.apache.org/licenses/contributor-agreements.html#clas\r\n\r\nhttps://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf\r\n\r\nHaving read the [intellectual property clearance process](https://incubator.apache.org/ip-clearance/index.html) and looked at the list of previous contributions in the Foundation, I don't now think we need a Software Grant. We would if there was an owning organsiation involved, but as @ssvuev would be signing both, nothing is gained.\r\n\r\nTaking into account the code origin discussion here on the PR, please remove the mention \"The original code\" sentence in README.md. If you want to credit the inspiration or ideas, please feel free to.\r\n\r\n**6. Prepare for merge**\r\n\r\nIt would be useful if you could rebase the PR to current `main`.\r\n\r\nFor incorporating into the Jena codebase, we don't need all the development commits.\r\n\r\nMy preference is that the PR in squashed to a single commit, with mesage like \"GH-2160: ...\".  I didn't see any groups of related commits that would be useful to keep together. It's better to do the suqash on the PR, not via github \"squash and merge\" so that it is merged into Jena exactly as contributed.\r\n\r\n**7. PMC VOTE**\r\n\r\nWhen it's ready, we'll have a formal VOTE on dev@jena to show the PMC is aware and agrees to what is going on.\r\n\r\n**8. Documentation - jena-site**\r\n\r\nAt some point, not necessarily before merging the code, the Jena website will need at least one page describing the new ontapi.  If nothing else, something the release can point to and about how user can migratre code to using the new module. How much of the existing documentation still applies (except for the java package name).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/2081626363/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/2082479566","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/2420#issuecomment-2082479566","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/2420","id":2082479566,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec58IB3O","user":{"login":"sszuev","id":17473366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDczMzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17473366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sszuev","html_url":"https://github.com/sszuev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sszuev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sszuev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sszuev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sszuev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sszuev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sszuev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sszuev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sszuev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sszuev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-29T11:31:43Z","updated_at":"2024-04-29T11:31:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> At the top level, `mvn clean install` should run.
