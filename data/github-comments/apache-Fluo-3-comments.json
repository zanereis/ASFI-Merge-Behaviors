Switching from Set to Iterable is what made me decide against this.\n\nHonestly, I haven't really looked at the API's close enough to make the judgement call. I just saw the subject and wanted to mention it.\n\nMy opinions on it are based on the following. For method arguments, typically the method doesn't actually care what the data structure implementation is. If you're just treating it as a stream of entries/records coming in, you don't need to impose anything special like a list or a set. If your method needs or benefits from having some certain data structure, then that's a good reason to use a Set or List specifically.\n\nFor returning Iterables, it's the same premise in reverse. If you consider what a caller might be doing with the result from your method, you want to be as specific as possible. If you only return Iterable, the caller will have to manipulate that data structure to get to some List, Set, or otherwise. It can also introduce some confusion because users don't really know what the method is returning to them (is it a big data structure, is it expensive to make, etc). Returning as specific of a type from a method as possible is a good idea as the caller can always downcast it to something more generic that fits their circumstances.\n\nTake it with a grain of salt. This is my current opinion :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/56063222/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/56071770","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fluo/issues/152#issuecomment-56071770","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/152","id":56071770,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MDcxNzcw","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-09-18T17:15:44Z","updated_at":"2014-09-18T17:15:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @joshelser, makes perfect sense.   \n\nThe reason I wanted to stick w/ Set in the API for columns is that we really don't expect a user to pass a List with the same column repeated 20 times.

Should we force exclusive creation of the table?\n\n2) It's possible there's a table in the cluster with the same name as the proposed Fluo table in the config but not intended for the same purpose.

This would allow them to act but doesn't stand in the way.\n\nIn a 1.0.0, I'd like to give the user an option: \"A table with the specified name already exists, would you like to [d]rop, [r]ename, or [a]bort?\"\n\nI'm also pondering whether or not we should use namespaces for our tables so that we can, at the very least, guarantee the intention was to drop a Fluo table.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/56128120/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/56128295","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fluo/issues/14#issuecomment-56128295","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/14","id":56128295,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MTI4Mjk1","user":{"login":"cjnolet","id":1242464,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDI0NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1242464?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet","html_url":"https://github.com/cjnolet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-09-19T02:21:48Z","updated_at":"2014-09-19T02:21:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The more I think about it- it would be better to fail because we need to make certain guarantees about the table (like no versioning iterator) without changing the configurations of the table and confusing the user.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/56128295/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/56178357","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fluo/pull/197#issuecomment-56178357","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/197","id":56178357,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MTc4MzU3","user":{"login":"mikewalch","id":730698,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMDY5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/730698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch","html_url":"https://github.com/mikewalch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-09-19T13:43:37Z","updated_at":"2014-09-19T13:44:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"After reading through @cjnolet's comments in #14, I think the best solution is to remove the `io.fluo.admin.zookeeper.clear` property and prompt the user when the `initialize.sh` script is run.  It could go something like below: \n- User runs configures fluo.properties and runs `./initialize.sh``\n- Initialization first checks if instance exists.  If it does, prompts user with:\n\n```\nA Fluo instance exists in zookeeper at /fluo. Do you want re-initialize?  Y / N\n```\n\nIf No chosen, abort.  Next, if table chosen by user in fluo.properties exists, prompt user with:\n\n```\nAn Accumulo table called 'mytable' already exists.  Do you want to drop and recreate this table?  Y / N\n(If No chosen, pick a new table name in fluo.properties and re-run intialize.sh). \n```\n\nFinally, initialize Zookeeper and create table after getting through above.\n\nThere could also be an `initalize.sh --force` that answers yes to both questions above for scripts.\n\nIn FluoAdmin, initalize() could be modified to the following:\n\n``` java\ninitialize(boolean clearZk, boolean clearTable) throws AlreadyInitalizedException, TableExistsException\n```\n\n@cjnolet, while I think this would be great to have for alpha, an issue could be created and this could be done in Beta. If this is pushed to Beta, I think an intermediate solution is to check if the table exists before any zookeeper initialization and print a message (rather than throwing an exception) telling the user that they need to drop the accumulo table before initializing this instance.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/56178357/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/56179526","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fluo/pull/197#issuecomment-56179526","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/197","id":56179526,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MTc5NTI2","user":{"login":"cjnolet","id":1242464,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDI0NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1242464?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet","html_url":"https://github.com/cjnolet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-09-19T13:52:33Z","updated_at":"2014-09-19T13:52:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@mikewalch, Your solution is right along the lines of what I was thinking in the ticket. I think that'd be great for a beta instance. I was also thinking about it more last night after my comments- the clearZookeepers() would be misleading if we were expecting that to act upon the table as well so I agree that should either be removed or renamed. IMO, it could probably be removed in light of better user-interaction in the script itself (see Accumulo's Initialize class).\n\nIn the meantime, I do agree that a better message should be printed before the clearing of zookeeper if the table already exists. I'm thinking maybe we could change \"clearZookeeper()\" to \"allowReinitialize()\" (something that would let a user know they'd be starting from scratch.) \n\nI'm okay with this simply because I'm seeing the alpha release more as an opportunity for users to play with and begin to build Fluo into the designs for their own applications. As a result, I think we can get away with changing the property and the underlying logic in beta.\n\nWhat do you think?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/56179526/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/56180967","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fluo/pull/197#issuecomment-56180967","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/197","id":56180967,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MTgwOTY3","user":{"login":"cjnolet","id":1242464,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDI0NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1242464?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet","html_url":"https://github.com/cjnolet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-09-19T14:03:20Z","updated_at":"2014-09-19T14:03:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Created

M/R has no mechanism for the input format to clean up after the entire job is completed.  The solution for this issue should avoid an issue like [ACCUMULO-829](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ACCUMULO-826), where killing the process that started the M/R job borks the entire job.   \n\nThats why I think #33 may be a good solution.  A user could do something like the following.\n1. create named snapshot\n2. run job against named snapshot\n3. delete named snapshot  \n\nIt should be easy for a user to do the above steps in a single process, but we should not require that it be done in a single process.   I think #33 will be fairly easy to implement now that #8 is done.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/56442405/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/56446944","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fluo/pull/165#issuecomment-56446944","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/165","id":56446944,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NDQ2OTQ0","user":{"login":"cjnolet","id":1242464,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDI0NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1242464?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet","html_url":"https://github.com/cjnolet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-09-22T21:35:03Z","updated_at":"2014-09-22T21:35:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hey

If we don't do something, then the burden will be placed on every user to find a solution.  Maybe named snapshots could optionally be created w/ a TTL?  The users tool could do the following.\n\n``` java\n   //not sure about the API or where it would live, in API.. just picked fluoClient \n   //maybe should be admin?\n   NamedSnapshotOptions nso = new NamedSnapshotOptions();\n   nso.generateUniqueName(); //or could give it a name\n   nso.setTTL(1, TimeUnit.DAYS);\n   String namedSnap = fluoClient.createNamedSnap(nso);\n\n   // configure
