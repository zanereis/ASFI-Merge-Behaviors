That is why the user does not decide, dispatcher does. I must say out of all libraries, I find yours as the best - but it was not available when we started this conversation. Also I have issues with it which I can discuss here or in your repo if needed. But just as an example, there seems to be two concepts for dispatcher (dispatcher and sender which amounts to considerable part of the code) which I find unnecessary and confusing. A  common dispatcher can do some in memory buffering and then you will have transport specific implementations.\r\n\r\n>  creating a N-th library from existing libraries looks like a good idea but I have the feeling that I will personally not use since we have a working one\r\n\r\nIf *everyone* feels there is no need for another library, that too could in the end be the solution and the fruit of this conversation.

This mixed state is mitigated by the setting\r\n    `STRICT_TRACE_ID=false`, explained below. Once a migration is complete,\r\n    remove the setting `STRICT_TRACE_ID=false` or set it to true.\r\n\r\n    Supporting changes are:\r\n\r\n    `SpanStore.getTrace(long traceIdHigh, long traceIdLow)`\r\n    `StorageComponent.Builder.strictTraceId(boolean strictTraceId)`\r\n\r\ncommit 27686c6ec9bed77e254c2b0d527db25897d0e205\r\nAuthor: Adrian Cole <adriancole@users.noreply.github.com>\r\nDate:   Sun Jul 31 10:39:30 2016 -0700\r\n\r\n    Updates versions, most notably spring boot 1.4 (#1211)\r\n\r\ncommit 0635ffbc848e7ed351055205f21918d7e3bcf860\r\nAuthor: Adrian Cole <acole@pivotal.io>\r\nDate:   Fri May 13 09:27:13 2016 +0800\r\n\r\n    Files storage components under zipkin.storage package\r\n\r\n    This moves storage components under the zipkin.storage package.\r\n\r\n    By doing so, we clear the main `zipkin` package for classes used by all\r\n    code, including instrumentation.

I'm adding some notes to help frame thing, and thankful for the help.\r\n\r\nThe current topic is custom auth (also how any instrumentation might produce it). This will be easier for something like sleuth (as it uses the same language and library), so particularly important to consider non-jvm instrumentation, too.\r\n\r\nTo frame things, I think the idea is to understand what's sustainable and sensible to support wrt auth either directly (some auth module that covers all http), or indirectly (swap out http ui or collector for something secured). This is important as folks have different security contexts (some api key, some basic auth, some oauth). Also, afiak, the only http span reporters that support auth only do so because their underlying libraries do.\r\n\r\nTo set this up for success, I'm pinging some folks who have custom http collectors for insight on what auth means for them (wrt at least collector, but perhaps ui if willing to share)\r\n\r\n@trustin and @anuraaga (armeria collector)\r\n@marcingrzejszczak (some folks do [custom auth](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-sleuth/pull/316) in sleuth, presumably via custom servers?)\r\n@kevinmdavis @denyska (stackdriver zipkin)\r\n@nicmunroe riposte\r\n@pavolloffay hawkular\r\n\r\nthen other folks who have requested auth, but not on this thread, yet (at least @jquatier)\r\n\r\nOne thing of note is that while you can add transports to the zipkin-server (like sqs, etc), you currently cannot modify the http configuration. I think this is an artificial constraint, which we can likely change. For example, zipkin-ui autoconfiguration exists independently, so it should be possible to change UI authorization without affecting the http transport. However, it should also be possible to change the http transport for reasons including auth (ex performance which I know others have done in the past).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/286020709/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/286021264","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1462#issuecomment-286021264","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1462","id":286021264,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NjAyMTI2NA==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-13T05:54:08Z","updated_at":"2017-03-13T05:54:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"ps not merging https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/1538#discussion_r105528463 until someone weighs in on whether we should use QUERY_LOOKBACK, or introduce ES_NAMES_LOOKBACK instead.

After that, it's just up to the data model to store this restriction some way - a somewhat complicated way that doesn't require changing the model would probably be some binary annotation like ```secure_annotations = \"adriancole;key1,key2,key3\"``` (not really binary at this point...). The collector would validate this annotation against the provided identity (SSL certificate). The web UI could then trust this annotation to authorize when returning spans.\r\n\r\nAuthenticating and authorizing requests to a web UI tends to be more complicated - if I was a Google Apps user I would expect authenticating to be Google Login Oauth and authorizing a lookup of Google groups. Other organizations might have different methods for employee authentication like LDAP. \r\n\r\nI guess the three components needed would be \r\n1) What are the authorized parts of a span (specific annotations, entire span, etc)\r\n2) Given a span-writing request, what's it's identity (pluggable, default could be SSL certs)\r\n3) Given a request to the web ui, what identities can it access
