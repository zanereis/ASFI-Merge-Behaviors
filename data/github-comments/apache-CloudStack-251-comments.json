However, this does not happen with novnc based console which fails to get/load the websocket URL (upgrade url fails) if the console for the same VM was previously opened with older vnc (tile-based, the `/ajax` path) provider.\r\n\r\nThe other issue I'm seeing is when I copy and use the console url and append `websocketconsole=true`, it does open `/novnc/` path in the iframe however, it's bit flaky. For example, if I open the window more than once, the older session/tab/popup should be invalidated without which sometimes what happens is console does open but is not responsive to inputs (keyboard strokes). I've tested this so far only on KVM, I'm planning to do the same for VMware and XenServer next week. /cc @syed \r\n\r\nRebasing notes: I've rebased and fixed conflicts on your branch against latest master, if you wish to work on it please do a git pull --rebase `<remote> <branch>` against your local branch.
