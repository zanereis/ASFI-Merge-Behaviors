There is no need to pass txId to server/to client. JDBC client can only use one transaction per session, so map of transactions redundant too, one reference to current transaction is enough. Old activeTx flag can be reused again, instead of deprecation to inform client about started transaction.\r\n2. In the current implementation 3 request is required to perform query with auto commit (instead of 1 query in the previous implementation). We can reduce requests count. We already pass \"autoCommit\" flag with the message, so at least we can commit transaction on server side without additional endTxRequest. Also we can start transaction without startTxRequest for queryes with autoCommit, but in this case we should know tx parameters (for example pass it with handshake message and store in client context on server side)\r\n3. Enabling TX_AWARE_QUERIES on server side will automatically break queries on atomic caches. So, I think, default isolation level should be TRANSACTION_NONE. For transactional caches with the new option you still need to add `commit`, so code for transactional caches will be rewritten in any case, so user also can add required isolation level too. But for atomic caches - it's working code, with no problems in current implementation, and it's not good to force user to rewrite working code. Also, problems with atomic caches will fire at new, unpredictional places, whenever problems with transactions are already known to user and it's better to rewrite code at known places.
