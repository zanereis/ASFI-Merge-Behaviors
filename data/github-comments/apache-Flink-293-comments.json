Concerning your points:\r\n\r\n- I would like to not move the user code class loader generation into the factory because it's the `JobManagerRunner's` task to manage the lifecycle of the user code class loader. This would need to be duplicated for every `JobMasterServiceFactory` implementation. Moreover, in the future I would like to change the `JobManagerRunner` so that it only creates a `JobMasterRunner` if it has gained the leadership.\r\n- I guess the `JobMaster` construction process could be stream lined as well. However, I would see this as an orthogonal topic which could be done as a follow up.\r\n- The `JobMasterServiceFactory` will be used in #7565 for testing the `JobManagerRunner`. That's also the reason why I introduced it.\r\n- Not sure whether I got your last point. Could you try to rephrase it? Do you mean the `JobMasterServiceFactory` can be subsumed by the `JobManagerRunnerFactory`? Or do you mean the opposite (getting rid of `JobManagerRunnerFactory`)? I think at the moment we also use the `JobManagerRunnerFactory` abstraction in some tests. Therefore I'm not 100% sure whether this is possible.\r\n- Parameterizing the `DefaultJobManagerRunnerFactory` with the `JobMasterServiceFactory` can be done when the need for it is there.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/458167703/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/458168312","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/7563#issuecomment-458168312","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/7563","id":458168312,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1ODE2ODMxMg==","user":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-28T15:09:48Z","updated_at":"2019-01-28T15:09:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the review @azagrebin.

I have also implemented the test for the `FlinkKafkaProducer011` across different version of flink (1.7). So the result are the same for both `FlinkKakfaProducer` and `FlinkKafkaProducer011`. For both of them I'm trying 3 different tests:\r\n\r\n1. ` testRestoreKafkaTempDirectory` check if we can recover the committed transaction --> OK\r\n2. `testRestorePendingTransaction`check if we can recover the pending transaction --> ERROR no pending transaction ( Not sure if this behaviour abnormal or just that we can't recover the pending transaction after a versioning )\r\n3. `testRestoreProducer` check if we can produce committed transaction and pending transaction after the versioning --> OK\r\n\r\nI have started to work on the last test FlinkKafkaProducer011 --> FlinkKafkaProducer : \r\nBut I'm quickly stuck with an exception when initializing the testHarness ( created with FlinkKafkaProducer ) with the savepoint of FlinkKakfaProducer011. Is this action feasible with the testHarness API or there is a turn around to this issue ?\r\n\r\nRefactoring should also be considered.

changes in your branch looks good 👍 \r\nThe tests you added also verifies that the changes fixes the following 3 scenarios (if I understood correctly):\r\n- Partition discoverer is always closed when open method throws exception\r\n- Partition discoverer is always closed if fetcher throws exception (either creation of the fetcher, or the fetch loop)\r\n- Partition  discoverer is always closed on normal termination\r\n\r\nI've added some additional changes here: https://github.com/tillrohrmann/flink/pull/8\r\nThe changes refactors the new tests a bit to have consistent life cycle verifications.\r\nAlso, it adds some test coverage that the discoverer is waked up before being closed in the scenario that the discoverer will be concurrently accessed (i.e., after the discovery loop has started).\r\n\r\nAll in all, this LGTM on my

I think there might be couple of issues:\r\n1. You call snapshot with the same ID twice\r\n```\r\n\t\ttestHarness.snapshot(1L, 3L);\r\n\r\n\t\tOperatorSubtaskState snapshot = testHarness.snapshot(1L, 3L);\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. all 3 of your tests seem to run against the same Kafka brokers, ZooKeeper instances. You shouldn't be recovering to the same savepoint twice, without reseting external state in Kafka brokers and ZooKeeper. Otherwise second (and subsequent) recoveries will be working against Kafka/ZooKeeper state as it was left by the first recovery (pending transactions committed/aborted etc).\r\n\r\n3. Kafka has a transaction timeout for pending transactions, after which the transactions are being aborted. If the time between writing down the Kafka/ZooKeeper state and restoring from it is greater then the said timeout, probably transactions will be aborted. I'm afraid that this might prove impossible to test migration with pending transactions from previous Flink versions :/ The only thing that we could test is to write down the Kafka/ZooKeeper state with pending transactions with current code version, restart Kafka (possibly with newer version) and try to recover from savepoint...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/458530867/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/458541155","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2671#issuecomment-458541155","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2671","id":458541155,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1ODU0MTE1NQ==","user":{"login":"mxm","id":837221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNzIyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/837221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm","html_url":"https://github.com/mxm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-29T13:34:21Z","updated_at":"2019-01-29T13:34:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"We should fix this.

Is this action feasible with the testHarness API or there is a turn around to this issue ?\r\n\r\nI don't know. I'm not aware of any test that attempts to do that, so maybe this is a missing feature and maybe you are right that it has to be fixed somehow for the test.\r\n\r\nI have also thought more about the issue with timeouts on pending transactions. This means that the only way to test for 1.7 -> 1.8 migration with pending transactions, would be some awful code that downloads the Flink 1.7 sources/binaries and creates a savepoint during the test execution. I think that would be extremely difficult to do so we can ignore this issue for now... That would leave us with the following tests that theoretically we could implement:\r\n1. migration of `FlinkKafkaProducer` from pre-made 1.7 savepoint to master without pending transactions\r\n2. migration of `FlinkKafkaProducer011` from pre-made 1.7 savepoint to master without pending transactions\r\n3. migration from  `FlinkKafkaProducer011` master savepoint to `FlinkKafkaProducer` master without pending transactions\r\n4. (optional) migration from  `FlinkKafkaProducer011` pre-made 1.7 savepoint to `FlinkKafkaProducer` master without pending transactions\r\n5. (optional) migration `FlinkKafkaProducer011` -> `FlinkKafkaProducer` from savepoint created on demand (during unit test) from master to master versions, with pending transactions \r\n6. (optional) upgrading Kafka brokers when using `FlinkKafkaProducer` from savepoint created on demand (during unit test) from master to master versions, with pending transactions\r\n\r\n1, 2 and 3 are IMO must have. There is a chance that Flink 1.8 will support \"[stop with savepoint](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-11458)\" feature, which would mean that there would be no pending transactions in savepoints. With that guarantee, 1, 2 and 3 would essentially cover all of the required upgrade paths. Story of upgrading from 1.7 `FlinkKafkaProducer011` to 1.8 `FlinkKafkaProducer` would be covered first by step 1, then by step 3. \r\n3, 4 and 5. have the issue that you reported that probably test harness needs to be adjusted\r\n6. will have yet another issue of handling two different.\r\n4, 5 and 6. would be nice to have, but as long as \"[stop with savepoint](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-11458)\" is there, they are not strictly required.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/458609356/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/458650005","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/7020#issuecomment-458650005","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/7020","id":458650005,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1ODY1MDAwNQ==","user":{"login":"stevenzwu","id":1545663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDU2NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1545663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu","html_url":"https://github.com/stevenzwu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-29T18:21:24Z","updated_at":"2019-01-29T18:21:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@tzulitai

Or it might win solely on the basis of being closer to production readiness.\r\n\r\nI suggest to just close both of these PRs for now, and then maybe later get back to these performance issues with a fresh mind.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/458913525/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/458919118","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/7579#issuecomment-458919118","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/7579","id":458919118,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1ODkxOTExOA==","user":{"login":"kisimple","id":2209870,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDk4NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2209870?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kisimple","html_url":"https://github.com/kisimple","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kisimple/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kisimple/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kisimple/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kisimple/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kisimple/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kisimple/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kisimple/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kisimple/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kisimple/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-30T12:00:12Z","updated_at":"2019-01-30T12:00:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"cc @pnowojski ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/458919118/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/458935243","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3511#issuecomment-458935243","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3511","id":458935243,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1ODkzNTI0Mw==","user":{"login":"twalthr","id":5746567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDY1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5746567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr","html_url":"https://github.com/twalthr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-30T13:01:21Z","updated_at":"2019-01-30T13:01:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @ggevay, thanks for letting us know the current status of both PRs.
