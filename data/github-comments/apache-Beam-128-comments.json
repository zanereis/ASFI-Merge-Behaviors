fact, I believe you prior change that removed PCollection references from `SideInput` makes this change mandatory:\r\n\r\n - Previously, the local names could be different and the validation condition was that the PCollection refs in side inputs were a subset of the PCollection refs in the generic graph inputs.\r\n - Now, that cannot be validated. This change makes it much more clear that a subset check on the keys is the new validation condition.\r\n\r\nI think the new world after your two PRs is better, more constrained in a good way. I'm not bothered by a PCollection appearing multiple times as a generic graph node input.\r\n\r\nCaveat: What I _do_ care about is that it is easy for an SDK to implement positional access to side inputs but I think they could do this by embedding generated tags in the serialized UDF.\r\n\r\nWe will find out more when we start replacing existing bits with `ParDo` payloads. So LGTM, but I think we should pause the micro edits until we are using the API in Java, then
