Today at 10:00, skywalking is built in a completely new environment; ES7 is also new. It has no data at all. After that, it will collect more than one hour's data and view the service topology map. If the time node is selected as the latest day, the effect of the topology map is correct. However, if the latest week is selected, there are some services in the topology map that do not have a connection at all, which actually shows a connection. I'm surprised that since it's the new one installed today, shouldn't the topology map display the same in the last day and the last
