I haven't had a chance to completely review/test this yet. One thing that I think we need to address, though, is something that I just noticed the other day with the 'retry' fields that were recently added. I had to make a small update: https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5809/files#diff-fcc9a36983c80e3ddfb13c77ac2db46d83346e6f55f84f44cedfc7a33bf43e02R67-R177\r\n\r\nThe issue here was related to the fact that we add a new field to a component. So in this case, zIndex is added to label. If you've pushed your flow to Registry using 1.15.3 or earlier, and now you startup with this version, we end up seeing a \"Local Change\" to each of those labels. And you can't revert the change. As a result, you won't be able to change to a later version. So we need to make a similar update here: If there's a flow difference that changes the zIndex from `null` to the default value (`0`), then we need to return `true` from that `isEnvironmentalChange` method. Granted, `isEnvironmentalChange` is probably no longer the most accurate name for that method, but basically is used to filter out any flow change that we don't want to consider a \"Local Modification\".","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1054582005/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1054587923","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5814#issuecomment-1054587923","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5814","id":1054587923,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM4-27wT","user":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-28T19:26:07Z","updated_at":"2022-02-28T19:26:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"THanks @exceptionfactory looks good to me. +1 will merge.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1054587923/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1054590253","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5805#issuecomment-1054590253","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5805","id":1054590253,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM4-28Ut","user":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-28T19:29:24Z","updated_at":"2022-02-28T19:29:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @exceptionfactory !

Including the Process ID looks like a useful runtime adjustment, regardless of system integration tests. Those changes could be reviewed and incorporated separately from the integration test improvements.\r\n\r\nThanks @exceptionfactory for the feedback.  Looking at this PR as a whole, I agree that it should be broken out, and I'm in the process of doing that.  I'll close this PR in favor of those.\r\n\r\n> The runtime change to `LoadBalanceSession` also seems worth considering separately, but in that case, I'm not sure that hard-coding a one second read timeout makes sense in all cases.\r\n\r\nYep.  The one second timeout only affects the server ACK part of LoadBalance protocol.  I tried it out in response to direct evidence of an issue with that part of the protocol, and things ran much better on the github CI machines.  But I agree it looks icky.  Something is going on there that needs further investigation.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1057507510/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1057528047","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5787#issuecomment-1057528047","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5787","id":1057528047,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM4_CJjv","user":{"login":"greyp9","id":14890693,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODkwNjkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14890693?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/greyp9","html_url":"https://github.com/greyp9","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greyp9/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greyp9/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greyp9/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greyp9/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greyp9/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greyp9/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greyp9/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greyp9/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greyp9/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-03T00:12:32Z","updated_at":"2022-03-03T00:12:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing

There is a notable amount of code specific to MongoDB, which looks like it could be refactored to leverage the existing `MongoDBControllerService`.  In light of existing components capable of interacting with MongoDB, it seems like it would be better to implement a more focused processor to handle NGSI event conversion, as one possible approach.\r\n\r\nAs a potential way forward, it would be helpful to write up a basic design in the associated Jira issue and solicit feedback using the mailing lists.

First thing to know is that the UI uses the SlickGrid library to render the tables, which has two behaviors of note:\r\n- when a component designed to filter selectable results from a table is rendered, the first row is marked as \"active\"\r\n- when a row is marked as \"active\", SlickGrid will mark that row's cells as \"selected\"\r\n\r\nThe next thing to know is that most of the elements in the UI are rendered with absolute positioning, which causes some headaches when making display changes to lists of elements. For example, when trying to get the top border to display for the first row in the table, modifying the _row's_ margin-top offset instead of the padding of the _cells_ causes SlickGrid's \"getCellFromPoint()\"'s offset math to not be able to find the cells it is attempting to apply the \"selected\" class to.\r\nThe borders are applied to the cells for these reasons, which means the padding-top needs to account for the borders to keep the contents of the cells from visually moving.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1065557556/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1065616373","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5840#issuecomment-1065616373","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5840","id":1065616373,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM4_hAP1","user":{"login":"MikeThomsen","id":108184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODE4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeThomsen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-11T22:57:17Z","updated_at":"2022-03-11T22:57:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@andrewmlim since joe is canceling the release vote, can we close this out?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1065616373/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1066174058","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5830#issuecomment-1066174058","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5830","id":1066174058,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM4_jIZq","user":{"login":"MikeThomsen","id":108184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODE4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeThomsen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-13T20:15:10Z","updated_at":"2022-03-13T20:15:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mattyb149 I think we're going to have to do that for now.
