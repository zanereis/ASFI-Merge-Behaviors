discussion with @cbickel, I added following changes.\r\n\r\n* Add test case to check whether volume mapping is rotted or not\r\n* Synchronize configuration files when deploying\r\n* Change `default_security` to `admin_only`\r\n* Add volume mapping for configuration directory by default.\r\n* Configure serial value as 1.\r\n\r\nLogics behind these changes are as follow:\r\n\r\n### 1. Test scenario.\r\n\r\nIn the future, if configuration directory in `apache/couchdb` is changed, our configuration files will be mapped to wrong place. Since there will be already configuration files in the container by default, CouchDB will run without any problems though our configuration files will be located in different place.\r\n\r\nUnder this situation, `ConfigurationTests` will check if `default_security` is `admin_only`.\r\nSince default value in `apache/couchdb` is `admin_local`, test will be failed, and we can get it volume mapping is rotted.\r\n\r\n### 2. Set `serial` value as 1.\r\n\r\nMain purpose of this pr is to make CouchDB restartable.\r\nSince CouchDB cluster should be kept during restarting of individual node, it would be better to deploy CouchDB node one by one.\r\n\r\n\r\n### 3. Synchronization of configuration files.\r\n\r\nAs volume mapping for configuration is enabled by default just like nginx, we need to synchronize configuration files from `src` directory at every redeployment. So when we change CouchDB configuration and redeploy it, we should delete existing directory first and copy all files from `src`.\r\nThis is because `apache/couchdb` change the ownership of configuration files to `uid: 1000` when begins. So I changed `copy` task to `synchronize` task to make these two steps into one.\r\n\r\nNow configuration files will be synchronized to `dest` directory and if there are already existing files which is not in `src` directory, they will be deleted.\r\nIn this way, we can only concern `src` directory all the time.\r\n\r\nIf you need to change CouchDB configuration, you can just change it in `src` directory and just redeploy it. It will make sure both directory is same and there will be no any residue in `dest` directory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/357417153/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/357430994","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/3106#issuecomment-357430994","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/3106","id":357430994,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NzQzMDk5NA==","user":{"login":"style95","id":3447251,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDcyNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3447251?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95","html_url":"https://github.com/style95","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-13T12:22:21Z","updated_at":"2018-01-13T12:22:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"It

Following rough patch demonstrates and fixes that.\r\n\r\nThe issue appears to during materializing of the source in call to `collectLogs` ->  -> `DockerToActivationFileLogStore#collectLogs` -> `logs.runWith`. Here when the Source is materialized it results in an exception which is not wrapped in Future so current failure handling gets tripped\r\n\r\n```patch\r\nIndex: core/invoker/src/main/scala/whisk/core/containerpool/ContainerProxy.scala\r\nIDEA additional info:\r\nSubsystem: com.intellij.openapi.diff.impl.patch.CharsetEP\r\n<+>UTF-8\r\n===================================================================\r\n--- core/invoker/src/main/scala/whisk/core/containerpool/ContainerProxy.scala\t(revision 925500cf8d34bb75bebd077ea057af236eba0b01)\r\n+++ core/invoker/src/main/scala/whisk/core/containerpool/ContainerProxy.scala\t(date 1516298930000)\r\n@@ -38,6 +38,8 @@\r\n import whisk.core.entity.ExecManifest.ImageName\r\n import whisk.http.Messages\r\n \r\n+import scala.util.Try\r\n+\r\n // States\r\n sealed trait ContainerState\r\n case object Uninitialized extends ContainerState\r\n@@ -380,18 +382,25 @@\r\n     val activationWithLogs: Future[Either[ActivationLogReadingError, WhiskActivation]] = activation\r\n       .flatMap { activation =>\r\n         val start = tid.started(this, LoggingMarkers.INVOKER_COLLECT_LOGS)\r\n-        collectLogs(tid, job.msg.user, activation, container, job.action)\r\n-          .andThen {\r\n-            case Success(_) => tid.finished(this, start)\r\n-            case Failure(t) => tid.failed(this, start, s\"reading logs failed: $t\")\r\n-          }\r\n-          .map(logs => Right(activation.withLogs(logs)))\r\n-          .recover {\r\n-            case LogCollectingException(logs) =>\r\n-              Left(ActivationLogReadingError(activation.withLogs(logs)))\r\n-            case _ =>\r\n-              Left(ActivationLogReadingError(activation.withLogs(ActivationLogs(Vector(Messages.logFailure)))))\r\n-          }\r\n+        Try(\r\n+          collectLogs(tid, job.msg.user, activation, container, job.action)\r\n+            .andThen {\r\n+              case Success(_) => tid.finished(this, start)\r\n+              case Failure(t) => tid.failed(this, start, s\"reading logs failed: $t\")\r\n+            }\r\n+            .map(logs => Right(activation.withLogs(logs)))\r\n+            .recover {\r\n+              case LogCollectingException(logs) =>\r\n+                Left(ActivationLogReadingError(activation.withLogs(logs)))\r\n+              case _ =>\r\n+                Left(ActivationLogReadingError(activation.withLogs(ActivationLogs(Vector(Messages.logFailure)))))\r\n+            }) match {\r\n+          case Success(e) => e\r\n+          case Failure(t) =>\r\n+            tid.failed(this, start, s\"reading logs failed: $t\")\r\n+            Future.successful(\r\n+              Left(ActivationLogReadingError(activation.withLogs(ActivationLogs(Vector(Messages.logFailure))))))\r\n+        }\r\n       }\r\n \r\n     // Storing the record.
