You had an interesting idea about some xml file where this may be all set up.  Like a context dependency injection type of thing like Spring. They have something like that for the Android OS but I couldn't find a java example for Linux.  I think what I checked in won't produce any runtime errors.  I did test it with Fluo-uno on my system which is running Centos-7.  We are onto a solution here but I think something more customized to our LRU caching is in order.

I was mainly just wondering if VFS already supported config-only setup of this stuff, so we can just use it.\r\n\r\nLong-term, I'd like to strip VFS out of Accumulo, and instead provide a simple entry point for user-specified (admin-specified) classloader for our existing named context classloaders. I don't think Accumulo should be in the business of maintaining custom classloaders for users inside the project... but should instead empower users to provide their own classloader from outside the project, if they so desire. Then, if they wish to use one that is based on VFS, they are free to do so, but it is their responsibility to initialize it and pass it to Accumulo.\r\n\r\nBut, that's a long-term vision, and we'd need to get there incrementally. One step could be: do less VFS setup in code, if VFS is already configurable outside of code.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/474582763/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/474586788","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/1034#issuecomment-474586788","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1034","id":474586788,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NDU4Njc4OA==","user":{"login":"jzgithub1","id":5930146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MzAxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5930146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1","html_url":"https://github.com/jzgithub1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-19T21:13:18Z","updated_at":"2019-03-19T21:13:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I will keep looking around.

Which is a simplification of what @andrewglowacki suggested earlier and I misread, I was thinking of wait time ratios and not server ratios.    Instead of a user configuring two things (an expected server and a ratio) just configure one, the min servers which is the product of the two.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/475750687/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/475875787","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1049#issuecomment-475875787","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1049","id":475875787,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NTg3NTc4Nw==","user":{"login":"EdColeman","id":7047700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDc3MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7047700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman","html_url":"https://github.com/EdColeman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-23T14:47:43Z","updated_at":"2019-03-23T14:47:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"How would a property account for situations when something other that the default table balancer is used?\r\n\r\nIn practice, I'll use pssh to start the tservers first, and once they are up and stable I'll start the master.

I have not found that use case in my search of the Accumulo code but the possibility of someone doing that can't be ignored.  If I revert the modifications I made on the ArrayByteSequence, ByteSequence,  and MutableByteSequence then will the modifications to the Key class be helpful.  I can see in the RFileClientTest that recomputing of hashcodes will be prevented with the changes I made to the Key class.  MemKey extends from Key so the speed gain in key search can be gained in MemKey lookups.  This is a small issue and I know we are trying to get a release out, so I don't want to take up too much of anybody's cycles on this.   I have sped up some comparison code in the past doing something like this so I am just trying to do the same thing here.

Because of 2, we'd want to upgrade to ensure users aren't set up for failure, because of being forced to use an older, buggy version, because of possible incompatibilities with a newer versions. Because of 3, we have to be careful not to set users up for failure by shipping a known buggy version in our own binary assembly that they're likely to use.\r\n\r\nAll that said, I do not care if we revert #659 or apply the cast workaround to bind to the correct method. Both solutions seem to work fine.
