Jackson 2 compatibility has remained solid for a number of releases, so moving to a common version seems like a good solution. As an adjustment to the approach, it seems like it would be better to use the `jackson-bom` dependency to ensure that all related Jackson 2 libraries have the same version. That also streamlines the dependency declarations in the root Maven configuration.\r\n\r\nAs part of this change, it also looks like the `jackson.version` property could be removed from a number of modules.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1078522568/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1078895279","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5898#issuecomment-1078895279","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5898","id":1078895279,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5ATqKv","user":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-25T10:46:40Z","updated_at":"2022-03-25T10:46:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1

It looks like the most recent commits removed the original changes from HashMap to LinkedHashMap. If you can update the PR to include both your original changes, as well as the test changes that seem necessary to make everything work as expected, that would be helpful. Having everything together would also help clarify how individual tests may or may not need to be changed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1083136599/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1083144804","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5915#issuecomment-1083144804","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5915","id":1083144804,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5Aj3pk","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-30T13:31:22Z","updated_at":"2022-03-30T13:31:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the contribution @hboutemy!

Yes, the implicit schema handling remains the same. The `createRecordSchema` method evaluates fields from all configured Grok Expressions\r\n2. Implementing a Controller Service for sharing Grok Expression resources could be useful, particularly when paired with custom Grok Patterns. There is an open issue to make the custom patterns more configurable as well. This particular set of changes is more of an incremental improvement, so a well-designed Controller Service seems like a potential follow on approach\r\n3. The challenge of tracking the matching pattern is that different records could match different patterns. Perhaps this could be achieve through an additional record field, but it may not be necessary in all cases. Perhaps this could also be an additional feature?\r\n\r\nIn the process of evaluating this change, there are some opportunities for additional improvements, although it seems better to focus those in separate tasks.
