if you search by service name and then you try to edit the box and remove all the content (quick way to clear the service name you entered) the \"servicename\" option is not present any more in

text box with servicename=? i think this is the same issue jorgheymans noted\r\n\r\nI see! I understand!\r\n\r\n> does it make sense to not have the user click on the + on load and open up with the the first search box ready to be filled.\r\ni believe this is an issue even in existing UI but when you start typing the service name the characters dont show up right away until the lookahead is returned making it feel like a hang at times. since we are in the same code base would be great if we can fix it?\r\n\r\nI see...\r\nYou mean the searchbar does not have to be shown until serviceNames has been loaded, right?\r\nIt's OK to me.\r\nBut the same problem occurs with `spanNames` and `remoteServiceNames`.\r\nThe list of spanName and remoteServiceName candidates are loaded after the serviceName associated with them has been determined.\r\nSo there is always a waiting time for the list of spanName and remoteServiceName to load when we input criteria to searchbar.\r\nSo for now, I'm not going to handle that issue in this PR.\r\nWe can change it

can see the need for an easy way to jump to a span if the trace is very large or contains many similar looking spans (e.g. batch process messaging), but adding them visually into the UI is just not nice aesthetically. \r\n\r\nThere might be a path towards this though. If we consider span being a 'subresource' of a trace, then URL wise it would need to show up as an [URI fragment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_fragment). If Lens were to support such fragments e.g. `http://localhost:9411/zipkin/traces/f2882c7bde1c028e#92168a494b0c68318`, we could load the trace detail screen with a specific span highlighted. UI wise, people could then just develop a bookmarklet that prompts for the span id and adds it to the URI. This would be beneficial for Lens in general (ability to 'deep link' into a span), and you could piggy back it for your search needs.

While I think it will be a half feature\nak think it is better than adding the span ID for EVERY span in the trace.\nI am also concerned about edge cases, for example what happens if you\nchanged the local root and the span is not anymore in the screen? In that\nsense I think the anchor approach is still good as it can point you\ndirectly to that span by changing the local root.\n\ntir. 11. aug. 2020, 06:50 skrev Jason Bulicek <notifications@github.com>:\n\n> @bulicekj <https://github.com/bulicekj> lazy github search.. does\n> haystack-ui have a jump to span ID thing of any kind in trace view, or\n> another way to get to a specific span?\n>\n> We do not.

In this particular case, a limited-size queue is used to buffer some data while we have a small bottleneck we're working with.  Some simple retries with an appropriate backoff policy could address the same basic problem of slow storage but may be harder to tame with respect to pending actions.  Meaning, I can't say how hard it is to prevent an \"infinite queue\" with the retry handlers.\r\n\r\nFWIW, the ExecutorService that backs this implementation is pretty universal and supported by Java.  The only part that is not is the one that adjusts how many threads are allowed to be active in it.

The current result table has _filtering feature_.\r\n> Is this necessary?\r\n\r\nDoes this only allow filtering by service name? Is there a way to search for traces containing two or more different services? Maybe it is used for that, but if the search can do that maybe it isn't needed.\r\n\r\nUnrelated and not critical to address in this pull request as I assume it is existing behavior, but what is the sorting of the service names? It made me wonder if it isn't more helpful to sort them by the highest number of spans if there isn't other meaning to the current order.\r\n\r\nSomeone who uses Zipkin on a regular basis should probably chime in on whether the service names being visible or not (without mousing over) affects their usual workflow (e.g. ctrl+F search in page for service... though I guess this is what the filter mentioned above is for).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/678016446/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/678050542","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/3178#issuecomment-678050542","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3178","id":678050542,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3ODA1MDU0Mg==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-21T05:41:45Z","updated_at":"2020-08-21T05:41:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks
