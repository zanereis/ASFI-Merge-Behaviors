@wolfstudy @sijie \r\n\r\nI'm new to this community, but would like to start contributing.\r\nI had a look at the reader code and the type assertion seems incorrect here and must be tested to avoid the panic.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pulsar-client-go/pulsar/c_reader.go#L118\r\n\r\nValue of options.StartMessageID which is of Go Type [MessageID](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pulsar-client-go/pulsar/message.go#L81), will fail to be used as type *[messageID](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pulsar-client-go/pulsar/c_message.go#L39) if the value passed to it is created by anything other than these 2 available defaults https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/35bb23520ca0518764952d0a780a50861ee5a0d7/pulsar-client-go/pulsar/message.go#L93\r\n\r\nThe fix in my opinion would be to test the type assertion, and if it fails, recreate a messageID using its serialized data using this https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/35bb23520ca0518764952d0a780a50861ee5a0d7/pulsar-client-go/pulsar/message.go#L87\r\nThis will ensure
