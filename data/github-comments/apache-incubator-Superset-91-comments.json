it helps, I have dockerised this so it should hopefully be straightforward to reproduce.\r\n\r\n- The Oracle docker image was taken out of the box from \"wnameless/oracle-xe-11g\"\r\n- The Superset docker image has been customised from \"amancevice/superset\" to include the oracle drivers.\r\n\r\nAlso - I can confirm that this is all hanging together and that when I use the standard SQL Lite database for the superset db, the db upgrade works and I can log in as admin and add the Oracle database as a data source and query it successfully.\r\n\r\nFinally, it is worth mentioning that I am running my Docker instance on Windows.\r\n\r\nThe setup is as follows:\r\n\r\n## ./Dockerfile.superset:\r\n```\r\nFROM amancevice/superset\r\n\r\nUSER root\r\nRUN pip install cx_Oracle --upgrade\r\nRUN apt-get install libaio1\r\nCOPY instantclient_11_2 /lib/oracle_instantclient_11_2\r\nENV LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\"/lib/oracle_instantclient_11_2:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}\"\r\n\r\nUSER superset\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Important:** Before you build that image, you need to download the Oracle instant client (11G version) from the Oracle website.

approach that might be relevant for writing custom connectors is https://github.com/yhat/pandasql.\r\n\r\nThat project allows you to use SQLite-compatible SQL to query a Pandas Dataframe. It does it (AFAIK) by automatically serializing the dataframe to a temporary SQLite DB and then executing the query against it and reading back the result.\r\n\r\nIn theory, that would allow us to create a new connector that inherited from `SqlaTable` and forced the database dialect to SQLite and then the existing `query()` method could be reused entirely. I don't know how functional it would be, but in theory if it serializes to a SQLite table and then executes the query using the real engine, then any valid SQLite query should work.\r\n\r\nI am not planning on using that approach myself, because I think that the overhead of serializing and then deserializing the rows will be too much, but it does solve some of the other problems, and so I am mentioning it here in case it is relevant for anyone else.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/329776023/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/329778941","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/3447#issuecomment-329778941","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/3447","id":329778941,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyOTc3ODk0MQ==","user":{"login":"zerodf","id":12236106,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjM2MTA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12236106?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zerodf","html_url":"https://github.com/zerodf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zerodf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zerodf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zerodf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zerodf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zerodf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zerodf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zerodf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zerodf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zerodf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-15T13:13:36Z","updated_at":"2017-09-15T13:13:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@mistercrunch, \r\n\r\nNo problem.

this by design (this is not addressing or working around a bug in Druid). If you specify a threshold of 5 for a TopN query, Druid will always return the top 5 results per granularity (lets ignore that its not guaranteed they are the actual top 5 but likely the top 5). \r\nAs an example of the default TopN behavior, lets say you want to query the top 5 Campaigns with the most (ordered by) \"Ad-Impression\" on a daily level over a week. Druid will return the top 5 campaigns for Monday, the top 5 for Tuesday, etc... If everyday you have a different set of 5 campaigns you will end up with 7x5 = 35 different Campaigns in your result set, each one with exactly one datapoint. (This is what you can see in the first screenshot)\r\n\r\nThe argument for this changeset is, that the behavior described is not actually useful and counter intuitive when you want a line-chart for the top 5 Campaigns. What you expect is to see the change over time for the same top 5 Campaigns day by day over the course of the week.  \r\nThe way this is implemented is running one TopN query with granularity ``all`` over the entire time range to find the top 5 campaigns and then run a TopN query with granularity of ``1 day`` filtered to the campaigns of the first run.\r\n\r\nWe have been running this code for about 3 weeks and have not run into problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/329899241/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/329906212","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/3464#issuecomment-329906212","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/3464","id":329906212,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyOTkwNjIxMg==","user":{"login":"jgbolger","id":10573913,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTczOTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10573913?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgbolger","html_url":"https://github.com/jgbolger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgbolger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgbolger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgbolger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgbolger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgbolger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgbolger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgbolger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgbolger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgbolger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-15T21:18:11Z","updated_at":"2017-09-15T21:18:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I'm not sure Oracle can be used without code changes - I think you need to tell SQLAlchemy to use sequences for id generation, otherwise it expects there to be auto increment behaviour.
