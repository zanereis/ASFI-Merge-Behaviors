It is specifically used for loadable functions. Maybe it is better to rename it to `MySQLCreateLoadableFunctionStatement`.\r\n\r\nAccording to the document, the loadable function is defined as follows:\r\n\r\n> A loadable function is a way to extend MySQL with a new function that works like a native (built-in) MySQL function such as ABS() or CONCAT()\r\n\r\nBecause of the loaded shared library file, loadable functions can be used globally, while user-defined functions can only be used in the corresponding db range.\r\n\r\nDue to these different characteristics, the loadable function is divided into DALStatement, and the user-defined function is divided into DDLStatement, which also leads to the statement is not convenient to reuse, because we will use different routing engines according to the statement type.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/842864015/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/842876348","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/10375#issuecomment-842876348","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/10375","id":842876348,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0Mjg3NjM0OA==","user":{"login":"gloriawish","id":7948408,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDg0MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7948408?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gloriawish","html_url":"https://github.com/gloriawish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gloriawish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gloriawish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gloriawish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gloriawish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gloriawish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gloriawish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gloriawish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gloriawish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gloriawish/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-18T06:13:22Z","updated_at":"2021-05-18T06:13:22Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"please assgin to me","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/842876348/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/842876535","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/10353#issuecomment-842876535","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/10353","id":842876535,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0Mjg3NjUzNQ==","user":{"login":"SteNicholas","id":10048174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDQ4MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10048174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteNicholas","html_url":"https://github.com/SteNicholas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteNicholas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteNicholas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteNicholas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteNicholas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteNicholas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteNicholas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteNicholas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteNicholas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteNicholas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-18T06:13:42Z","updated_at":"2021-05-18T06:13:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> @heysJava Hi, I have checked the Connection implementation of MySQL JDBC driver.

I'm a student from [Summer 2021](https://summer.iscas.ac.cn/#/org/orgdetail/apacheshardingsphere). I would like to do this project as the Summer 2021 Project. \r\n\r\nFor automatically publish docs to shardingsphere-doc repository when released, I have a workflow which helps me automaticly sync repos from GitHub to Gitee: https://github.com/HollowMan6/LZU-Auto-COVID-Health-Report/blob/main/.github/workflows/repo-sync.yml , the mechanism behind this is such code: https://github.com/wearerequired/git-mirror-action/blob/master/git-mirror.sh . So I think such a logic can be used for realizing this feature, too. Just generate those docs then auto push commits to shardingsphere-doc repository.\r\n\r\nFor automating the issue standard handling process, I guess a workflow may not be the best way? Why not try some bots in GitHub Apps for this, such as https://github.com/marketplace/issue-label-bot . If such kind of bot can't be found, I can also help to make one. I'm the author of the LZU COVID Health Report: https://github.com/marketplace/lzu-covid-health-report , which now ranks first in GitHub MarketPlace Trending.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43995067/118655695-5f283e00-b81c-11eb-83a5-47a5bed73be5.png)\r\n\r\nFor automatically publish image to docker registry when released, I actually have a project that has realized this feature to push image to docker hub and also GitHub Container Registry with multiple architecture support realized by docker buildx: every time when I push a new commit, the workflow will automatically push the image with tag `latest`, and when I release a version, the released version's image will be automatically pushed to the registry tagged correctly. The workflow also supports a manual dispatch specifying the tag.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43995067/118653706-62bac580-b81a-11eb-9392-7dff707484ac.png)\r\n\r\nHere's the link of my workflow file for automatically publish image to docker registry : https://github.com/HollowMan6/LZU-Auto-COVID-Health-Report/blob/main/.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml\r\n\r\nPlease tell me if I got something wrong or there's a better idea.
