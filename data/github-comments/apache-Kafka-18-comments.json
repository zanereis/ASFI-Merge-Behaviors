That means I have to explicitly call the default partitioning logic for all topics except those that my Producer forwards. Of course, with multiple sinks in my topology, I have to put all of the partitioning logic inside a single class.\n\nThis change would make it a _lot_ easier to specify custom partitioning logic for individual output topics. Firstly, each sink represents a single output topic, so the logic of the partitioner is simpler and _only_ has to deal with the one topic. Secondly, the partitioner accepts the same key and value types as output by the processor, again making the logic simpler. Thirdly, the partitioner interface is a functional interface, simplifying what Java 8 users have to do to define the logic. Finally, this also keeps the logic of choosing partitioning strategies where it belongs, as part of building the topology.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/148125949/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/148140877","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/299#issuecomment-148140877","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/299","id":148140877,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0ODE0MDg3Nw==","user":{"login":"SinghAsDev","id":4915557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MTU1NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4915557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghAsDev","html_url":"https://github.com/SinghAsDev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghAsDev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghAsDev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghAsDev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghAsDev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghAsDev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghAsDev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghAsDev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghAsDev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghAsDev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-14T18:10:32Z","updated_at":"2015-10-14T18:10:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@datalorax list does not use consumer to get list of consumer groups, it instead gets consumer groups from ZK.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/148140877/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/148147797","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/299#issuecomment-148147797","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/299","id":148147797,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0ODE0Nzc5Nw==","user":{"login":"gwenshap","id":1189030,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODkwMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1189030?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap","html_url":"https://github.com/gwenshap","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-14T18:33:52Z","updated_at":"2015-10-14T18:33:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@SinghAsDev since the new consumer does not register consumer groups in ZK, does it mean the feature will no longer work?

If not, then we may want to change SSLFactory to provide a helpful message, in that case (assuming it's not hard to do).\n\nAlso, looking at the SSLFactory code, I am not sure `checkKeyStoreConfigs` is actually useful. Also, we don't have an equivalent `checkTruststoreConfigs`. Maybe worth checking that code and simplifying it at the same time.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/148310677/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/148312107","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/312#issuecomment-148312107","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/312","id":148312107,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0ODMxMjEwNw==","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-15T08:04:08Z","updated_at":"2015-10-15T08:04:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Also, if you're willing, I noticed that the following are unused in `SSLConfigs`:\n\nSSL_NEED_CLIENT_AUTH_DOC\nDEFAULT_SSL_NEED_CLIENT_AUTH\n\nIt would be good to remove them.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/148312107/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/148312616","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/312#issuecomment-148312616","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/312","id":148312616,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0ODMxMjYxNg==","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-15T08:07:13Z","updated_at":"2015-10-15T08:07:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Sorry, I noticed one more thing.

I will remove SSL_NEED_CLIENT_AUTH properties in SSLConfig and fix the exception messages.\n\nThe checks in `checkKeyStoreConfigs` dont do anything useful because the keys are always present even the value is null. Since null checks are performed in `createKeystore` anyway, I will remove `checkKeyStoreConfigs`. \n\nJava uses `$JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts` as default keystore and truststore if the stores are not explicitly configured and no system properties are specified. We would like to use the default truststore part of this so that our customer's clients dont have to set a truststore at all. \n\nThe default keystore is of less value. Even before this PR, the code was falling back to default keystore for clients since keystore is optional unless server has client-auth turned on. So on the client side, the code is fine as is. \n\nOn the server side, we do always need a valid keystore. If one is not specified and the default is used, handshake would fail unless the default cacerts contains a valid keypair or the javax.net.ssl.keyStore property is set. And the user would need to debug the problem in the same way as mismatched client/server certificates. I dont think we should any additional checks of cacerts file itself other than what Java does anyway. The question is whether we should always mandate that keystore is explicitly specified in Kafka configs for Kafka server when SSL is enabled. Or should we simply fall back to the JVM system defaults? What do you think?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/148344473/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/148347221","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/312#issuecomment-148347221","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/312","id":148347221,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0ODM0NzIyMQ==","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-15T10:38:24Z","updated_at":"2015-10-15T10:38:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I agree with your assessment @rajinisivaram.\n\nRegarding the server side keystore, I can see pros and cons for each option.
