In the ListenHTTP case, Jetty has some SSL protocols and ciphers disabled by default that may be available to the JVM. There are two reasons i wouldn't want to tweak ListenHTTP to allow any configured protocol. \r\n\r\n1. It changes the processor behavior since those Jetty-disabled protocols wouldn't have worked previously anyway.\r\n2.

And I absolutely love that you saw something that can be improved and jumped in to improve the user experience! However, I am a bit concerned with the approach taken here because while it does scratch an itch, it does so only for CSV data and as a result isn't really consistent.\r\n\r\nI would like to start a discussion on how we could perhaps handle this in a more generic way. My first thought is to actually provide an alternative implementation of the Schema Registry. Call it ExplicitStringFieldSchemaRegistry for lack of a better name (i'm suggesting calling it this for the sake of the discussion, not necessarily creating an implementation with this name). The idea here, though, is that there would be a new implementation of SchemaRegistry. In this new implementation you would add properties just like AvroSchemaRegistry. The name of the property would be the name of a schema. But the value, instead of an Avro Schema, would be a comma-separated list of column names, and all would be assumed to be Strings. This approach gives us a few different benefits.\r\n\r\nFirst, it allows this same approach to be taken with other data formats (flat JSON, for example). Also, it keeps things consistent in terms of how we access the schema (we can still use the Schema Name property along with the Schema Registry). It also makes the CSV Reader more re-usable because we can use Expression Language to access the name of the schema, so a single CSV Reader can be used by many different processors spread throughout the flow.\r\n\r\nWhat I would love to see at some point is a more powerful SchemaRegistry service that provides a Custom/Advanced UI for actually building schemas. I think this would be extremely powerful and useful and far easier to use. But I promise that I am the last person that you (or any user) wants building a UI :)\r\n\r\nAny thoughts here?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/315072484/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/315098678","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1973#issuecomment-315098678","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1973","id":315098678,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNTA5ODY3OA==","user":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-13T14:42:37Z","updated_at":"2017-07-13T14:42:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@m-hogue Thank you for the review and feedback! this LGTM to me too, ran tests with various number of missing columns.

Good points. I actually considered adding a schema registry at first, but thought it might be too much for just making CSV in/out easier.\r\n\r\nI think using schemas falls into two categories. Case A schemas are ones that someone uses all the time. Having a schema registry is great then, because it's consistently defined in a single place. Case B schemas are one-off scheams. Input or output is in some format a person doesn't typically use, and someone is just converting to-or-from a Case A often-used schema. In this case, the \"Schema Text\" property becomes really useful. Rather than cluttering your registry, you can just define the Case B one-off in a processor/service, and never think about it again.\r\n\r\nTo your point, I've only solved Case B, for CSV in/out. By adding a \"ExplicitFieldSchemaRegistry\" or \"ColumnSchemaRegistry\" (I think whatever this gets named, it's going to be ugly =P) we can tackle Case A for any type (parsing CSV, JSON, Avro etc).\r\n\r\nI think to do this completely properly, we should solve this for Case A and B, for any type.\r\n\r\nSo I personally think we should add a new schema registry for Case A, but I think we could also add some \"Schema Format\" property (defaulting to Avro) to `SchemaRegistryService` that informs Record Services how to interpret \"Schema Text\". That way, it's also easy to define Case B one-off schemas of any type.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I spell good.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/315126433/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/315195665","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2004#issuecomment-315195665","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2004","id":315195665,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNTE5NTY2NQ==","user":{"login":"trkurc","id":3050642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTA2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3050642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trkurc","html_url":"https://github.com/trkurc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trkurc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trkurc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trkurc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trkurc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trkurc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trkurc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trkurc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trkurc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trkurc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-13T20:40:42Z","updated_at":"2017-07-13T20:40:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"started reviewing this one","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/315195665/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/315196064","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1986#issuecomment-315196064","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1986","id":315196064,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNTE5NjA2NA==","user":{"login":"trkurc","id":3050642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTA2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3050642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trkurc","html_url":"https://github.com/trkurc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trkurc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trkurc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trkurc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trkurc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trkurc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trkurc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trkurc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trkurc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trkurc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-13T20:42:25Z","updated_at":"2017-07-13T20:42:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@m-hogue - where would the exception occur?

This moves away from the ConvertXToY type processors in favor of providing custom record reader and recordset writer controller service implementations which can be leveraged and re-used by LookupRecord, ConvertRecord, PartitionRecord, QueryRecord, MergeRecord, UpdateRecord, etc. There is already a JsonTreeReader, JsonPathReader, and JsonRecordSetWriter available, so if you were to provide an OrcReader and OrcRecordSetWriter, you would be able to perform bidirectional conversion of JSON to/from Orc, along with Grok, CSV, Avro, freeform text, and scripted implementations.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, I believe the community would be better served by creating a `XmlRecordReader` and `XmlRecordSetWriter` controller services which can be leveraged by the entire \"record\" ecosystem of processors. \r\n\r\nWe (the community) should go through outstanding/open tickets that reference specific `ConvertXToY` activities and update them so people do not spend unnecessary energy on the old paradigm.
