However, In that case test \"must be\" optional because  it wouldn't succeed on travis builds that Druid has, instead, people changing relevant  code  hopefully would  run that test manually when submitting the PR.\r\n\r\nHowever there is the second wrinkle. Writing that test would still take me some time to figure out client side okta things that human user does, such as typing  a username/password on okta display page. At this point I am not sure if openID is only meant for human interaction or if there is a programatic way also because I have only seen this particular auth flow used in a human interaction case, probably there is spec for programmatic access too but I am not familiar/aware of it right now and would need to do some research on that.\r\n\r\nwith that in mind, would you be ok if such test is done in a separate PR without blocking this?

thoughts as I've been reviewing this (sorry I haven't finished yet): \r\n\r\nDo you view this as an interim configuration, to allow your work to proceed on an alternative discovery mechanism, until we can decouple zookeeper specific code from all of the places that need to check this setting? or is the plan to leave it like this? So far I find it kind of ugly to have a setting like this due to all of the if/else branches it causes, but maybe there is some obvious reason I haven't got to yet on why we aren't adding some sort of `druid.discovery.type=zk|none` instead of this enable/disable setting. I know some of the current HTTP modes are sort of leaky in terms of still doing zk stuff to support rolling update situations to transition settings, i would be in favor of breaking the current versions that support that, and adding some sort of composite or special mode to run both versions just for transition scenarios if that is the main driver to have the setting be this way.\r\n\r\nI'll keep reviewing, and try to finish up later tonight.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/603005260/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/603022685","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/9543#issuecomment-603022685","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/9543","id":603022685,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwMzAyMjY4NQ==","user":{"login":"sydt2014","id":7714512,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MTQ1MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7714512?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sydt2014","html_url":"https://github.com/sydt2014","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sydt2014/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sydt2014/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sydt2014/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sydt2014/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sydt2014/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sydt2014/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sydt2014/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sydt2014/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sydt2014/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-24T05:22:25Z","updated_at":"2021-09-23T15:10:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This may a bug for druid-kerbeos!!!

Would you tell me more about this?

My original intention was to add a low-level framework for aggregator testing without using the query framework (because it's high-level!), but I admit they are kind of similar. Let me check if they can be merged.

For example ensuring the intermediate sketch data representations are handled properly in various combinations.

It would be nice if  tests like `DoubleMeanAggregationTest` could use the  generic data  generation  framework than to create their own limited dummy data sets and that would enable covering even more code paths.\r\n\r\nFurther low level UTs are nice to have to flush out other corners that above high level  tests can't exercise.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/604735785/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/604736409","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/7511#issuecomment-604736409","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7511","id":604736409,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwNDczNjQwOQ==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-26T23:21:41Z","updated_at":"2020-03-26T23:21:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue has been marked as stale due to 280 days of inactivity.
