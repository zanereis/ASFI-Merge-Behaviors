Thanks!\n\n@jwang98052 note that we have changed the behavior of an `Exception` occurring in `TaskCloseHandler`. This may change the behavior in fault tolerance, when you are forcing Tasks to close. I've modified the tests to fit the behavior, but there might be things I'm missing. Please take a closer look.

My concern is that the `IMRUDriver` doesn't seem to loose complexity as part of the move to the various `Manager` classes. In fact, it seems to be gaining complexity and state.\n\nI was hoping for a significant reduction in complexity when we do things via Rx operators. For instance, we could have something like this:\n\n```\nclass ContextManager: Observer<ActiveContext>, Observer<FailedContext>, Observable<IEnumerable<ActiveContext>>\n{\n}\n```\n\nThis class receives all events as they pertain to contexts and emits the `IEnumerable<ActiveContext>` whenever it has received enough `ActiveContext` events. Similarly, it could have access to a `IMRUStateManager` which keeps tabs on the overall state of the system. If an event violates the state machine assumption, `ContextManager` would call `OnError` for its subscribers.\n\nSimilar approaches can the thought of for `EvaluatorManager`, `TaskManager`, ...\n\nMaybe I am being naive, but this approach should encapsulate the mutable state (and therefore complexity) of IMRUDriver into smaller units, which makes it much easier to test and debug. Right now, I fear we use the various `*Manager` classes as collection objects only, which keeps all of the logic in the Driver.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/228151272/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/228240411","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/1051#issuecomment-228240411","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/1051","id":228240411,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyODI0MDQxMQ==","user":{"login":"dkm2110","id":151031,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/151031?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkm2110","html_url":"https://github.com/dkm2110","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkm2110/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkm2110/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkm2110/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkm2110/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkm2110/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkm2110/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkm2110/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkm2110/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkm2110/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-24T02:20:15Z","updated_at":"2016-06-24T02:20:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@afchung left one comment.

Basically EvaluatorManager is also the AllocatedEvaluatorHandler and FailedEvaluatorHandler, TaskManager is also RuningTaskHandler and  FailedTaskHandler and responsible for submit tasks, etc. \n\nThe pros are, driver is simple, and the managers can be reused in other fault tolerant if they are abstracted good enough. \n\nThe cons are all those managers need to know each other. For example, in FailedEvaluatorHandler, EvaluatorManager needs to talk to TaskManager for the failed task wrapped in the FailedEvaluator. With the current approach, driver knows every one and control the system state. All the managers are responsible for managing their own entities, they don't talk to each other and they also don't know the system state. \n\nI guess one way to avoid the cross references is for them to observe each other as you suggested. Like TaskManager observes Context manager, TaskManager also needs to observe EvaluatorManager so that FailedEvaluator onNext will trigger a call in the TaskManager to record FailedTask wrapped inside Failedevaluator,etc. \n\nFor the lock, should all the managers (event handlers) share the same lock? Currently, all the managers are marked as NotThreadSafe and driver has one lock for all the handlers. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/228439116/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/228474734","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/1042#issuecomment-228474734","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/1042","id":228474734,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyODQ3NDczNA==","user":{"login":"jwang98052","id":5666504,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NjY1MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5666504?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052","html_url":"https://github.com/jwang98052","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-24T22:10:50Z","updated_at":"2016-06-24T22:10:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@markusweimer After REEF-1466 is resolved, we should be fine with this change.
