the more I thought about it, the more I like the idea of using hooks. I've been working to transform the code.\n\nHowever, I'm running into major issues with the current GoogleCloudStorageHook. The biggest is an `oauth2client` version conflict that makes it impossible to use `gcloud` (see below) but a few smaller ones are that there's no way to get a Python blob object and I don't know how to do something simple like upload a string to GCS without writing a file first. Worse, every time I try to use it I get an error about empty scopes not being allowed... so the truth is I haven't even been able to do much testing since I actually can't get started.\n\nYou're right that the GoogleCloudStorageHook uses Google's Python API client, but that's different from the Google Cloud Platform Python client, which is `gcloud` (https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/gcloud-python/). From the docs:\n\n> What is the relationship between gcloud and the Google APIs Python Client?\n> \n> The Google APIs Python Client is a client library for using the broad set of Google APIs. gcloud is built specifically for the Google Cloud Platform and is the recommended way to integrate Google Cloud APIs into your Python applications. If your application requires both Google Cloud Platform and other Google APIs, the 2 libraries may be used by your application.\n\nUnfortunately, in this case it is _not_ possible to use both libraries together because the GoogleCloudStorageHook added `oauth2client<2.0.0` to the airflow requirements (I assume because 2.0.0 introduced some breaking changes to the API client, namely https://github.com/google/oauth2client/issues/401). But the latest `gcloud` requires `oauth2client >= 2.0`. As a result, ironically, I suspect that any airflow users who use `gcloud` are finding that their code is broken after installing airflow master! Even myself, I didn't realize this was the problem until I went digging just now -- we just knew we had to reinstall gcloud after installing airflow, but couldn't figure out why.\n\nI am working on a new PR to create a GCSHook that wraps `gcloud`. At a minimum, I think we need to move the oauth2client requirement into a \"gcs_api\" extra and out of airflow's default requirements. I will do that in another PR, in case the first PR is held up for any reason. I will design this to work alongside the existing GCP hooks, since I don't want to break anything. I know that your organization must depend heavily on GCP and I _strongly_ recommend that you consider adopting `gcloud` over the API client, if possible. It has bindings for bigquery and datastore. \n\nAgain, I totally appreciate that you guys probably have lots of code in production using the legacy client, but we want to make sure folks can also use `gcloud` without problems :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/192461854/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/192463703","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/1111#issuecomment-192463703","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1111","id":192463703,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MjQ2MzcwMw==","user":{"login":"toryhaavik","id":4268290,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNjgyOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4268290?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/toryhaavik","html_url":"https://github.com/toryhaavik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toryhaavik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toryhaavik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toryhaavik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toryhaavik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toryhaavik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toryhaavik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toryhaavik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toryhaavik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toryhaavik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-04T20:53:17Z","updated_at":"2016-03-04T20:53:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This is probably a dumb question, but I have little experience with SQLAlchemy.

I did see one pool is full with those running tasks so no other tasks can proceed\n3. the LocalTaskJob process is usually very lightweight so there's little chance it will be killed, but the spawned process sometimes may do a heavy job like using lots of memory. In such case, they are easily being killed by some external daemon monitoring process because of out of memeory, too much FD,etc. Like in some cases, all the process is running in a docker, so a docker daemon will kill those spawned process.  \n\nThanks again for the quick reply\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/192705846/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/192712923","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1126#issuecomment-192712923","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1126","id":192712923,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MjcxMjkyMw==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-05T19:25:50Z","updated_at":"2016-03-05T19:25:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@artwr , looks like @bolkedebruin beat you to it :), would you mind testing it in our infra and giving the thumbs up?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/192712923/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/192713106","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1126#issuecomment-192713106","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1126","id":192713106,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MjcxMzEwNg==","user":{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-05T19:29:00Z","updated_at":"2016-03-05T19:29:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":":-). @artwr you also might want to have a look at 'get_pandas_df' as impyla provides its own for this (see impyla docs), but I  am not sure if this would be compatible with Airflow.
