The default is 0.`  \r\nThe default is 0, so, it will parse uploaded multipart file into memory, instead of writing to temp file.\r\n \r\nSo, I guess set the   spring.http.multipart.file-size-threshold   to a value like  10MB.  may avoid the OutOfMemory error\r\n \r\nspring.http.multipart.file-size-threshold=10MB\r\n \r\nCan you try whether this will reduce memory usage?\r\n \r\n—\r\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\r\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or
