The problem with a normal `TopDocs` or `TopFieldDocs` collector is that the empty PQ has some additional overhead (although the score is not calculated and returned as 0).\r\n\r\nFirst of all: SolrIndexSearcher should also implement support for using the optimized methods and collectors, unless a `DocSet` is needed (for facets/aggs). Using the `TotalHitCountCollector` is one thing to do (this needs to be done more down the line in the search code of Solr, but it's worth to do. But as there is now support to short-circuit count queries on the Query level, you should also think of using `IndexSearcher#count()` directly: E.g., this one returns `IndexReader#numDocs()` for `MatchAllDocsQuery` (thats a stupid simple case), but it can also return quick counts when there are no deleted docs in a segment and the statistics in index can answer the query.\r\n\r\nThe changes here look fine (although I can't follow the discussion about those crazy flags true/false/whatever), but in addition to the code here, in case of no TopDocs and no facets, the code should call `IndexSearcher#count()`. In the facet case, it should at least use the `TotalHitCountCollector` as the final sink.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1915232387/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1915447012","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2221#issuecomment-1915447012","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2221","id":1915447012,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5yK2bk","user":{"login":"dsmiley","id":377295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzI5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/377295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley","html_url":"https://github.com/dsmiley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-29T19:50:40Z","updated_at":"2024-01-29T19:50:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@uschindler See [getDocListNC](https://github.com/apache/solr/blob/326afddeddaa2092086e6f6b27f8bc35bf6d79cf/solr/core/src/java/org/apache/solr/search/SolrIndexSearcher.java#L1812) which already seems to be pretty well optimized when `lastDocRequested <= 0` (i.e. `rows==0`), and in conjunction also when `!needScores`.  The reason some of the Lucene convenience collectors & IndexSearcher.count aren't used is because this code is juggling a multitude of scenarios, such as when there might be a so-called `PostFilter`, thus leading to another Collector to add to the head of the collectors.

I decided that eliminating the `-c` was actually a step backwards for the user experience, especially when OTHER commands support it...

Does this mean we don't want users to use bin/post either? I think not.\r\n\r\nI think that is EXACTLY what we want.  no more `bin/post` and no more `bin/postlogs` either...   Neighter of them supports basic auth for example...   Neighter of them picks up SOLR_PORT, SOLR_HOST, etc variables...    each has weird special logic to make them executable...       Now, in the future, if someone wants to make a better CLI thatn bin/solr, or break it up into bin/server and bin/client, sure...  but yeah, in the short term, no more bin/post and no more bin/postlogs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1917634144/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1917646583","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2178#issuecomment-1917646583","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2178","id":1917646583,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5yTPb3","user":{"login":"risdenk","id":3384157,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzODQxNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3384157?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk","html_url":"https://github.com/risdenk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-30T18:28:44Z","updated_at":"2024-01-30T18:28:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@cpoerschke see https://lists.apache.org/thread/hlh1bmtgnmp55q8knhjtltf8t57pbl5q about unlicensed.

these \"Crave.io\" machines are just absolute monsters.\r\n\r\nThanks for pointing out the failure @iamsanjay .  According to fucit, TestPrepRecovery is pretty flaky - it's been failing on between 5 and 10% of runs since November or so.  So my guess is that it's not directly caused by anything in this PR.  But I'll kick off some 'beast' runs on it locally and try to find out.  Will update this ticket shortly.\r\n\r\n(If you're not familiar with \"[fucit](https://fucit.org/solr-jenkins-reports/failure-report.html)\", it's a really helpful test-aggregator that Chris Hostetter (who goes by \"Hoss man\") runs for us.  It gathers the test-reports from a bunch of Jenkins and other CI builds, and keeps track of how healthy or unhealthy each individual test has been historically.  It links out to the Jenkins builds for each failure so you can look at specific failures. \r\n Really really helpful stuff if you haven't seen it.)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1934306939/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1937845175","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1875#issuecomment-1937845175","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1875","id":1937845175,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5zgSu3","user":{"login":"epugh","id":22395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh","html_url":"https://github.com/epugh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-11T19:24:12Z","updated_at":"2024-02-11T19:24:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@gerlowskija
