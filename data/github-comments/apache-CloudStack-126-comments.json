This is too much to ask without guidance, especially as we try to improve the automatability of the testing.  \n\nThe regex idea is not a perfect solution, but would allow for us to handle more template types with a single entry.  Ideally we would be able to specify the expected values for this type of thing in an OS specific way so the tested (and verified) values for each OS can live in the test data. It would probably need a default that is used if the current OS does not have a match. \n\nMy main problem with this is that it will, by default,  break this test for everyone using bubble to automate their testing. Maybe we leave the old default test value in place, and people who are testing with other OSs can now override manually. \n\nWhat do you think?
