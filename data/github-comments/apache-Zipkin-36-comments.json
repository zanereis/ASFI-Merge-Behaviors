I would like to include the asynchronous span in the same trace. An alternative approach I can see (for v1 code) is to submit non-core (custom) annotations when consuming and producing (using the same spanId). It appears that Zipkin would not attempt to adjust for clock skew where the core annotations are not present. It also seems that it would derive the duration of the span from the difference between the newest and oldest timestamps of the custom annotations. I am not sure whether this will play nice with the rest of the tooling though (very new to this code base). Any thoughts on that?\n\nNote: Implied in the above is that we are sending the in-band tracing information (e.g. spanId) as metadata in the queued message.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/233188926/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/233214457","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1189#issuecomment-233214457","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1189","id":233214457,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMzIxNDQ1Nw==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-18T00:59:21Z","updated_at":"2016-07-18T00:59:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"To address the clock skew thing, pretend the producer action is a client\naction and the consumer action is a server one. these represent the\nboundaries of your two services, with kafka etc in the middle.\n\nThe problem is that there is kafka in the middle :) That said, the clock\nskew will be shifted anyway as regardless of that the consumer shouldn't\nreceive a message before it is produced.\n\nAnother (more dramatic approach) to clock skew could be to keep track of\nthings on the instrumentation side.

noted that the highest impact is more about the key count, not the length. Ex there's more benefit to reducing the (irrelevant) cardinality in the table vs the length.\n\n@danchia for example, I'm not sure anyone would do a key lookup by md5 of a long url :)\n\nThis indirectly reduces count by stripping things that are presumably volatile from being long. Ex query parameters in a signature tend to be (but are not always) long, so stripping them on account of length, may very likely reduce the count as well.\n\nAnother option could be to make a blacklist, ex `Signature`. Pro is that this could weed out urls unlikley to be search keys. Problem is that this requires special knowledge of the namespace, and adds maintenance the zipkin project can't likely help with...\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/233508632/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/233855644","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1194#issuecomment-233855644","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1194","id":233855644,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMzg1NTY0NA==","user":{"login":"prat0318","id":1528697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Mjg2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1528697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prat0318","html_url":"https://github.com/prat0318","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prat0318/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prat0318/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prat0318/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prat0318/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prat0318/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prat0318/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prat0318/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prat0318/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prat0318/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-20T06:49:57Z","updated_at":"2016-07-20T06:50:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"We added [off-heap](http://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/off-heap-memtables-in-Cassandra-2-1) memtable allocation of 20G which reduced the # of flushes and resulted in lesser compaction.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/233855644/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/233900378","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/1196#issuecomment-233900378","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1196","id":233900378,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMzkwMDM3OA==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-20T09:34:06Z","updated_at":"2016-07-20T09:34:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@jcarres-mdsol @marcingrzejszczak @shakuzen @eirslett need a second opinion on leaving the \"compute on demand\" around in mysql.

Ex. close the span after you've sent the message (ignoring that there was no response received).\n- You can close the span with something else (ex Brave's LocalTracer), which adds span duration without using RPC annotations. You should add \"ca\" (producer) and \"sa\" (consumer) on the span (to ensure the dependencies graph can show things).\n\nThings we could do here is investigate clock skew when no RPC spans exist in a trace. That could be bumped out as a separate issue, but I think it would only work if \"ca\" and \"sa\" are logged.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/234126991/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/234130953","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1194#issuecomment-234130953","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1194","id":234130953,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNDEzMDk1Mw==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-21T01:19:41Z","updated_at":"2016-07-21T01:19:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The only way to do this is somewhat basic.. put said file in front of the\nclasspath!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/234130953/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/234132229","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1194#issuecomment-234132229","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1194","id":234132229,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNDEzMjIyOQ==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-21T01:28:57Z","updated_at":"2016-07-21T01:28:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"in the case of docker you'd overwrite the file at\n/zipkin/cassandra-schema-cql3.txt\n\ndoing arbitrary upgrades could be dodgy. there's careful logic about\nthe upgrade, and it checks for very certain things because CQL can't\ndo everything.

I only needed to handle \"cs\" and \"sr\" with the ClientRequestInterceptor and ServerRequestInterceptor, but in order for Brave to submit the spans, I needed to make a dummy adapter and submit \"ss\" as well, not to close the span, but just so that Brave knew to submit it. This is suboptimal. I'm not even worrying about dependencies or duration.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/235094370/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/235113761","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1189#issuecomment-235113761","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1189","id":235113761,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNTExMzc2MQ==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-25T23:08:07Z","updated_at":"2016-07-25T23:08:07Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"If your goal is to measure latency of async spans, I think we can find\nsomething to work.\n\nIf your goal is to make a span with only \"cs\" and \"sr\" in it, I'm not\ninterested in helping as it will produce bugs elsewhere we'd have to clean\nup.

I tried a couple\nwith Kafka (stuffing SpanId into the message key, and using callbacks\nto close the producer span)\n- represent sending to the broker as a cs/cr and receiving from the\n  broker as sr/ss (in the same span)\n  - time in transport is the interval between cr and sr (noting you\n    can also log \"ws\" \"wr\" to show wire send attempts)\n  - plus is that you can do this with all instrumentation\n  - minus is the \"ss\" and \"cr\" parts are forged (ex you are really\n    capturing the overhead of send and receipt)\n- make an annotation \"mp\"(message produced) \"mc\"(message consumed) in\n  the same span (annotation doesn't matter, just that there are a pair).\n  - time in transport is the interval between these (noting you can\n    also log \"ws\" \"wr\" to show wire send attempts)\n  - plus is that it doesn't conflate with client/server annotations\n  - minus requires you to flush an incomplete span on both sides (not\n    all instrumentation allow this)\n- make a separate span for the consumer side\n  - time in transport is the interval between the end of the producer\n    span and the beginning of the consumer span\n  - plus is the diagram more clearly separates the producer from the\n    consumer (they are in different spans)\n  - this means you propagate the \"next span id\" to the other side\n\nI can share my kafka code if someone is interested

brave)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/235414726/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/235667667","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1203#issuecomment-235667667","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1203","id":235667667,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNTY2NzY2Nw==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-27T17:59:04Z","updated_at":"2016-07-27T17:59:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"great

Thank you for the quick feedback on this. It really helps to make these enhancements as useful as possible.\n\nI discussed this with @adriancole a little bit. There is no clear cut place to add this to the UI now and if we were going to make such a change, I'd rather someone more familiar than me with UI coding (specifically Zipkin's and in general) to be directly involved. If you would like to see that, can you make a separate issue for that, possibly suggesting where you envision such information would go?\n\nIn the meantime, @adriancole had a great suggestion for a way you could accomplish this after the changes in this pull request are released. Zipkin already [supports specifying an environment string](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/tree/master/zipkin-server#configuration-for-the-ui) that is displayed in the top right corner of the UI. You can include the version there using the property `info.zipkin.version`. So, for instance, you can run the following `java -jar zipkin.jar --zipkin.ui.environment=\\${info.zipkin.version}` (you can, of course, also set the property in any of the other ways [supported by Spring Boot](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.4.0.RELEASE/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html))\n\nI have tested this locally (you need the changes in this pull request to test). Let me know if that makes sense and is something that works for

Think of it like twitter itself. I\ncan't search twitter in reverse order and then by longest tweet.\nBottom-line, this isn't SQL: you can't do server-side sorts in arbitrary\norder in all backends.\n\nAnyway you ask for traces without putting a constraint on duration, there\nis no constraint. They are ranked by timestamp descending on the server.\nYou can put a duration constraint, but in the case of cassandra, the\nperformance of such a query is not yet sorted\nhttps://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/1204.\n\nI think the biggest problem is the UI element is confusing things.. it\nhints at a feature that doesn't exist.  It should be more clearly moved or\nworded to indicate that it is for resorting results, not a server-side\nordering task. I may be wrong in this thinking.\n\n  ps.
