From my first tries, it seems to work with respect to checkpointing Kafka state in a pipelined (non-blocking) fashion and to reuse it.\n\nHere are a few things I think should be addressed, to make sure that we get high code quality for this sensible piece of the system.\n- This seems to have reproducibly broken the `TaskManagerFailureRecoveryITCase.testRestartWithFailingTaskManager`. Probably through the additional \"restart()\" call in the execution graph. I am confused why it does not break more.\n- This Pull Request \"sneaks\" in a new job type flag, which marks jobs as \"batch\" or \"streaming\". I think this is definitely much needed, and we should make this more prominent.\n- Some commits introduce a completely new code style. I have recently written a mail to the mailing list with a discussion about more homogeneity in the project. This is a good example, where there is no good reason not to stick with the common style from the rest of the code. Makes the code much more readable if there is a common style behind it.\n- Related to the previous comment, there are quire a few unnecessary reformattings, which actually take code that was in the original common style, and change it to a different uncommon style.\n- There are many \"printStackTrace\" command and logging in general is neglected a bit. For a complex mechanism like this, it is super crucial as soon as you need to debug a deployed case.\n- Comments are missing big time. This code \n- Messages received by the JobManager/TaskManager which are dedicated for another actor can be \"forwarded\". That keeps the original sender, which helps in routing answers.\n- I would suggest to rename the \"StreamStateMonitor\" to something along the lines of \"StreamCheckpointCoordinator\".\n- The TaskManager and JobManager have quite a few different messages to handle, would be nice to do more communication endpoint to endpoint (state tracker to source). Not urgent, may be a future refactoring.\n- Along the lines of getting/maintaining a more coherent code base, I would vote to make new classes in the flink-runtime project in Java. Actors via \"UntypedActor\" are not too bad in Akka/Java.\n- I think the best way of desiging a resilinet system is to not make a distinction between the first execution, a recovery execution, a rebalance execution, ... They all should function the same way. There should be no dedicated code paths and flags \"onRecovery\". The only difference here is that initially, the state is empty, which can be modelled as state as well.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/77780578/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/77780751","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/459#issuecomment-77780751","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/459","id":77780751,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3NzgwNzUx","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-08T23:04:52Z","updated_at":"2015-03-08T23:04:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"For the sake of structure, can you also squash a few cleanup commits and prefix all commits consistently with issue numbers and component (https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Apache+Flink+development+guidelines)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/77780751/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/77781300","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/459#issuecomment-77781300","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/459","id":77781300,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3NzgxMzAw","user":{"login":"senorcarbone","id":858078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1ODA3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/858078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/senorcarbone","html_url":"https://github.com/senorcarbone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senorcarbone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senorcarbone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senorcarbone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senorcarbone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senorcarbone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senorcarbone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senorcarbone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senorcarbone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senorcarbone/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-08T23:16:31Z","updated_at":"2015-03-08T23:16:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"thanks for the review Stephan!

Otherwise, you lose most of the benefits (local processing) and would ship all data which is exactly what you want to avoid when using a combiner.

This is really good progress!\n\nI had a look at your code and noticed a few things apart from the inline comments.\n- PojoTypeInformation is unfortunately not serializable (as I had to learn a few days ago myself) because `java.lang.reflect.Field` is not serializable. So the InputFormat will not work if used in a complete Flink program. What you need to do to get the IF working is to add member variables for the POJO class and all field names. In the `open()` method you need to create the `Field` objects with `clazz.getDeclaredField(fieldName)` and use these fields in the `readRecord` method.\n- Add (at least) two end-to-end tests for the Java API and the Scala API that use the new Pojo feature. These tests will catch the TypeInformation serialization problem.\n\nPlease don't hesitate to get in touch if you have any questions!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/78276533/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/78298992","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/479#issuecomment-78298992","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/479","id":78298992,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4Mjk4OTky","user":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-11T16:26:16Z","updated_at":"2015-03-11T16:26:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I set the `{{ site.baseurl }}` to http://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-master and the local preview is started with `--baseurl \"\"`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/78298992/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/78300593","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/479#issuecomment-78300593","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/479","id":78300593,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4MzAwNTkz","user":{"login":"mxm","id":837221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNzIyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/837221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm","html_url":"https://github.com/mxm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-11T16:33:50Z","updated_at":"2015-03-11T16:33:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Nice solution.

and it certainly makes sense if you want to ship pre-builds of both versions. With the current setup if you want to use Flink with 2.11 you have to build and install the maven projects yourself (I'm blindly following the Spark model here, let me know if you prefer the other option).\n\nThats not entirely true: Users have to build Flink with 2.11 themselves and then Build their project with `-Dscala-2.11` to activate the profile inside our pom (on `install` maven does not rewrite poms)\n\nSo I'm in favor of adding a `_2.11` suffix to all affected Flink artifacts.\nBut this is really a major change that we really need to discuss on the mailing

I think it's a good fix, **but**:\n\nI noticed that `DegreesWithExceptionITCase.testGetDegreesInvalidEdgeSrcId`is sometimes failing (for example here: https://s3.amazonaws.com/archive.travis-ci.org/jobs/53985893/log.txt). I initially thought that it was a problem of my runtime changes in #471, but the problem is the following:\n\nYou expect a certain exception msg (\"The edge src/trg id could not be found within the vertexIds\") for the test to pass. But in the getDegrees() test there is a reducer following the coGroup (this one throws the expected exception), which can also fail with another exception, because of the cancelling before in the coCroup. If this other exception gets reported to the client, the test fails.\n\nI think it would be enough to test that the job fails or even think about whether it makes sense to cover this in a unit test of the operator, because imo it all boils down to the behaviour of the degree computing coGroup, which throws the expected `NoSuchElementException`.\n\n---\n\nOther than that:\n- Initially I thought whether you should extends MultipleProgramsTestBase as in other test cases, but I think that doesn't work with the Exception checking.

the questions:\n1.  I think deploying after all blocking producers are finished is what we should go for as a start. It is also what people would expect from a blocking model.\n2.  This is a fair initial restriction. Let's relax that later, I can see benefits in that when dealing with tasks that cannot be deployed due to a a lack of resources.\n\nA few questions:\n\nThe pull request generifies the IOManager and uses asynchronous disk I/O for the intermediate result spilling. Are there any experience points that this helps performance in the case here? I am curious, because the async I/O in the hash join / sorters was tricky enough. The interaction between asynchronous disk I/O and asynchronous network I/O must be very tricky. I think there should be a good reason to do this, otherwise we simply introduce error prone code for a completely unknown benefit.\n\nThe asynchronous writing seems straightforward. For the reading / sending part:\n- When do you issue the read requests to the reader (from disk)? Is that dependent on when the TCP channel is writable?\n- When the read request is issued, before the response comes, if the subpartition de-registered from netty and the re-registered one a buffer has returned from disk?\n- Given many spilled partitions, which one is read from next? How is the buffer assignment realized? There is a lot of trickyness in there, because disk I/O performs well with longer sequential reads, but that may occupy many buffers that are missing for other reads into writable TCP channels.\n\nCan you elaborate on the mechanism behind this? I expect this to have quite an impact on the reliability of the mechanism and the performance.\n\n_IMPORTANT_: There has been a fix by @tillrohrmann to the Asynchronous Channel Readers / Writers a few weeks back . Are we sure that this is not undone by the changes here?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/78474538/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/78479167","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/471#issuecomment-78479167","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/471","id":78479167,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4NDc5MTY3","user":{"login":"uce","id":1756620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTY2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1756620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce","html_url":"https://github.com/uce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-12T13:30:57Z","updated_at":"2015-03-12T13:30:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The root \"cause\" of all asynchronous operations is that TCP connections are shared among multiple logical channels, which are handled by a fixed number of network I/O threads. In case of synchronous I/O operations, we would essentially block progress on all channels sharing that connection/thread.\n\n> When do you issue the read requests to the reader (from disk)? Is that dependent on when the TCP channel is writable?\n\nYes, the network I/O thread has subpartitions queued for transfer and only queries them for data when the TCP channel is writable.\n\n> When the read request is issued, before the response comes, if the subpartition de-registered from netty and the re-registered one a buffer has returned from disk?\n\nExactly. If there is no buffer available, the read request is issued and the next available subpartition is tried. If none of the subpartitions has data available, the network I/O thread works on another TCP channel (this is done by Netty, which multiplexes all TCP channels over a fixed amount of network I/O threads).\n\n> Given many spilled partitions, which one is read from next? How is the buffer assignment realized? There is a lot of trickyness in there, because disk I/O performs well with longer sequential reads, but that may occupy many buffers that are missing for other reads into writable TCP channels.\n\nInitially this depends on the order of partition requests. After that on the order of data availability. \nRegarding the buffers: trickyness, indeed. The current state with the buffers is kind of an intermediate solution as we will issue zero-transfer reads in the future (requires minimal changes), where we essentially only trigger reads to gather offsets. The reads are then only affected by TCP channel writability. Currently, the reads are batched in sizes of two buffers (64k).\n\n---\n\nRegarding @tillrohrmann's changes: what was this exactly? Then I can verify that the changes are not undone.\n\nIn general (minus the question regarding Till's changes) I think this PR is good to merge. The tests are stable and passing. There will be definitely a need to do refactorings and performance evaluations, but I think that is to be expected with such a big change.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/78479167/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/78480294","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/442#issuecomment-78480294","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/442","id":78480294,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4NDgwMjk0","user":{"login":"Elbehery","id":2375289,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNzUyODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2375289?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Elbehery","html_url":"https://github.com/Elbehery","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Elbehery/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Elbehery/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Elbehery/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Elbehery/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Elbehery/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Elbehery/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Elbehery/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Elbehery/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Elbehery/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-12T13:37:24Z","updated_at":"2015-03-12T13:37:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@rmetzger  This is the standard Tweet format as per Twitter.
