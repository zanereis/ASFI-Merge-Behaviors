the beans of `ShardingAlgorithm` and `KeyGenerateAlgorithm` have a similar format but with a different meaning, which is likely to confuse the user.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<bean

fact, `<sharding:key-generator id=\"orderKeyGenerator\" column=\"order_id\" type=\"INCREMENT\" />` is the old api before #1997, in this way keyGenerator was instanced by ServiceLoader which could not

TaoZhiMLND and I have made many work in order to keep the old api but it is not possible to create 2 different beans in one spring tag, so we separate the KeyGeneratorAlgorithm from the

Now, we need to provide SPI spring namespace configuration for all the sharding algorithms.\r\n\r\n### What is wanted\r\nUse the following configuration format\r\n```xml\r\n <spi:sharding-algorithm id=\"standardModuloDatabaseShardingAlgorithm\" type=\"STANDARD_TEST_DB\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\ninstead of\r\n```xml\r\n <bean id=\"standardModuloDatabaseShardingAlgorithm\" class=\"org.apache.shardingsphere.shardingjdbc.spring.algorithm.StandardModuloDatabaseShardingAlgorithm\" />\r\n```\r\n### How\r\n1. Refer to #5190 to learn how to use `beanFactory` to call `TypedSPIRegistry`\r\n2. Provide `spi:sharding-algorithm` for users to configure.\r\n3. Modify all the bean configurations of `shardingAlgorithm`.\r\n\r\n### Tips\r\n1. `KeyGenerateAlgorithmBeanDefinitionParser` is an example.\r\n2. `ShardingStrategyBeanDefinitionParser` is our target.\r\n3. [Configuration Comparison](https://github.com/apache/incubator-shardingsphere/pull/5177/files) shows how to use new configuration in YAML fille.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/613883574/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/613885041","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/5196#issuecomment-613885041","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/5196","id":613885041,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMzg4NTA0MQ==","user":{"login":"tristaZero","id":27757146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NzU3MTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27757146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero","html_url":"https://github.com/tristaZero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-15T08:05:42Z","updated_at":"2020-04-15T08:05:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@TaoZhiMLND Hi would like to tackle this one?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/613885041/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/613885875","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/5196#issuecomment-613885875","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/5196","id":613885875,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMzg4NTg3NQ==","user":{"login":"strongduanmu","id":10829171,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODI5MTcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10829171?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/strongduanmu","html_url":"https://github.com/strongduanmu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strongduanmu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strongduanmu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strongduanmu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strongduanmu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strongduanmu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strongduanmu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strongduanmu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strongduanmu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strongduanmu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-15T08:07:08Z","updated_at":"2020-04-15T08:07:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I want to solve this issue.
