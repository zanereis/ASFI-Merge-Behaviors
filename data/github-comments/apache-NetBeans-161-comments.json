Is that a manual process? Who does it?\r\n\r\nApologies to those who already know this but as I understand it, the process is\r\n1. native stubs are built (once)\r\n2. native stubs are uploaded (once)\r\n3. stubs are downloaded (by anyone building Netbeans)\r\n4. metadata and the actual installer java jar is appended to the stub to make the native installer (every time Netbeans is built)\r\n\r\nWhat I checked was that if I took a _bona fide_ NB17 installer and overwrote the stub with a stub that I had built myself, it still functioned. I wasn't able to test the uploading/downloading part.\r\n\r\nNow that Eric has uploaded it, I should be able to test the full process of building a Netbeans installer (i.e. steps 3 & 4 above) which I will do but  it will probably be tomorrow.\r\n\r\nNote that the stub's only job is to get the real java installer running, so it's independent of the NB version; we won't need to touch the uploaded zip file for successive NB releases. (might influence what we choose for the filename?)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1505771843/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1505844205","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/5763#issuecomment-1505844205","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5763","id":1505844205,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5ZwVvt","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-12T19:58:13Z","updated_at":"2023-04-12T19:58:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@jlahoda do you think this is good to merge or should we wait for another review?

It is likely that we can make the index a bit smaller by using filters and improve extraction time a bit just by updating the dependencies (but this has to wait for now unfortunately).\r\n\r\nThere will be likely a setting for multi threading which should cut extraction time at least in half on most systems (my old i7 6700k extracts in 6 mins with that change). However, if you are having problems with spinning fans now, multi threading will make it worse (they will spin shorter though). Notebooks aren't that good for sustained load.\r\n\r\nNB 18 will provide a setting to disable remote index extraction, while allowing to keep local .m2 scanning enabled (which is super fast). This might work pretty well for a lot of use cases. #5646 shows a screenshot of the new settings.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1507265348/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1507407156","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/5809#issuecomment-1507407156","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5809","id":1507407156,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5Z2TU0","user":{"login":"webracer999","id":992620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5MjYyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/992620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/webracer999","html_url":"https://github.com/webracer999","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webracer999/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webracer999/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webracer999/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webracer999/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webracer999/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webracer999/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webracer999/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webracer999/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webracer999/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-13T18:08:27Z","updated_at":"2023-04-13T18:08:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you @mbien for the information!\r\n\r\nBTW I have an \"Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-8265U CPU @ 1.60GHz\" (`/proc/cpuinfo`) and 16 GB RAM.

The claim overlooks, that java supports covariant returns, which is implemented by synthesized bridge methods, that are added by the compiler.\r\n\r\n`ClassInfo` iterates the methods and uses the first matching method. Then the return type of that method is assumed to find the setter.
