have been running with this patch for a couple of weeks now. I *think* it has removed a lot of previously very annoying errors, or at least saved me from doing a complete clean build every time they occur (\"Annotation: An error occurred during parsing\", \"Absent Code attribute in method\", \"The bytes do not represent a valid class\" etc.)\r\n\r\nDoes this patch impact \"Apply Code Changes\" in any way? (That feature has always been very flaky... yet it is so incredibly useful that I use it anyway.)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/421203742/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/421226413","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/875#issuecomment-421226413","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/875","id":421226413,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMTIyNjQxMw==","user":{"login":"jlahoda","id":124144,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDE0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/124144?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda","html_url":"https://github.com/jlahoda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-14T04:19:53Z","updated_at":"2018-09-14T04:19:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@geertjanw, yes, this should fix that.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/421226413/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/421541341","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/878#issuecomment-421541341","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/878","id":421541341,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMTU0MTM0MQ==","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-15T08:35:11Z","updated_at":"2018-09-15T08:35:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The change itself looks sane.
