Then we have EC2 instance(s) with a kubernetes cluster. One of the pods is an nginx-ingress pod that reverse proxies the services in the cluster for multiple namespaces. One of the services is Zipkin in the monitoring namespace.\r\n\r\nThe ingress-nginx configuration:\r\n```apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1\r\nkind: Ingress\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: cbo-ingress-mgmt-elb\r\n  labels:\r\n    app: ingressservice-mgmt-elb\r\n  annotations:\r\n    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: \"nginx\"\r\n    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: \"/\"\r\n    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: \"false\"\r\nspec:\r\n  rules:\r\n  - host: management.test.cbo\r\n    http:\r\n      paths:\r\n      - backend:\r\n          serviceName: authentication-service\r\n          servicePort: 8210\r\n        path: /authentication\r\n      - backend:\r\n          serviceName: authorization-service\r\n          servicePort: 8160\r\n        path: /authorization\r\n      - backend:\r\n          serviceName: configuration-service\r\n          servicePort: 8110\r\n        path: /configuration\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\napiVersion: extensions/v1beta1\r\nkind: Ingress\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: cbo-ingress-mgmt-elb\r\n  namespace: monitoring\r\n  labels:\r\n    app: ingressservice-mgmt-elb\r\n  annotations:\r\n    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: \"nginx\"\r\n    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: \"/\"\r\n    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: \"false\"\r\nspec:\r\n  rules:\r\n  - host: management.test.cbo\r\n    http:\r\n      paths:\r\n      - backend:\r\n          serviceName: alertmanager\r\n          servicePort: 9093\r\n        path: /alertmanager\r\n      - backend:\r\n          serviceName: elasticsearch-proxy\r\n          servicePort: 9200\r\n        path: /elasticsearch\r\n      - backend:\r\n          serviceName: grafana\r\n          servicePort: 3000\r\n        path: /grafana\r\n      - backend:\r\n          serviceName: kibana\r\n          servicePort: 5601\r\n        path: /kibana\r\n      - backend:\r\n          serviceName: prometheus-monitoring\r\n          servicePort: 9090\r\n        path: /prometheus\r\n      - backend:\r\n          serviceName: zipkin-service\r\n          servicePort: 9411\r\n        path: /zipkin\r\n```\r\nAnd the Zipkin configuration:\r\n```\r\napiVersion: v1\r\nkind: Service\r\nmetadata:\r\n  namespace: monitoring\r\n  name: zipkin-service\r\nspec:\r\n  ports:\r\n    - port: 9411\r\n  selector:\r\n    app: zipkin\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\napiVersion: extensions/v1beta1\r\nkind: Deployment\r\nmetadata:\r\n  namespace: monitoring\r\n  name: zipkin\r\nspec:\r\n  replicas: 1\r\n  selector:\r\n    matchLabels:\r\n      app: zipkin\r\n  template:\r\n    metadata:\r\n      labels:\r\n        app: zipkin\r\n    spec:\r\n      containers:\r\n      - name: zipkin\r\n        image: openzipkin/zipkin:2.5.3\r\n        env:\r\n         - name: STORAGE_TYPE\r\n           value: elasticsearch\r\n         - name: ES_HOSTS\r\n           value: http://elasticsearch-proxy:9200\r\n         - name: ES_DATE_SEPARATOR\r\n           value: .\r\n         - name: ZIPKIN_UI_BASEPATH\r\n           value: \"/zipkin/zipkin\"\r\n```\r\nThe separate configurations result in one concatenated nginx.conf file.\r\nThe crucial thing is that we cannot change `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: \"/\"` which is applied to all backends.\r\n\r\nNow that this issue has been fixed it works.\r\nIf we set up the SSH tunnel with the bastion now, and curl to /zipkin, we get:\r\n```\r\n$ curl -vvv -L http://management.test.cbo:13370/zipkin\r\n*   Trying 127.0.0.1...\r\n* TCP_NODELAY set\r\n* Connected to management.test.cbo (127.0.0.1) port 13370 (#0)\r\n> GET /zipkin HTTP/1.1\r\n> Host: management.test.cbo:13370\r\n> User-Agent: curl/7.54.0\r\n> Accept: */*\r\n> \r\n< HTTP/1.1 302 Found\r\n< Date: Thu, 15 Mar 2018 10:32:57 GMT\r\n< Location: ./zipkin/\r\n< Server: nginx/1.13.8\r\n< vary: origin\r\n< X-Application-Context: zipkin-server:shared:9411\r\n< Content-Length: 0\r\n< Connection: keep-alive\r\n< \r\n* Connection #0 to host management.test.cbo left intact\r\n* Issue another request to this URL: 'http://management.test.cbo:13370/zipkin/'\r\n* Found bundle for host management.test.cbo: 0x7fdb19c21450 [can pipeline]\r\n* Re-using existing connection!

Technically, it might sound the same, but it's not.

It uses some Spring Boot classes that were changed in a backwards-incompatible way from 1 → 2, as can be expected in a major version.\r\n\r\n> Afaik, something like `@EnableEurekaServer` works on Spring Boot 1.x and Spring Boot 2.x.\r\n\r\nIt's possible some annotation could work fine across major versions of a dependency if underneath nothing depended on a class that changed in a breaking way. However, this would be somewhat by chance. That is to say, Spring Cloud's release train Finchley supports Spring Boot 2 and does not support Spring Boot 1. Release trains prior to Finchley support Spring Boot 1 and not Spring Boot 2. Something that works with both does so without any guarantee from the Spring Cloud team.\r\n\r\nWhile in some cases it's _technically_ possible (and feasible) to support multiple major versions of libraries (e.g. Hibernate 4 and 5) at the same time using things like reflection to check for available classes/methods, in most cases a given version of a library will support one set of major (and possibly minor) version of each dependency due to maintenance costs. This is particularly true for something as core as a framework dependency. Look at the example in this issue: the class in Spring Boot 2 that needs to be used doesn't exist in Spring Boot 1 and vice versa.\r\n\r\n> Would it be hard to support both versions?\r\n\r\nYes, it is a major version release that made breaking changes. I doubt there are many libraries simultaneously supporting Spring Boot 1 and 2 in the same version.\r\n\r\n@bodiam \r\nThat all being said, even given your preference to push source code, you don't need to use Spring Boot 2 right now. Your applications can run on Spring Boot 1 or 2 and still send spans to Zipkin whether it is running on Spring Boot 1 or 2 (with the version that supports each, of course). These are, by design, independent choices. If you want to maintain source code with `@EnableZipkinServer` that works with Spring Boot 1, then you can still deploy a Zipkin Server in your preferred manner. When Zipkin switches to Spring Boot 2, you will have to switch your custom Zipkin Server to Spring Boot 2 when upgrading to that version of Zipkin or later.\r\n\r\nA custom server can work and might be the right solution for you, but we don't have enough resources to troubleshoot all the many things that can go wrong when making a custom Zipkin Server. Especially when we expect the packaged Zipkin Server to meet the majority of people's needs. If there is a need it doesn't fulfill, we would love to hear about that (thank you for sharing your situation about your deployment pipeline/process). Hence the short answer is: right now Zipkin is only compatible with Spring Boot 1. When it changes to Spring Boot 2, it will only run with that. This is all versioned, of course, so if you must make a custom server, you will have to use the version that works with the version of Spring Boot you choose to run. The same way you have to pick the compatible version of Spring Cloud or any other library that builds on Spring Boot.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n@bodiam \r\nI just noticed that you mentioned `@EnableZipkinStreamServer`. The stream server was deprecated and has been removed from Sleuth in 2.0 (Finchley release train) as mentioned in [the migration guide](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-sleuth/wiki/Spring-Cloud-Sleuth-2.0-Migration-Guide#sleuth-stream) and in the documentation ([1.3.x](http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/spring-cloud-sleuth/1.3.0.RELEASE/single/spring-cloud-sleuth.html#_sleuth_with_zipkin_via_rabbitmq_or_kafka) and [2.0.x](http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/spring-cloud-sleuth/2.0.0.M9/single/spring-cloud-sleuth.html#_sending_spans_to_zipkin)). As mentioned there, a vanilla Zipkin server and recent versions of Sleuth work fine sending and receiving spans over Kafka, RabbitMQ, or HTTP.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/375872410/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/375874457","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1962#issuecomment-375874457","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1962","id":375874457,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NTg3NDQ1Nw==","user":{"login":"bodiam","id":46468,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46468?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bodiam","html_url":"https://github.com/bodiam","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bodiam/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bodiam/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bodiam/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bodiam/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bodiam/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bodiam/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bodiam/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bodiam/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bodiam/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-24T11:18:21Z","updated_at":"2018-03-24T13:02:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@shakuzen Thanks for the amazing writeup.
