If there is support from the community, I will move on to other components, though any html will just pass through, so it shouldn't garble, and will likely improve any existing javadoc.</p>\n\n<p>    The first commit adds the corresponding maven javadoc plugin to the default build. This means it will increase build time when you run `mvn install`, but it will also spit out warnings about javadoc problems and may encourage developers to fix or improve documentation problems.</p>\n\n<p>    The second commit is a quick pass over `storm-core` to remove unnecessary HTML and some minor javadoc comment linting. Only javadoc comments were modified.</p>\n\n<p>    The third commit adds the `highlight.js` license to both the source and binary LICENSE files, since the generated javadoc includes it. I'm not sure this is necessary, since the JavaDoc is generated, but I will find out if there's support for this patch.</p>\n\n<p>    <b>Note:</b> The <span class=\"error\">&#91;pegdown-doclet licence&#93;</span>(<a href=\"https://github.com/Abnaxos/pegdown-doclet/blob/master/LICENSE.txt\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/Abnaxos/pegdown-doclet/blob/master/LICENSE.txt</a>) is GPL, but it's only used at build time, so that does not seem to present a licensing issue.</p>\n\n<p>You can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:</p>\n\n<p>    $ git pull <a href=\"https://github.com/ptgoetz/storm\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/ptgoetz/storm</a> markdown-javadoc</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/891.patch\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/891.patch</a></p>\n\n<p>To close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch<br/>\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:</p>\n\n<p>    This closes #891</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>commit e03b28ca6222f61471b4acb1a6086aab9b597b8a<br/>\nAuthor: P.

I see some indented at 2 spaces, some at 4.  Also, I see some inconsistent initial indentation.\n- Some of these methods are synchronized and hold a lock on Utils while they access ZK.  I can see this causing lots of problems.  Can we try and use more granular locking?
