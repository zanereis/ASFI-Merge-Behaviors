Specifically, I deployed the contributions to an existing cluster. The existing cluster had already stored state in ZK using the configuration from the state-management.xml. During start up the nodes were unable to heartbeat into ZK because the configuration in state-management.xml had used a username/password. In order for the heartbeats to be stored the ZK connection from nifi.properties would also need to be configured with the same credentials.\n\nAs I mentioned in the PR for #301 we should address having duplicate connect string in nifi.properties and state-management.xml for ZK. A short term fix for addressing this issue would be to additionally duplicate the remaining ZK configuration from state-management to nifi.properties. We could take this temporary approach while we discuss a more appropriate long term strategy for ZK configuration prior the first 1.x release. Or alternatively, we could address that issue prior to re-submitting this PR.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/204434802/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/204498317","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/317#issuecomment-204498317","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/317","id":204498317,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNDQ5ODMxNw==","user":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-01T18:08:35Z","updated_at":"2016-04-01T18:08:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mcgilman I agree - we certainly need to address the duplication of configuration.

When we create 'container' nodes in ZooKeeper whose paths are not sensitive, we will mark the node as wide-open, rather than applying ACLs. This allows us to not have to worry about if we have state management and heartbeats using different ACLs.\n\nAlso removed use of username/passwords from ZooKeeper configuration.

Here's my reply which I originally made on the JIRA:\n\n# \n\nMy use case around PutSlack at this point is pretty simple. Basically the same use cases around PutEmail, but sending to a Slack channel instead of an email distribution list. This allows teams to keep an eye on their dataflows in a natural place, especially since many other Slack integrations exist (Jenkins, github, etc).\n\nTo configure PutSlack, a Slack user (or maybe admin) has to add the Incoming Webhooks integration to the Slack team, then add a webhook to a specific channel. Once the user has the URL associated with this webhook, they drop the URL into PutSlack along with a webhook text template.\n\nDoes that help? The use cases would probably also increase with a GetSlack processor, which when paired with PutSlack could allow one to manually trigger flows in NiFi via a chat bot.\n\n# \n\nAlso, just to be clear, the Travis build above failed on JDK8 due to an out of memory exception unrelated to PutSlack. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/206686328/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/206705777","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/246#issuecomment-206705777","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/246","id":206705777,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNjcwNTc3Nw==","user":{"login":"alopresto","id":798465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODQ2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/798465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto","html_url":"https://github.com/alopresto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-07T05:40:55Z","updated_at":"2016-04-07T05:40:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@adamonduty Will do in the morning.

Some feedback:\n- The commit message and the PR will need to associate to some open JIRA.  If the JIRA were say NIFI-XYZ1 then the commit message should have \"NIFI-XYZ1 ...the message\"\n- The batch size does documentation does need to be changed.  The change to a new default number of 16KB is fine but changing the name of the property is not ideal as it would break compatibility.  You can change the display name safely but it is already appropriate.\n- The description you gave is good.\n- I like your change to using the data size validator but the problem is this would make all existing configurations invalid as they'd need to add the unit to their value.  I am +0 on changing that personally as we do have provisions to deal with it and can document it in a migration guide.  However, thinking further on it I'm told on older versions of Kafka that batch size really was about the number of messages so changing it may not be ideal.\n\nYou could choose to simply fix the description of the property and leave the rest for now.  There is an actively under work PR/JIRA to move to supporting the 0.9 Kafka producer and consumer API and that will give us a chance to tighten some of these behaviors up as well.

looks pretty good, but in testing I came across 2 problems that need to be addressed before it can be merged.\n1. The example in the [expression language guide](https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/322/files#diff-daac74ec3b89e26d99806d7a90254fe3R1313) should be `${random():mod(10):plus(1)}` since EL uses [plus](http://nifi.apache.org/docs/nifi-docs/html/expression-language-guide.html#plus) for addition.\n2. Though Math.Random appears to only return positive floats, `nextLong()` must be returning positive and negative numbers.  Using the example expression I get numbers between -100 and 100 showing in the attributes.  The documentation should reflect that this could be positive or negative and the example needs to be adjusted for that as well.\n\nIn spite of the problems, nice job incorporating the EL Guide changes!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/211107429/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/211126729","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/360#issuecomment-211126729","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/360","id":211126729,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMTEyNjcyOQ==","user":{"login":"olegz","id":172397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjM5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/172397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz","html_url":"https://github.com/olegz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-17T23:07:00Z","updated_at":"2016-04-17T23:07:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Changes
