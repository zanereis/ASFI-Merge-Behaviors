If it is not provided, then the code will perform as it did before.\n\n# Example Configuration\n\nTo allow encrypted password to be used when gobblin in run under yarn, you need to make sure that the master password file is copied to the app_master and containers.  This is done by adding `/opt/apps/gobblin/current/master.pass` to `gobblin.yarn.app.master.files.local` and `gobblin.yarn.container.files.local`.  Additionally, `encrypt.key.fs.uri` needs to specify the local filesystem `\"file:///\"` and `encrypt.key.loc` need specify the master password file at the root of the current directory `master.pass`.\n\nSee the example below:\n\n```\ngobblin.yarn.app.master.files.local=${gobblin.yarn.conf.dir}\"/log4j-yarn.properties,\"${gobblin.yarn.conf.dir}\"/application.conf,\"${gobblin.yarn.conf.dir}\"/reference.conf,{{ app_current_dir }}/master.pass\"\ngobblin.yarn.container.files.local=${gobblin.yarn.app.master.files.local}\n...\nencrypt.key.fs.uri=\"file:///\"\nencrypt.key.loc=master.pass\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/186706594/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/187311925","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/716#issuecomment-187311925","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/716","id":187311925,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4NzMxMTkyNQ==","user":{"login":"pcadabam-zz","id":1166372,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjYzNzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1166372?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz","html_url":"https://github.com/pcadabam-zz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-22T18:39:50Z","updated_at":"2016-02-22T18:39:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tuGithub can you review this?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/187311925/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/187417009","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/737#issuecomment-187417009","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/737","id":187417009,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4NzQxNzAwOQ==","user":{"login":"kadaan","id":1904898,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDQ4OTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1904898?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan","html_url":"https://github.com/kadaan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-22T22:27:34Z","updated_at":"2016-02-22T22:27:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@sahilTakiar Can you speed this one through?

If not we try 10002.  And so on.  It will still be “random” in Yarn because there are multiple container on the same node, so the JVM input argument logging will still be needed.  \n\nAs a longer term item, it would be really nice to be able to “classify” the ports and expose them via the admin UI.
