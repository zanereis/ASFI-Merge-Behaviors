Davor,\n\nUpdated the comments. Let me know if it is better or worse ;).\n\nChanged a bit the downloading to add a sanity check (we could replace it by a checksum but the best would be to be able to use gpg --verify but seems bouncycastle doesn't fully match gpg format).\n\nThis repo is not really random since it is provided by an asf committer and I downgraded to a signed binary version. A maybe better alternative is to package a beam-hadoop-win jar with this exe and just explode it if running tests on windows - drawback is we put a binary in a jar, advantage is beam owns this binary.\n\nwdyt?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/227378303/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/227426451","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/1#issuecomment-227426451","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/1","id":227426451,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNzQyNjQ1MQ==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-21T12:37:16Z","updated_at":"2016-06-21T12:37:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[![Coverage

It does find the winutils.exe from hadoop home which is ATM not set in beam. If you have locally hadoop with winutils.exe - not provided by ASF yet - and set the home properly then most of tests - excepted the one using Path but that's something else - should be fine but if you don't you need that workaround cause Shell of hadoop get winutils in a static block (https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/trunk/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/util/Shell.java#L639) and it can be null. If null it will not remove the option but execute commands with a null entry in the array (processbuilder.execute([null, \"chmod\", ....])) which leads to a NPE.\n\nSide note: if you are curious chmod is implemented like that https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/trunk/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/main/winutils/chmod.c with win API\n\nWe can also propose to hadoop a degraded mode where if winutils is not there and a \"test\" flag activated we try to do these operations in java and if it fails we ignore them when acceptable (chmod/chown should be ok to ignore for tests for instance). Didn't check if it would be doable for all winutils operations.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/227510951/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/227511201","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/510#issuecomment-227511201","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/510","id":227511201,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNzUxMTIwMQ==","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-21T17:24:59Z","updated_at":"2016-06-21T17:24:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"R: @bjchambers \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/227511201/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/227512883","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/509#issuecomment-227512883","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/509","id":227512883,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNzUxMjg4Mw==","user":{"login":"davorbonaci","id":8442684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NDI2ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8442684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davorbonaci","html_url":"https://github.com/davorbonaci","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davorbonaci/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davorbonaci/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davorbonaci/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davorbonaci/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davorbonaci/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davorbonaci/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davorbonaci/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davorbonaci/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davorbonaci/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-21T17:31:00Z","updated_at":"2016-06-21T17:31:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"LGTM on the current version (runtime scope + removal of `org.apache.beam.sdk.util.GroupAlsoByWindowViaWindowSetDoFn`).\n\nPlease squash / self-merge, once test pass.
