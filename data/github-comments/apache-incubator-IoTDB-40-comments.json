But user will be confused if he uses `InsertTablet` API to insert Binary objects and gets unexcepted ones.\r\n\r\nMaybe we can indicate that only valid UTF-8 String supported in TEXT type in `InsertRecord()`, and it will support any bytes in the future.

  经过2个月的开发，IoTDB-Admin，一款IotDB的可视化管理系统0.12版本诞生了，这个项目前后有10来位开源爱好者参与，我们打算今天到7月底进行公测。开发过程中，IotDB官方团队（黄老师、乔博士）给与了大量的支持帮助，团队成员也从中收获颇多，我们将用接下来的2年完善该产品，与IotDB一起进步。产品目前属于第一版，还有很多功能没有开发完成，算是一个最小迭代，希望大家不吝指教，有产品需求、程序设计原理问题、功能bug欢迎告诉我们，可以直接@我或者我们的小伙伴，我们一定会认真记录，并不断进步。\r\n   最后，想加入IoTDB-Admin开发的同学可以联系小穆老师或者我，IoTDB-Admin可以作为进入IotDB殿堂的入门训练，感谢大家的支持。\r\n\r\n   公测地址: 113.207.43.87:9090\r\n   用户名：root\r\n   密码： 123456  (请勿更改密码)\r\n\r\n\r\nIoTDB-Admin意见反馈
