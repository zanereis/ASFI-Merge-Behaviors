Likewise, we can ignore anything related to weight initialization.\r\n\r\nPyTorch has the following additional arguments:\r\n- `padding_idx: int`, index into embedding table that will always have 0 gradient, generally used for padding\r\n- `scale_grad_by_freq: boolean`, \"scale gradients by the inverse of frequency of the words in the mini-batch.\" I believe this means the gradient update for index `j` will be divided by `sum(indices == j)` (count of `j` in input indices).\r\n- `sparse: boolean`: \"gradient w.r.t. weight matrix will be a sparse tensor.\"\r\n\r\nmxnet has:\r\n- `sparse_grad: boolean`: gradient for weight is row-sparse (probably the same as PyTorch above?)\r\n\r\nTF/keras has:\r\n- `mask_zero: boolean`: \"whether or not the input value 0 is a special \"padding\" value that should be masked out. This is useful when using recurrent layers which may take variable length input. If this is True, then all subsequent layers in the model need to support masking or an exception will be raised. If mask_zero is set to True, as a consequence, index 0 cannot be used in the vocabulary (input_dim should equal size of vocabulary + 1).\" I don't fully understand this but it seems similar to `padding_idx` from PyTorch, but requires TF-specific masking support. I prefer PyTorch's approach if they are both equivalent.\r\n- `input_length: int`: \"Length of input sequences, when it is constant. This argument is required if you are going to connect Flatten then Dense layers upstream (without it, the shape of the dense outputs cannot be computed).\" Again, this sounds like some kind of TF/Keras design quirk.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, we should aim for PyTorch's API over TF/Keras, but perhaps others can give more insight. We are also thinking about adding sparse gradient support, so it may be best to add it as an `attr` but raise an error for now.\r\n\r\n### Shapes\r\nPyTorch and mxnet support arbitrary input shape. In particular, if our embedding dimension is `dim`, the shape relation is `(d1,...,dn) -> (d1,...,dn, dim)`. \r\n\r\nTF/Keras is strange as they have `(batch_size, input_length) -> (batch_size, input_length, dim)`, which just seems like a restriction of PyTorch and mxnet.\r\n\r\nThis PR currently proposes `(flat_length,) -> (flat_length, dim)`. Note that we can easily support the PyTorch and mxnet approach by flattening the indices and then \"reshaping the first n dimensions\": `(d1,...,dn) -> (d1 * ... * dn) -> (d1 * ... * dn, dim) -> (d1,...,dn,dim)`. I imagine this should be easy to implement but I'm not too familiar with TOPI.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/719116287/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/719117205","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6794#issuecomment-719117205","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6794","id":719117205,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxOTExNzIwNQ==","user":{"login":"altanh","id":3124994,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjQ5OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3124994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/altanh","html_url":"https://github.com/altanh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/altanh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/altanh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/altanh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/altanh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/altanh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/altanh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/altanh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/altanh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/altanh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-30T01:35:24Z","updated_at":"2020-10-30T01:35:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"cc @antinucleon ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/719117205/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/719239288","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6779#issuecomment-719239288","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6779","id":719239288,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxOTIzOTI4OA==","user":{"login":"jroesch","id":696509,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjUwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/696509?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch","html_url":"https://github.com/jroesch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-30T06:00:37Z","updated_at":"2020-10-30T06:00:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"cc @tkonolige @mwillsey ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/719239288/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/719368757","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/6691#issuecomment-719368757","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6691","id":719368757,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxOTM2ODc1Nw==","user":{"login":"hzfan","id":18756967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NzU2OTY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18756967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan","html_url":"https://github.com/hzfan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-30T07:51:33Z","updated_at":"2020-10-30T07:51:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tqchen Yeah, sure.

I am also unsure if having Python be the source of truth is the right approach as well. \r\n\r\nI echo @tkonolige's concern.\r\n\r\nI think having a completely external format like LLVM's TableGen is conceptually simpler and more flexible as well. I feely strongly if we are going to generate code we should never check the generated files in, but by requiring Python it means to even build the C++ bindings I need to be able to run the generation step on my platform. I know there are some challenges running Python on more resource constrained devices does this pose build risks as well? cc @areusch \r\n\r\nHaving been one of the only people to bind 1000s of lines of TVM code all at once (in the implementation of the Rust bindings) I have found that structs are not the largest amount of work and the bigger challenge is actually method bindings per language. How do we handle these correctly in the Python set up? I feel like trying to cram them into the Python AST is awkward. \r\n\r\nEven writing a Rust macro for them is not ideal and Rust has significantly better and more flexible macro facilities. Even with the below \"raw\" bindings I had to do quite a bit of work to wrap them in an ergonomic API. We probably want to attach metadata to them which will be very hard to represent in Python, i.e method vs. function, per-language directives, etc. \r\n\r\nEven Google's ProtoBuf has this same problem and they provide a general annotation mechanism for passing information down to the code generation backends. \r\n\r\nSee below for example of binding the IRModule API.\r\n\r\n```\r\n#[repr(C)]\r\n#[derive(Object)]\r\n#[ref_name = \"IRModule\"]\r\n#[type_key = \"IRModule\"]\r\npub struct IRModuleNode {\r\n    pub base: Object,\r\n    pub functions: Map<GlobalVar, BaseFunc>,\r\n    pub type_definitions: Map<GlobalTypeVar, TypeData>,\r\n    pub source_map: SourceMap,\r\n    // TODO(@jroesch): this is missing some fields\r\n}\r\n\r\nexternal!

I'll work on the fix, that should enable removing the tuple flatting in the BYOC partitioning pass @manupa-arm  \r\n\r\n```\r\n#[version = \"0.0.5\"]\r\ndef @func0(%x: Tensor[(10, 10), uint8]) -> (Tensor[(5, 10), uint8], (Tensor[(5, 10), uint8], Tensor[(5, 10), uint8])) {\r\n  %0 = split(%x, indices_or_sections=2) /* ty=(Tensor[(5, 10), uint8], Tensor[(5, 10), uint8]) */;\r\n  %1 = %0.0;\r\n  %2 = %0.1;\r\n  %3 = %0.0;\r\n  %4 = abs(%3) /* ty=Tensor[(5, 10), uint8] */;\r\n  %5 = (%2, %4);\r\n  (%1, %5)\r\n}\r\n\r\ndef @main(%a: Tensor[(10, 10), uint8]) -> (Tensor[(5, 10), uint8], (Tensor[(5, 10), uint8], Tensor[(5, 10), uint8])) {\r\n  @func0(%a) /* ty=(Tensor[(5, 10), uint8], (Tensor[(5, 10), uint8], Tensor[(5, 10), uint8])) */\r\n}\r\n``` \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n>  I've been looking at the compile_engine recently and noticed a number of TODOs there with the comment 'Allow recursive tuple'\r\n\r\nThose TODOs look unrelated to graph memory planning.

So the main goal of the schema serves as a way to facilitate the data layout generation, while still allowing users to fill out the necessary content(e.g. member functions) in the corresponding backend language. \r\n\r\nThat means the schema is an auxiliary tool that developer can run, but the generated code is always checked in and generation step is not invoked part of the build (like clang-format), resulting lightweight commitment and transition from developers (no need to use in day 0 for all classes). \r\n\r\nThe challenges in handling backend methods and other language specific variantions is exactly the reason why I think in this case partial fill up and checking-in the code makes sense. Because the schema generator can focus on generate things it is certain about and good at (the data layout), while allowing direct use of the backend language to add other parts(e.g. methods) without having to come up with a language for methods(that is never going to be perfect).\r\n\r\nThe layout information alone is very useful for cross language enablement, like rust access binding etc and build code generators for accessing the data structure. \r\n\r\nGiven that first class python support is one of our design goal, and as we start to evolve TVMScript I think we want to think about the possibility of supporting custom ADT as part of the type system and input. I do think it makes sense to have a python frontend to the schema itself, which provides convenience to specify the data layout.\r\n\r\nNotably, the current schema approach enables for a gradual adoption: generate necessary parts for data layout. While still acknowledging that method binding per language is hard to solve, and allow manual customization in the bakcend language itself.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/720692796/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/720723262","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6703#issuecomment-720723262","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6703","id":720723262,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyMDcyMzI2Mg==","user":{"login":"areusch","id":532957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/532957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch","html_url":"https://github.com/areusch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-02T21:03:51Z","updated_at":"2020-11-02T21:03:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@leandron @u99127 @manupa-arm please take a look when you have a minute and explicitly approve if you're good w/ this change","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/720723262/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/720740351","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6809#issuecomment-720740351","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6809","id":720740351,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyMDc0MDM1MQ==","user":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-02T21:40:57Z","updated_at":"2020-11-02T21:40:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@tqchen @zhiics @jroesch @mbaret Supporting nested tuples in `CallNode->op` return type required making non trivial changes to multiple files in the commit https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/pull/6809/commits/d384062f4e2c38755cb9ae190d218d366cec906f\r\n\r\nMaybe it would help BYOC use cases, but otherwise I don't know if we want to support this in practice.
