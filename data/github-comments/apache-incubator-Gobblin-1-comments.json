There's an easier way to get the MR job working directory. Do the following in MRJobLauncher:\n\n```\nGobblinOutputFormat.setOutputPath(mrJobDir);\n```\n\nThen in the OutputCommitter, you can get the path using:\n\n```\nPath mrJobDir = new Path(GobblinOutputFormat.getOutputPath(context).toUri.getPath());\n```\n\nI also think we should put the writer staging and output directories to under the MR working directory by default, and only allow users to specify the data publisher output directory.
