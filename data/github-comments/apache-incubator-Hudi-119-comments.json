Thank you for getting back to me. I've created a [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-1807) for the `NoSuchElementException` issue and will work on it. \r\nAs for the incremental pulling concern, as the document says:\r\n```\r\nProperty: hoodie.datasource.read.begin.instanttime, [Required in incremental mode] \r\nInstant time to start incrementally pulling data from. \r\nThe instanttime here need not necessarily correspond to an instant on the timeline. \r\nNew data written with an instant_time > BEGIN_INSTANTTIME are fetched out. \r\nFor e.g: ‘20170901080000’ will get all new data written after Sep 1, 2017 08:00AM.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe it clearly states `The instanttime here need not necessarily correspond to an instant on the timeline`. It contradicts the behaviour I had observed in my experiment where I fed it an instant time in the past, but it only fetched partial updates for me; updates to `199` was _missing_.\r\n\r\nSomething wasn't _correct_, either we had a discrepancy between our actual implementation and the way we present it in the document or the other way around that our existing archiving and timeline mechanism affects the integrity of our incremental query to some extend. I need a thorough understanding to make a judgemental call regarding whether we should fetch updates happening among the archived timeline since clearly it introduces overhead and may affect other things.

@ssdong , pulling from the active timeline only was the expected behavior. We can improve the documentation to clarify this. Archive the instants constantly are in order to avoid bulky active timeline, if we pull the instants from the archived timeline in every query, we lost the point to separate them. What I recommend is to tune the configuration that controls how many instants to store in the active timeline. Or we can create another config to control whether pulling from the archived timeline or not.

Yep, I was trying to confirm the “expected” behavior of incremental query. It makes sense to pull from _existing_ active timeline, given a bulky active timeline would introduce a file listing issue and so we do archiving. Controlling the number of instants on the active timeline through `keep.max` is definitely one way to go. Adding extra configuration(default to be `false`) so we could tune it to pull from the archived timeline doesn’t sound bad to me, though we should carefully document it and educate our users on it. Ideally, the option to read from archived timeline applies to the case where there aren't that many archived commit files otherwise we'll face the same bulky timeline again, and an alternative in this case, depending on the number of generated file groups and slices, is to ask the user to read _all_ existing files and do select on it. However, if the underlying storage system allows log appending, we wouldn't end up having many archive files as they will be merged to previously archived files. Unfortunately, mainstream storage like S3 does not allow appending. (CMIIW) 😅 \r\nConclusion: I guess if we implement the configuration and well document it, it should be good. Let me know. Thanks!
