You can get around this by storing state in 'aux_params' however.\n\n@paipai880429 assuming you are still interested in a solution, here's one way to go about it:\n1. In python/mxnet/model.py:fit(...) add argument for early-stopping (perhaps with a default value, e.g. something like 'early_stopping_epochs = 10').\n2. Within \"fit()\" function, pass this early-stopping variable to sub-function '_train_multi_device' and update the header for '_train_multi_device' to accept it (like step 1).\n3. Within '_train_multi_device', search for 'eval_metric.get()' used on the evaluation set. Use this value and the early-stopping value to implement the logic to figure out when to stop.
