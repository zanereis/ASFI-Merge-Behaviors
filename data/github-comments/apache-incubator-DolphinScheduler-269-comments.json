By lease and keepalive, we can make sure the key will exist when the client disconnect, the lease will delete.\r\n### Subscribe/Notify\r\nThere is a watchClient in etcd to monitor changes to keys. When a watch response coming,the listener will notify.\r\n### Lock\r\nEtcd Lock uses a lease on a key which is revoked when the lock is reased.If the server the lock is running on dies, or the network is disconnected, etcd will time out the lock.\r\n### ConnectionStateListener\r\nWe get Client's shared channel by reflect, becase all fields is private on jetcd.\r\nThere will be a scheduler thread, if the channel state has changed, then is will trigger the connection
