It can only return a process-local task.\n- If this didn't return a task, call resourceOffers with NODE_LOCAL. It can return a node-local task.\n- If this didn't return a task, call resourceOffers with NO_PREFS. This will always return a no-pref task, without doing any kind of delay scheduling, but it also doesn't update the \"last locality level\" variable or anything like that.\n\nThis is different from what you mentioned above because there's no 3 second wait. If your TaskSet has only process-local and no-prefs tasks, it will greedily launch all the process-local ones, then immediately launch all the no-prefs ones.\n\nI guess one case this doesn't cover is if the TaskSet has some tasks that are process-local, some that are node-local, and some that are no-prefs. Then it will launch the no-prefs ones before node-local during the 3 seconds where it's waiting for node-local. I think this case is pretty uncommon, but if we do want to fix it, probably the best way is to make resourceOffers on NO_PREFS check if NODE_LOCAL is in myLocalityLevels, and if so, wait until its delay has passed too.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50294011/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50295014","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/940#issuecomment-50295014","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/940","id":50295014,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMjk1MDE0","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-28T02:29:27Z","updated_at":"2014-07-28T02:29:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA

There is one issue in this right now, which is that if your map task spills to disk, you need to spill multiple times with the sort-based shuffle, whereas with the old code you would directly open one file for each reduce task and write data to it. I think we can add the same behavior here if the # of reduce tasks is small enough (the problem before was that you'd open 10,000 files for 10,000 reduce tasks and allocate lots of space for buffers, not to mention do lots of random I/O). I would do that in a separate pull request though. For other things, like reduceByKey, this should have similar performance to the hash-based

@miccagiann,\n\nUntil it's merged, this pull request will be automatically updated to contain any commits added to the branch that you opened it from.  It looks like you've opened this PR from the master branch of your repository and accidentally included some unwanted commits.  I'd recommend closing this pull request, creating a new topic branch in your repository that contains only the commits that you want to be included in the pull request, and opening a new pull request based off that branch (you might find GitHub's [\"Using pull requests\"](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) guide to be helpful).\n\nI like to keep my `master` branch in sync with the `apache/spark` repository and do my work in topic branches based off of it.  To migrate from your current repository state to this workflow, I'd try doing something like this:\n\n``` bash\ngit fetch apache  # Fetch the latest commits from the upstream Spark repo\n                  # (might be named something other than 'apache')\ngit checkout master\ngit checkout -b old-master  # Create a new branch pointing to the current master, so we don't lose those commits.\ngit checkout master  # Switch back to your master branch\ngit reset --hard apache/master  # Force-reset your master branch to match the apache master branch\ngit checkout -b my-feature-branch  # Create a new branch to develop your pull request in\n```\n\nNow you should be on `my-feature-branch`.  Normally, you'd make commits against this feature branch, but in this case we want to grab some of the commits from your old master branch and apply them here.  You can do that with `cherry-pick`:\n\n``` bash\ngit log old-master  # List the commits in your old branch\ngit cherry-pick sha-of-commit-you-want\n```\n\nNow, `my-feature-branch` should be in a good state, containing only the commits you want, and you should be able to push it to GitHub and open a new PR.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50299937/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50300190","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1313#issuecomment-50300190","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1313","id":50300190,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMzAwMTkw","user":{"login":"mateiz","id":228859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODg1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz","html_url":"https://github.com/mateiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-28T04:53:31Z","updated_at":"2014-07-28T04:53:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I see, in that case, maybe you can remember a Boolean the first time you saw your tasks to see whether some of them had hostnames specified but not executors.

I would like to dig a little deeper into understanding the specific issues you found, in order to understand the solutions you have provided (since the specific solutions seem interleaved with a lot of new asserts and code paths). \n\nYou mention that there was an issue if shuffle writes co-occur with shuffle fetches, which is true, but should not typically occur due to the barrier before the reduce stage of a shuffle. In what situations does this happen (outside of failure conditions)?\n\nDid you observe a prior pattern of close/revert/close on the same block writer?\n\nHow did task failures induce inconsistent state on the map side? Was it due to the same close/revert/close pattern?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50305416/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50306070","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1609#issuecomment-50306070","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1609","id":50306070,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMzA2MDcw","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-28T07:03:50Z","updated_at":"2014-07-28T07:03:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA tests have started for PR 1609.

I did not understand the space issue : stylecheck seems to run fine.\n\nRegarding the actual problems : the JIRA lists some of them - maybe it is not exhaustive since I did not go over each condition where it currently fails, and this fixes it.\nAt a high level, Spark code assumes a few things :\n1) A flush followed by close should not cause additional data to be written to the stream - which is not valid in general case (close can still write more data).\n2) reading an object from stream will consume all data written as  part of the object - which is not valid in general case, additional info could have been written after the object was written (like reset markers in java serde). So stream wrapping has to account for that.\n3) You can have interleaving of map and reduce stages - even if there are no task failures when you have speculative execution : current node might be continuing to run an earlier task, while cluster has moved on to reduce.\n4) You have more involved cases where a map task was tried on a node, and its result was not used since someother node finished it first (speculative exec) - and subsequent failure of that other node could reschedule the same task on this node again. Which is why \"numBlocks\" became an Int in ShuffleBlockManager and associated changes.\n5) Not all the asserts are to validate the new code : lot of it is to validate constraints of existing code :-)\nThe changes are not as extensive as they might appear !\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50306633/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50306648","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1609#issuecomment-50306648","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1609","id":50306648,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMzA2NjQ4","user":{"login":"mridulm","id":1591700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTE3MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1591700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm","html_url":"https://github.com/mridulm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-28T07:13:39Z","updated_at":"2014-07-28T07:13:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Accidental close, apologies !\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50306648/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50307155","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1609#issuecomment-50307155","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1609","id":50307155,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMzA3MTU1","user":{"login":"mridulm","id":1591700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTE3MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1591700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm","html_url":"https://github.com/mridulm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-28T07:22:06Z","updated_at":"2014-07-28T07:22:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Jenkins, test this please\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50307155/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50307247","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1609#issuecomment-50307247","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1609","id":50307247,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMzA3MjQ3","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-28T07:23:37Z","updated_at":"2014-07-28T07:23:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA tests have started for PR 1609.

My general policy is to cut a release whenever someone asks (or within a couple of weeks of that). We've done a bunch of refactoring to the algebraic hierarchy and a few other biggish things, so I might be a bit more cautious than usual. There are also some features I'd like to see in a 0.9 that will take some time, but if you need a release I can cause one to appear.\n\nquasiquotes is a compile time thing and you can probably exclude it from your dependencies without a problem. I'm not quite sure how they got in there.\n\nFor Commons Math: We mostly use the LP solver, some numerics routines, random number generation, and some probability distributions.

AmplabJenkins is not a person, it's the Jenkins bot. It would blow my mind if he answered!)\n\nJosh gives everything you need to know there to fix your setup. By the way, the command to update your `miccagiann/master` to match `apache/master` is `git pull --rebase apache master` (replace `apache` with what you've called the upstream remote) and `git push origin master`.

If not, we should probably give it a more specific name, such as `unpersistAllRdds()`.\n\nWhat do you think is the typical use-case for wanting to unpersist all state while retaining RDD lineage, etc?  I imagine that a Spark Job Server that runs multiple jobs using the same context might want to unpersist _portions_ of its state as jobs finish, but bulk-unpersisting all state might be a bad approach here since it could impact the performance of other jobs.\n\nIt seems like this job-server use-case could be addressed by a mechanism similar to region-based memory management in which unpersist-able objects are created in some persistence context, persistence contexts can be nested, and an entire persistence content's resources can be freed at once.  This captures `unpersistAll()` as a special case in which every object is allocated as part of the root persistence context.  Individual jobs could have their own persistence contexts, allowing users to unpersist only the new broadcast variables / RDDs associated with a particular job / unit of work. \n\nThis \"persistence context\" approach might be over-engineered, but I think it would be helpful to come up with a small set of real use-cases where batch unpersistence is needed to see whether `unpersistAll()` adequately addresses them.  `unpersist()` is essentially manual memory management, so maybe we can borrow patterns from there, too.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50360869/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50363114","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1313#issuecomment-50363114","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1313","id":50363114,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMzYzMTE0","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-28T16:36:14Z","updated_at":"2014-07-28T16:36:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA results for PR 1313:<br>\\- This patch PASSES unit tests.<br>\\- This patch merges cleanly<br>\\- This patch adds no public classes<br><br>For more information see test ouptut:<br>https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/SparkPullRequestBuilder/17282/consoleFull\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50363114/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50363390","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1609#issuecomment-50363390","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1609","id":50363390,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMzYzMzkw","user":{"login":"aarondav","id":1400247,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDAyNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1400247?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav","html_url":"https://github.com/aarondav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-28T16:38:23Z","updated_at":"2014-07-28T16:38:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mridulm Thanks for the clarifications!

If the app name is very long and we decide to add more fields in the future, we may hit a different limitation of the file system, i.e. the length of the file name. I think what we want to do instead is have two files, (1) the event log and (2) the metadata, instead of trying to encode all the information in the file names (as we have done even before your PR).\n\nThe other thing is that I notice you pass a lot of `null`s around. It would be good if you could avoid these when initializing variables or returning from methods, either through Options or other more concise ways of rewriting the logic.\n\nAlso, if you could up-merge this once you have a chance that would be great.

The `commons-math3` problem is not which version to use but how to match the version hadoop depends on. We can switch to 3.1.1 to match hadoop 2.3/2.4 for now. But if hadoop upgrades to 3.2 or 3.3 in the future, we still have version conflicts unless we maintain a version mapping in our build or shade commons-math3. I tried to downgrade `commons-math3` to 3.1.1 in breeze and found two missing in 3.1.1: `Erf` and `LevyDistribution`.\n\nmllib uses `LBFGS` from breeze, which depends on `FirstOrderMinimizer`. But it doesn't touch `RandBasis`. I'll check whether it is safe to exclude `commons-math3` in mllib. If it is, we should probably do that.\n\n@marmbrus Thanks! Then it should be safe to exclude `quasiquotes`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50379548/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50379727","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/993#issuecomment-50379727","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/993","id":50379727,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMzc5NzI3","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-28T18:38:48Z","updated_at":"2014-07-28T18:38:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA tests have started for PR 993.
