I totally agree! \n\nPoint 1 - We use codahale metrics everywhere in our company's applications, and it is a really nice library. In terms of druid, it would cover both the metric collection in the service, and then expose the Reporter interface which we might still end up implementing for each store (if they don't exist already). I could imagine this being a similar amount of code to a new Emitter.  It would also kind of require rethinking how metrics are actually named (i.e. MetricName + combination of dimensions). You definitely don't want to end up storing a Metric in memory for each dimension combination....\n\nPoint 4 - I definitely felt this as I was defining the mapping.  I did my best to make sure that every type is correct for the metric, but I may have made mistakes. While working on this, it occurred to me that this type information could be part of the Druid metric interface...\n\nPoint 6 - Makes sense, that's more convenient.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/215777882/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/215799110","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/2656#issuecomment-215799110","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2656","id":215799110,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNTc5OTExMA==","user":{"login":"himanshug","id":246308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjMwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug","html_url":"https://github.com/himanshug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-29T16:38:29Z","updated_at":"2016-04-29T16:38:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@gianm

was wondering about what the TimeAndDims Spec means and what it is used for. I was glad to see this pull request. Now that I know that TimeAndDims is to be used for Protobuf and Avro, I looked into the sources but did not see a reference to TimeAndDims in the Avro code (AvroStreamInputRowParser, AvroHadoopInputRowParser). We currently have set the parseSpec to \"json\" and are ingesting avro records with this setting and we don't observe any strange behaviour. So it would be great if one could add an explanation of what the rationale behind having the different parseSpec-types (TimeAndDims, json, text) is.\nFurthermore, some code and doc samples feature these name tokens to be set for an element named \"type\" whereas sometimes the element name is

`format` is correct, we'll update the docs.\n\nThe reason for having both format-less `timeAndDims` and also actual formats like json, tsv is that the ParseSpec class is kind of overloaded to do two things. It provides a time and dimension spec (all parsers use this) and it also provides a formatter for the string parser (json/csv/tsv – only the string parser uses this).\n\nIt's okay to use one of the stringy parseSpecs like json/csv/tsv with a non-string parser, since the stringy parts will be ignored.
