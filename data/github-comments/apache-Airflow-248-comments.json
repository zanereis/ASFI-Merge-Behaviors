In this case Yamllint is run via yamlint python pre-commit plugin. Those plugins (which are python-based) manage their dependencies and virtualenvs on their own. Basically those built-in plugins create their own small virtualenv where they install needed dependencies (yamllint in this case) using `pip install .` and run the plugin within that virtualenv. It's all done automagically by the pre-commit framework - without docker. This works for simple stand-alone plugins like yamllint where you have  just one or two dependencies that are system-independent and can rely on virtualenv.

for the Travis build we also save time on downloading the image.

My vote would be to change the flag to schedule_at_interval_start and default it to false for now as scheduling_at_interval_start is the more intuitive behavior. What are people's feelings on changing the default execution to schedule interval start and communicating this to existing users in the Updating notes so that they can preserve the old behavior? Could potentially cause headaches for users who don't read the notes but I think it might make sense to bite the bullet at some point for more intuitive behavior overall for new users.\r\n\r\nI haven't looked that carefully, but I think there are potentially a lot more places in the code that need to be changed that use dag.following_schedule(), e.g. latest_only_operator, cli.py. In fact it might make more sense to make the change in the following_schedule function itself. There are also functions previous_schedule that might need to be modified too.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/524338027/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/524404937","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5887#issuecomment-524404937","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5887","id":524404937,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNDQwNDkzNw==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-23T17:51:32Z","updated_at":"2019-08-23T17:51:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"ping.
