If we wanted separate artboard mappings, it's not clear what they would be named. For example:\r\n* There are both hollow (![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/360fc65b-48b1-4905-a13a-b6076ab6cf93)) and non-hollow (![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c706aa0-3451-4215-af00-1db2b90227a9)) PNG icons called \"initializerStatic.png\".\r\n* A non-hollow PNG icon (![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1c68d0c-07b7-4c84-b838-9aa933c4ad9e)) exists both with the name \"constructorPublic.png\" and \"initializer.png\".\r\n\r\nI think there might at some point have been an intention to distinguish constructors and initializers, but it was not done consistently. And it may not have mattered in the end, since e.g. the Navigator does not seem to show an entry for initializers.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2571412763/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2571414971","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/8083#issuecomment-2571414971","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/8083","id":2571414971,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6ZRK27","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-04T21:22:04Z","updated_at":"2025-01-04T21:22:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sorry, I did not notice the existing inconsistency.

Since having extra buttons as part of the tree, a toolbar or part of the tab implementation are three different stories. This will also decide _where_ they should show up, since \"Projects\" is not the only component with a tree.\r\n\r\nThe next question would be _what else_ could be added to that component in future - this might also influence how it is implemented and where to put it.\r\n\r\nUI changes are never as easy as they seem, esp not in a core component of a 20+ year old IDE. The last trivial-looking contribution we merged will probably take 1-2 releases to stabilize. The committer which ends up merging this feature should also be willing to do that, since I am still busy thinking about how to fix the fallout of the last contribution :P\r\n\r\nMy personal opinion is that a toolbar on the bottom (or moveable), analog to navigator is still a very flexible contender since:\r\n - the feature is already there (easier to implement + UI consistency perspective + self explanatory)\r\n - can be minimized out of the box (since the first question after release of this feature will be \"how to turn it off\")\r\n - is very flexible and has space, e.g \r\n   - Favorites view could have the \"Add to Favorites...\" action on it\r\n   - buttons for project group management could be nice on the \"Projects\" view\r\n   - \"synchronize editor with views\" toggle could also move there on the main 3 views\r\n - if it turns out that the toolbar is not cool enough, some actions could be still moved into something else later\r\n - (someone once said that the main purpose of toolbars is to discover features and their hotkeys via tooltips without having to read the doc)\r\n\r\nFor me personally I like the proposal to move it to the tab component the least, since it will likely end up being the most difficult implementation and it is the spot with the smallest amount of space (I have no room left so i would likely end up turning it off anyway). The button count will also change when switching between views which might look weird/cause other problems.

The protocol by default uses path, and this code apparently does not change the default, i.e. what goes over the wire is a path. (And to make things work, both client and server must see the same file using the same path.) What `URLPathConvertor` used to do, and what `URIPathConvertor` is doing now, is the translation between what the IDE uses internally (which used to be a String-encoded URL before, and is a `java.net.URI` now) to what the wire protocol expects (i.e. a path). The protocol side was not changed at all, only the IDE side.\r\n\r\nThe main point of the `URIPathConvertor` is to leave the door half-open to provide a different conversion (e.g. when both the sources and the debugger server would be remote), I don't see why it would need to be solved now - the current code should work for local paths (at least for local paths on UNIX systems). When there's a need to make things work for remote stuff, we can do whatever tweaks are necessary.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2571677531/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2571677758","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/7976#issuecomment-2571677758","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7976","id":2571677758,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6ZSLA-","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-05T16:18:39Z","updated_at":"2025-01-05T16:18:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"good catch, not sure where this was from.

Regarding whether all of these are necessary: yes, they are. The Kubernetes API is complex, and implementing all the required calls at the REST level is beyond the scope of a single developer.\r\nI also hope that either I or another community member will use Fabric8 for additional Kubernetes integrations (not specific to any cloud provider). There are numerous potential features, such as deploying applications or starting a remote debug session.\r\nAs for OCI, I am not aware of any other cloud provider planning to add support for its infrastructure. If that happens, it would be better to find a way to share a single code base rather than creating a separate fork for each new provider. Directly binding a subset of structures with Jackson might be possible, but it would significantly increase development effort and maintenance complexity.

One think I'm still fuzzy about is the story about breakpoints (concrete `BreakpointConvertor`) what is its role here?\r\n\r\nTo my knowledge: in the NetBeans API, every mime type (language) needs to provide its own breakpoint implementations. And there can be only sensibly one breakpoint implementation for each language (technically, we can have multiple breakpoint implementations, I think, but the UI for that would not be sensible). So while this PR adds a \"generic\" implementation of breakpoints that can be used for languages that don't provide other breakpoint implementations, this generic implementation cannot (to my knowledge) be used for the languages that already provide breakpoint implementations, like Java, C/C++, PHP or JavaScript.\r\n\r\nBut, it may still be sensible to permit the use of the DAP debugger even for these languages in some cases. Hence the convertor - it can provide data from language-specific breakpoints to the DAP debugger, so that the DAP debugger can use them.\r\n\r\nThat's my understanding at least.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, we have breakpoints for Java, C/C++, PHP, JavaScript, and possibly other languages.

Regarding whether all of these are necessary: yes, they are. The Kubernetes API is complex, and implementing all the required calls at the REST level is beyond the scope of a single developer.\r\n\r\n@jhorvath Agreed, proposals which would try to generate or re-implement the k8 model would pretty much guarantee a veto from me since this would be both unmaintainable and also not observable given the API footprint. Using the dependency is the lesser evil there but I would rather try to find ways to avoid this situation entirely.\r\n\r\nNetBeans was always known for good tooling integration - do doubt. However, this can often also be achieved by integrating with the project build or tools in the environment. A project will likely know how to deploy itself to a cluster since nobody deploys IDEs to CI. NB already bundles maven and gradle which could delegate to plugins. Maybe it can call the cli tool. Delegating to projects, if possible, is often the ideal solution since they know exactly [what versions they have to work with](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/java/wiki/2.-Versioning-and-Compatibility#compatibility).\r\n\r\n@sdedic @jhorvath Regarding the dependencies specifically. We do know that there is no dependabot and nothing what makes dependency updates a one-click operation in this repo. By integrating this, there is also the shared responsibility (esp from those who approved and merged) to keep those dependencies up to date before releases. We have a manually triggered [dep checker workflow](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/actions/workflows/dependency-checks.yml), but thats where the convenience ends unfortunately.\r\n\r\n@matthiasblaesing already mentioned it, but this does also add yet another http client which is not ideal from the attack surface perspective. Please check if there is a java.net.http variant, if not, please have especially an eye on that dependency between releases.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2579537777/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2580160360","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/7101#issuecomment-2580160360","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7101","id":2580160360,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6Zyh9o","user":{"login":"IngeAida","id":129903489,"node_id":"U_kgDOB74rgQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/129903489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/IngeAida","html_url":"https://github.com/IngeAida","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IngeAida/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IngeAida/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IngeAida/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IngeAida/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IngeAida/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IngeAida/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IngeAida/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IngeAida/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IngeAida/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-09T13:30:32Z","updated_at":"2025-01-09T13:30:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"En el paquete en netbeans está desabilitado la opción copiar y pegar por lo tanto no puedo agregar imágenes en mi proyecto, alguien me puede ayudar","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2580160360/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2580757534","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/8130#issuecomment-2580757534","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/8130","id":2580757534,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6Z0zwe","user":{"login":"neilcsmith-net","id":3975960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3975960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net","html_url":"https://github.com/neilcsmith-net","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-09T16:34:26Z","updated_at":"2025-01-09T16:34:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I'm not sure I understand the request here.

Oracle Cloud SDK is here since January 2022 and was properly reviewed by @matthiasblaesing  and @JaroslavTulach before it was merged into master. For reference, see PR #3352.\r\nRegarding the recent addition of the Fabric8 library, my decision was based on extensive testing. Compared to the CLI, Fabric8 is approximately 100 times faster and significantly more reliable, particularly for operations like port forwarding. While Gradle and Maven plugins are well-suited for CI/CD, they don’t provide the seamless, quick deployment experience that developers expect when deploying directly from an IDE. Fabric8 excels in this scenario, delivering a smoother and more efficient user experience. It has also lower number of transitive dependencies than the official Kubernetes Java Client. The only drawback is that it doesn't support a java.net.http clients. \r\nAs for dependency management, I understand the concerns. When adding the OCI SDK, I saw the mess firsthand and cleaned up several duplicate libraries during the process.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2583167575/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2583324253","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/8128#issuecomment-2583324253","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/8128","id":2583324253,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6Z-mZd","user":{"login":"ebarboni","id":6940099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDAwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6940099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni","html_url":"https://github.com/ebarboni","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-10T17:33:29Z","updated_at":"2025-01-10T17:33:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"the release240 use jdk17 to build and because of the change in template do disableindoc [javadoc] error: invalid flag: --disable-line-doc-comments error is triggered \r\nthe master build is using the jdk 23 so it works.\r\n\r\non releasexxx we use the lowest jdk because javadoc jar was not openable with jdk using lower version maybe it's possible to alter that.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2583324253/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2583331684","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/8128#issuecomment-2583331684","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/8128","id":2583331684,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6Z-oNk","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-10T17:38:11Z","updated_at":"2025-01-10T22:23:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"the reason we used JDK 23 in the first place is due to issues with nb-javac since it is based on the most recent JDK [INFRA-26219](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-26219).\r\n\r\nNB is full with instances of `///` which were never intended to be javadoc.
