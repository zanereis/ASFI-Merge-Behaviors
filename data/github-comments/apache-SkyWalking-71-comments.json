And this fits most of scenarios in Java codes. But in vertx(react style), things changed.\r\nYour case is very typical. \r\n\r\nThread accept the request, then\r\n1. Create span, meaning, create a segment.\r\n1. Try to assign the work to another thread\r\n1. Right now, the thread still holds the segment/tracingcontext in thread local.\r\n\r\nThat is why if we don't finish that, the new incoming request uses the existing trace context, which triggers your issue at the beginning.\r\n\r\nBut we finish the span, then because tracing context is a stack-based structure, right? The tracing context finished, and segment finished too. So at this moment, the thread local is available for new request. That is why you traces look like working well in concurrency requests.\r\n\r\nThe side-effect of doing this, is segment finished when your work assignment is finished, not works are done because that is in another thread, right? \r\n\r\nSkyWalking backend analysis the response time based on segment and entry span, that is why you can't see 4s(in your case) here, but you can see 4s in trace visualization. The trace visualization shows 4s because UI did that. \r\n\r\nSkyWalking analysis 100% trust the entry span and segment, that is why we are high performance and don't need distributed cache in any case. So when request entry span says ~0s duration, the endpoint metric show in the same way.\r\n\r\n--------\r\nI am proposal the complex tracing context implementation is \r\n1. `TracingContext` and `Segment` could go across threads in Java\r\n1.

You're saying the JSON trace stack I included above is correct in all aspects except for the `endTime` on the `ExitSpan` and `EntrySpan`? And it's because of the fact that the `EntrySpan` has an incorrect `endTime` that the response time shows up as it does in the UI?

Each span is dealt with individually. If I open a span I have to make sure to close it. If that happens then by the time the response is ready the active span will be the correct span to close.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, there isn't about you need to know the parent span. It is more about when tracing context could **finish** automatically and in the right time. In SkyWalking design and its API, you could notice that we don't have an API called `TracingContext#finished` from any plugin, just inside TracingContext triggered automatically, **WHY?**, because no plugin knows he is the last/first span. \r\n\r\nIn codes level, read `TracingContext#activeSpanStack` and `EntrySpan`(also its parent `StackBasedTracingSpan`), you will find out the span finish operation need to do in the exact same order as open it. Also `TracingContext` is in the `ThreadLocal`, which ones, one thread could only have one TracingContext.\r\n\r\nBased on this background, how do you `don't finish the entry span` but switch the `TracingContext` to another request? \r\n\r\nSo, things like `EntrySpan is retrieved` only could happen when tracing context doesn't finish even all spans finished(removed from the active stack). That is key I mean for new `TracingContext` implementation, hold the context and span, make you have the chance to change/adjust the span.\r\n\r\nDoes this make more sense to you now? \r\n\r\nThis is a very complex scenario. Argue and the trade-off between development convenient and API capabilities. Most tracing systems ignore this to do based on Dapper paper says, so backend will face heavy payload. But they, like Zipkin and Jaeger, are not APM solution, so this doesn't matter for them.

First open the local span, then close the entry span via asyncFinish then close the local span?\r\n\r\nFrom the trace, you should be using APIs in the right way. The other steps are about, you should create new context(including local span) in another thread(callback) in case there is other further plugin working. \r\n\r\nSuch as in your codes\r\n```java\r\n    private void callGetProduct() {\r\n        HttpClient httpClient = vertx.createHttpClient();\r\n        httpClient.getNow(8080, \"localhost\", \"/products/test\",\r\n                new Handler<HttpClientResponse>() {\r\n\r\n                    @Override\r\n                    public void handle(HttpClientResponse httpClientResponse) {\r\n                        /////////////////////////////\r\n                        // Add more real codes here,\r\n                        // including call another RPC or access Database\r\n                        /////////////////////////////\r\n                    }\r\n        \r\n```\r\n\r\nYou would like the trace could continue in `#handle` method, right? If you don't create new context in handle thread, the trace will break, because async span doesn't include the capability to propagate context. Async span is just for making sure duration/tag/log/etc. fields right/accurate.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/473480344/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/473480457","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/2341#issuecomment-473480457","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/2341","id":473480457,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MzQ4MDQ1Nw==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-16T00:30:11Z","updated_at":"2019-03-16T00:30:11Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I am glad we are almost done:)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/473480457/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/473480693","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/2353#issuecomment-473480693","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/2353","id":473480693,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MzQ4MDY5Mw==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-16T00:32:10Z","updated_at":"2019-03-16T00:32:10Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@ascrutae What is the status of the test case PR for this?

both and they both work and seem to produce the same traces.\r\n\r\nThe way I have it currently coded for the callback method is:\r\n```java\r\n@Override\r\npublic void beforeMethod(EnhancedInstance

context.getSpan().asyncFinish();\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Override\r\npublic Object afterMethod(EnhancedInstance objInst, Method method, Object[] allArguments, Class<?>[] argumentsTypes,\r\n                          Object ret) throws Throwable {\r\n    ContextManager.stopSpan();\r\n    return ret;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above code is the interceptor for the method:\r\n```java\r\n@Override\r\npublic void handle(HttpClientResponse httpClientResponse) {\r\n    /////////////////////////////\r\n    // Add more real codes here,\r\n    // including call another RPC or access Database\r\n
