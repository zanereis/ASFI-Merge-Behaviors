Plus using `Keys` and `Values` in the names should hopefully relate them to `collectEntries` since entries are just keys and values. I think I prefer those names to Kotlin's `With` and `By` suffixes and Guava's `uniqueIndex` and `toMap`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/1360225048/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/1360651016","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/1835#issuecomment-1360651016","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/1835","id":1360651016,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAgdnis5RGeMI","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-21T01:36:13Z","updated_at":"2022-12-21T01:37:44Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#

Take `find` and `findAll` for instance, they have the no Closure variants:\r\n```\r\nvar list = [null, '', 'A', null, 'B']\r\nassert list.findAll() == ['A', 'B']\r\nassert list.find() == 'A'\r\n```\r\nThese return all (or the first) element that satisfies Groovy truth. It is common in Groovy to provide these shortcuts even though `findAll { it }` and `find { it }` would do in the above examples. The same applies for `groupBy`, `collect`, `collectEntries`, and others. We have never gotten around to providing the findResult/s variants which is what this PR does. It improves Groovy's consistency in the API.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/1368316519/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/1368483874","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/1839#issuecomment-1368483874","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/1839","id":1368483874,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAgdnis5RkWgi","user":{"login":"eric-milles","id":18193802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTkzODAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18193802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-milles","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-milles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-milles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-milles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-milles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-milles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-milles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-milles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-milles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-milles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-milles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-01T16:46:23Z","updated_at":"2023-01-01T16:48:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I don't think it is hole in existing functionality though.
