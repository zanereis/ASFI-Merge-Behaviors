You can download http://archive.apache.org/dist/hadoop/core/hadoop-0.21.0/hadoop-0.21.0.tar.gz and check for yourself in common/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/fs/FSDataOutputStream.java.\n\nI also verified that hadoop 1.0.4 does **not** have hflush (although, amusingly enough, it does have references to hflush in the code and documentation... from patches that were cherry-picked from other branches, presumably.)  Instead, it has an implementation of hflush (I think?) inside the sync function.\n\nLooking at the \"Hadoop genealogy\" reveals how this could have happened: http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GO6HF0OAFHw/UOfNEH-4sEI/AAAAAAAAAD0/dEWFFYTRgYw/s1600/output-file.png\n\nIt looks like what happened was that the hadoop 0.20 line kind of diverged from the hadoop 0.21 line.  The 1.0.4 release somehow came out of the 0.20 line, while the 0.21 line mutated into hadoop 2.x at some point.  This was all before my time... even CDH3 had hflush, which is the oldest version of Hadoop I ever worked on.\n\nSounds like we're back to reflection tricks, then.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/44368192/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/44368584","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/714#issuecomment-44368584","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/714","id":44368584,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MzY4NTg0","user":{"login":"pwendell","id":320616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDYxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/320616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell","html_url":"https://github.com/pwendell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-28T05:59:37Z","updated_at":"2014-05-28T05:59:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Suggested

And to have the default KryoRegistrator register all the classes in this property.  So the user/library-facing API could be KryoSerializer.registerClasses(SparkConf, Array[Class[_]]), which would append to this property.\n\nThough would there be a good location for a library to call that API?  Alternatively, libraries could expose a getClassesToRegister API.  So if I'm using MLLib and GraphX, I call KryoSerializer.configure(conf, Arrays.concatenate(myClasses, MLLibKryo.getClassesToRegister, GraphXKryo.getClassesToRegister)).

That, plus the fact that this fixes the trunk (hadoop 3.0.0) build, is probably a good enough reason to do this, even if we didn't care about the deprecation issues.  If we don't have this in Spark 1.0, it's just not going to work against CDH 5.1.0.\n\nAlso, all the YARN people I talked to were upset that we were using YarnClientImpl-- that class is not supposed to be used by outsiders at all...  it would be private, but we have the old \"we want to put things from a single project in multiple java packages\" issue.\n\nI still have not managed to figured out why this change is required to get cdh5.1.0 going.  I was pursuing a theory today that turned out to be wrong.  I also verified that both Hadoop 2.4 and a pre-release version of Hadoop 2.5 that I built work without this fix.\n\nTomorrow I'm going to do a closer comparison of the working versus non-working versions.  CDH5.1.0 should be pretty close to the pre-release 2.5, so that might be a good place for me to look for differences.  Maybe turning up log4j on YARN will reveal something.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/44374139/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/44374458","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/850#issuecomment-44374458","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/850","id":44374458,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0Mzc0NDU4","user":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-28T07:38:03Z","updated_at":"2014-05-28T07:38:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I should clarify that when I say \"fixes the trunk build\" I mean it fixes the trunk build when SPARK_YARN=1.

don't have a reference, and I did look for one. I am sure it is not optimal, and not even that great as a greedy algorithm. Two low-entropy distributions over target values could be high-entropy when combined. It's advantage is merely that it is linear in n, the number of feature values.\n\nYou could pick one feature value which makes the target lowest entropy, then pick the next one that would make the combined entropy of the target lowest, and so on. That amounts to testing n^2 instead of 2^n decisions.\n\nIf the alternative is to fail, or spend years in computation, I think heuristics of some kind are a must.

The second step will be the O(k) algorithm (k is the number of categorical feature values) that will come up with k sorted categorical feature splits using the target variable entropy for ordering.\n\nThe O(n^2) algorithm looked promising at first but I think it might end up dominating the tree computation time.\n\nIn general, getting 0(k) splits is more important than ensuring that they are sorted since we now have a way of dealing with unsorted splits with this PR. I currently don't have a good intuition on what makes a good subset of splits but we could keep adding more heuristics

For now the easiest way is for the\n> user's KryoRegistrator to call KryoRegistrators from these other libraries\n> inside itself.\n> \n> —\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/789#issuecomment-44239090\n> .\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/44400421/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/44400999","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/904#issuecomment-44400999","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/904","id":44400999,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NDAwOTk5","user":{"login":"AmplabJenkins","id":4031291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzEyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4031291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/AmplabJenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-28T12:43:19Z","updated_at":"2014-05-28T12:43:19Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Merged build finished.
