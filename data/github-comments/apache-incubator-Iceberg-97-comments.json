In Repair path, the specId is queried from the original manifest-file , and kept around to write the repaired manifest file (vs passed in).\r\n\r\nThere is also a problem I noticed, the returned ManifestFiles of RewriteManifests action is wrong if \"snapshotIdInheritanceEnabled\" is false (as this path rewrites the manifest-file to a final location).

It could be a base implementation for all of the LocationProviders, and would be a natural place in my opinion. We can avoid changing the public APIs if we provide a default implementation.\r\n\r\n- In this change, we only want to replace the references of paths in the content of `metadata` files. We do not wish to change where data/metadata is actually written. My understanding of `LocationProviders` is that they are used to get locations to write the data files and hence for this change, we don't want to change any LocationProvider implementation. \r\n\r\n> If there is any way to split this PR to smaller, more reviewer friendly ones that would be a big help for us, reviewers.\r\n\r\n- I tried to keep this change small initially. Specifically, in this PR, I tried to just introduce the new property and modify the read and write paths to use table property to do the necessary changes. Property is turned off my default. Yet, this turned out to be huge :) There will be several follow-up PRs such has handling metadata tables and writing unit tests. I will be happy to split this further if you think we can logically do so.

I understand that your single commit time is in the end bounded by the time you rewrite that file, but this almost sounds like we want to do merge-on-read even for metadata, which would be cool but likely an overkill for most users. In my mind, the metadata layer should be managed by the admin constantly, and it is much simpler to just periodically optimize the number of manifests in order to control the size of the manifest list file during each commit, which would also benefit scan planning performance at the same time.

Now it seems that we can selectively drop some fields but not the others. Is this the case? I'm not sure if I like the idea of dropping some but not all fields since the user has to know what the original list was. \r\n\r\nI think `WRITE IDENTIFIED BY col1,col2;` looks good for setting and replacing identifier fields, but I wonder what the command should be if we want to drop everything. Do we plan to make it `ALTER TABLE table WRITE IDENTIFIED BY;`? Would this look a bit odd as if the command hasn't finished, and potentially error prone if someone accidentally press `;` and enter when they are still coming up with the list? `UNSET`/`DROP` requires a completely different keyword which may reduce this risk.

I'll make some time to review this.\r\n> \r\n> I also know that while I was out there were a few PRs that I wasn't able to help move along. If you have a list of PRs that are important for you to get in, please send them to me and I'll make time to get them reviewed as I can. Thank you for being patient with me!\r\n\r\n@rdblue , thanks for your time.  All the PRs that were published by me are here : https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pulls/openinx .   There are three parts : \r\n\r\n1.   The first part is about improvement for iceberg+flink module,  I think this PR is the highest priority.   Others are related to flink CDC write path, let's discuss them in the second parts.\r\n\r\n2.  Write & analysis the change log events in format v2 iceberg table.   After #2410,  we could ingest change log events into apache iceberg by pure flink SQL now.  But we still have other important issues that need to be addressed: \r\na.   How to ensure the stability of streaming jobs ?  Currently, the most important PR is : https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2680 .  There are some other problems. For example, random change log events may cause a large number of parquet writers to be opened in a checkpoint, and eventually cause OOM of the job.  I will open a specific issue for that.\r\nb.  How to implement the compaction action for v2.   As we know we are implementing the minor compaction (I mean translate the equality deletes to pos-deletes ? ) , but I think we may could get this [major compaction](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2303) merged first (Of course , the current patch still has few concerns that need to be addressed,  I will do) . I also had a temporary fix for https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/2308, and will publish it to the apache repo for reviewing.  \r\n\r\n3.   Aliyun OSS + DLF integration work.  I had an opened PR for [aliyun OSS](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2230) and an pending PR for[ aliyun DLF integration](https://github.com/openinx/incubator-iceberg/pull/5) (now it's in my personal repo) .  Let's put these PRs aside for now, and I will try to split these PRs appropriately so that we can better review them in the future.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/867636720/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/867721540","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2512#issuecomment-867721540","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2512","id":867721540,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2NzcyMTU0MA==","user":{"login":"RussellSpitzer","id":413025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/413025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer","html_url":"https://github.com/RussellSpitzer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-24T15:14:31Z","updated_at":"2021-06-24T15:14:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Ok I think everything is good to go here!

All I care about is that those can be enforced and easily applied via cmd line + IDE.
