This is used in persistent threading model where all thread launches and communicate through the shared global memory.\r\n\r\nThis mechanism is needed in things like NCCL or persistent RNNs.  The current implementation of global barrier is hacky, where we have a global variable counter and keeps each thread block spin until the counter gets to a desired value. It is not guanranteed to work, unless all the required thread block launches. The next generation CUDA add official support for this\r\n\r\nThis is a feature that is not needed except for persistent RNNs, and I am not sure the current hack will work for AMD GPUs.
