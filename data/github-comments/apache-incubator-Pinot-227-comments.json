I think it might also cause bugs in other parts of the UI since `cluster` can be undefined for other uses of this component\r\n\r\n- `HomePage.tsx` we request `Instances` and pass clusterName\r\n- `Instances` returns `AsyncInstanceTable` with `showInstanceDetails` and `cluster` which tells that component to show all instance details\r\n- but to get all instance details, it needs the cluster name from props to fetch `LIVEINSTANCES`\r\n- I think we effectively need 3 if statements\r\n-- if showInstanceDetails, and cluster is defined, and cluster is an empty string; show the instance names and the rest of the data as \"Loading\"\r\n-- if showinstanceDetails, and cluster is defined, and cluster is a non-empty string; get the liveInstanceDetails and set that as the data\r\n-- otherwise, the current `else` statement\r\n\r\nLet me know if this makes sense and you want to implement it.

Databases are independent of each other and for example you cannot join tables in two different databases. AFAIK in MySQL _database_ and _schema_ is the same thing.

The correct SQL term would be _schema_ but given we already use that term we may use _namespace_ instead. BTW, in any schema may contain other schemas.

This will move src to `src.limit()` instead of based on bytes read ([ref](https://github.com/lz4/lz4-java/blob/master/src/java/net/jpountz/lz4/LZ4SafeDecompressor.java#L149)).\r\n\r\nI wasn't able to figure out a good way to round trip unit test this. I've added a comment on why the safe decompressor is chosen to hopefully avoid refactoring into the fast decompressor. With more understanding of the LZ4 algorithm I could probably edit some compressed data's bytes to cause this, but given that fast decompressor is deprecated I'd prefer if we can merge this without the test. \r\n\r\nI did a basic validation of the underlying decompress implementations. In general, perf differences are a wash and vary based on host/input:\r\n\r\n```\r\n+--------------+------------------------------+--------------+----------------+--------------+--------------+\r\n|Source        |Function Benchmarked          | Total Seconds|  Iterations/sec|  ns/Iteration|  % of default|\r\n+--------------+------------------------------+--------------+----------------+--------------+--------------+\r\n|Normal Text   |LZ4_decompress_safe()         | 140.382024000|          356170|          2807|       100.00%|\r\n|Normal Text   |LZ4_decompress_fast()         | 133.453277000|          374662|          2669|        95.06%|\r\n|              |                              |              |                |              |              |\r\n|Compressible  |LZ4_decompress_safe()         |  28.044312000|         1782892|           560|        19.98%|\r\n|Compressible  |LZ4_decompress_fast()         |  32.404868999|         1542978|           648|        23.08%|\r\n+--------------+------------------------------+--------------+----------------+--------------+--------------+\r\n\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1992606880/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1992738148","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/12629#issuecomment-1992738148","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/12629","id":1992738148,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c52xsVk","user":{"login":"Jackie-Jiang","id":17555551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTU1NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17555551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang","html_url":"https://github.com/Jackie-Jiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-12T23:33:01Z","updated_at":"2024-03-12T23:33:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This feature request could be relevant: #12315 \r\n\r\nAre you sure the extra latency comes from transferring query response?

Any other solution you can think of? Ideally, we should give back older record if not the latest. Not giving anything is what makes this issue more problematic.\r\n\r\n> The gap between add/remove should be on the order of microseconds afaict. \r\n\r\nYeah! But these can take more time as the updates are \"synchronized\". If any other thread of another partition tries to update the bitmap it can take higher time between which there can be a snapshot taken in FilterPlanNode.\r\n\r\n> Let's confirm if this is indeed the reason for result mismatch\r\n\r\nNote this is not result mismatch but MISSING results to be more precise. We are getting records for the primary key usually but intermittently there are NO records instead of stale records / mismatched records.

We used to miss data while starting a new consuming segment, but after fixing that, we found under-count or over-count issue like the one reported here.\r\n\r\nThere is another cause to this issue where queries might miss some data/PKs under data ingestion. The query processes segments (mutable and many immutable ones) in a non-deterministic order:\r\n1. if processing mutable segment firstly, the query might see less valid docs (under-count), as new data ingestion can invalidate docs in immutable segments before they get processed later\r\n2. if processing mutable segment last, the query might see more valid docs (over-count), as PKs of some newly ingested data may be processed while the query processes immutable segments earlier.\r\n\r\nTo solve this, we're thinking about to provide a consistent table view for queries for upsert tables. In general, we can take copy of bitmaps to form the consistent view for queries to use, while keeping ingesting data. Similar with what's proposed above.\r\n\r\nWe can take the copy on read path or write path:\r\n1. query threads to lock the consuming thread (and helix threads that are adding/replacing segments) and take copy of validDocId bitmaps, then release the lock and process the segments with bitmap copies. Pros: fresh view; Cons: costly and blocks ingestion as the query rate becomes higher.\r\n\r\n2. consuming thread (and also the helix threads) take copy of validDocId bitmaps, then atomically replace the old set of bitmaps with the new set. Queries use the bitmap copy to process segments. We can take copy periodically to amortize cost but sacrifice some data freshness, or take copy at handling individual record if we can do the copy very efficiently (only swap the updated 1 or 2 bitmaps into the consistent view atomically).\r\n\r\nThose options are not exclusive.

let consuming thread take copy of bitmaps periodically, then we don't need locks between query threads and consuming threads. The consuming thread pauses periodically to take the copy of bitmaps as it's the only one modifying the bitmaps, and no need to take any locks, it just create a new map of bitmaps and replace the old map atomically (using `volatile` variable).\r\n\r\nBut a challenge is that some helix threads can also modify bitmaps when replacing/adding segments. So we need to coordinate those 'writer' threads with a R/W lock, so that only one writer thread can take W lock to take the copy of bitmaps, blocking other writer threads from modifying the bitmaps; but all writer threads can proceed in parallel if no copy is being taken. Most of the time, it'd just be the consuming thread to refresh the copy of bitmaps.\r\n\r\nWe can also make both options work together, i.e. taking copy at query time for better data freshness and taking copy on writer threads periodically for efficiency. We may add a query option for a query to specify the freshness SLA (e.g. 0 for no tolerance, 1sec for some tolerance etc.). If the copy of bitmaps is not fresh enough, the query thread can take the W lock to refresh the copy of bitmaps immediately, which blocks the ingestion a bit (as tested, copying a map of 1000 entries took about 60us/op). Upon high qps, queries could share the copy taken by other query, to amortize the cost a bit.

To get more clarity -\r\n@Jackie-Jiang , @snleee, @tibrewalpratik17 - Why should minionInstanceTag be at taskTypeConfigsMap instead of being a table level config ? Do we want isolation at the table level or task level?\r\n@swaminathanmanish +1 on your point. I think that this feature naturally fits better to the tenant config?\r\n\r\nYes agreed to have a `minionTenant` concept as a table level config. Based on a discussion here - https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/11240#issuecomment-1662819235 we would also like to give the flexibility to override it as task-level too just in case there are lot of tasks for a table and we want to isolate those too or group similar tasks of different tables in dedicated minion-nodes (may be different SKUs based on tasks). \r\nI raised this patch to quickly give the option of isolating tasks first. Post this, can work on a patch to introduce `minionTenant` concept in Pinot. Anyways, since this task-level config will have higher precedence over table's tenant config, this change will be backward compatible even then. What do you all think about this?\r\n\r\nAlso, will address comments shortly and update the patch.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2008285510/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2008287295","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/12678#issuecomment-2008287295","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/12678","id":2008287295,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c53tAg_","user":{"login":"soumitra-st","id":127247229,"node_id":"U_kgDOB5WjfQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/127247229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumitra-st","html_url":"https://github.com/soumitra-st","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumitra-st/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumitra-st/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumitra-st/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumitra-st/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumitra-st/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumitra-st/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumitra-st/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumitra-st/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumitra-st/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-19T22:43:03Z","updated_at":"2024-03-19T22:43:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Pool creation fixed:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/12677#issuecomment-2008282891","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2008287295/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2008306194","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/12678#issuecomment-2008306194","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/12678","id":2008306194,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c53tFIS","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-19T22:59:30Z","updated_at":"2024-03-20T01:25:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## [Codecov](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/12678?dropdown=coverage&src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=apache) Report\nAll modified and coverable lines are covered by tests :white_check_mark:\n> Project coverage is 61.52%.
