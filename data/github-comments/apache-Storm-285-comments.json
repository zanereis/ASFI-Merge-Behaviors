I did some debugging on Travis on my fork and found 2 issues\r\n\r\n- The behavior of binding to _localhost_ seems somewhat inconsistent for Zookeeper and Kafka.  I noticed a bunch of ZK connection issues trying to connect to the hostname of the travis machine that wouldn't resolve.  Using _127.0.0.1_ fixes this\r\n- More importantly, there were timing issues related to creating the topic and the partition leaders being assigned.  `DynamicBrokersReader#getNumPartitions` will fail if the topic doesn't yet have leaders assigned to its partitions and this was the root of the NPE.  \r\n\r\nI fixed the second issue by waiting until the topic is fully ready in kafka (exists in zookeeper and all partitions have leaders) before attempting to use it.  I also adjusted the logic around emitting messages from the partition manager to allow for timing delays on the broker end as this was another cause of spurious failures.\r\n\r\nI've also adjusted the _integration-test_ parent pom version to match the current one in the branch.

This needs to be documented, and if accepted (or likely to be), I will do so. But if there's community consensus around NOT accepting this patch, I'd rather not waste the effort. \r\n\r\nThis only addresses the sub tasks of STORM-2153 that are marked \"in progress.\"\r\n\r\nThe other issues, particularly the RocksDb, is likely off the table for now, since RocksDb is now considered category x (on a side note, a number of Apache projects like Kafka and flink are in for some hurt in that respect, since they will likely have to migrate grate off of RocksDb very shortly).\r\n\r\nAs far as your other question, aggregation is left to the destination metrics system. The individual metrics are namespaced with topology, host, port, etc. that uniquely identify each event down to the component/executor level. The namespace uses dot (\".\") notation to make it easy for tools to parse.\r\n\r\nYou can effectively disable this feature by not registering any reporters. The metrics objects will still be there, but there will be no reporters doing anything with them. It would be a fairly simple optimization to only register the metrics objects if there are one or more reporters registered. (IIRC this was one for f the concerns you raised in one of the discussion threads...)\r\n\r\n@HeartSaVioR \r\n\r\nSee above for some of your questions.\r\n\r\nThis is an independent *alternative* to the existing metrics system.

prevented from progressing), so I'd like to see us move to a per-partition limit (PR here https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2156).
