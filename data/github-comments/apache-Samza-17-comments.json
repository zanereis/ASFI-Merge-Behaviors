\r\n\r\nLet me start with what flush and close mean for AzureBlobWriter interface. The interface expectation is that after flush all of the data sent so far is uploaded as a block to Azure and close means the blob is sealed (aka created or committed) with all the blocks so far. Thus flush could be a more frequently occurring operation whereas close is the final operation after which the writer can not opened to write any more messages.\r\nSo the flow is something like this \r\n                            writer.write (several times) --> writer.flush (can go back to write) --> writer.close\r\n                                           \r\nNow coming to AzureBlobAvroWriter impl - it is the same meaning as the interface expects. Only difference arises due to the use of Avro's DataFileWriter. Used as follows\r\n            avroWriter --> DataFileWriter (avro piece) --> AzureBlobOutputStream (uploads/commits to Azure)\r\n\r\nAzureBlobAvroWriter.close has to call DataFileWriter.close which internally calls flush and that writes some bytes (indicating end of block kind of stuff) to the output stream which puts it into the last block of the blob.  \r\n\r\nNow finally coming to the current issue: earlier, the blob was committed by calling AzureBlobOutputSteam.close even when DataFileWriter.close fails. which meant blocks uploaded so far will be used to make a blob - but this might miss the last bytes from DFW leading to an invalid/unreadable blob. The better thing to do is to discard the blob so that the user of the system producer has a chance to re-try all the messages for the blob.\r\n\r\nI know this is a very long response.

A synchronization marker is written between blocks, so that files may be split.\r\n\r\nDFW.close calls DFW.flush which inturn calls DFW.sync() whose doc says\r\n>  Forces the end of the current block, emitting a synchronization marker. By default, this will also flush the block to the stream (AzureBlobOutputStream = ABOS in our case).\r\n\r\nI just realized when responding to your comment that AvroWriter.close is always preceeded by AvroWriter.flush  - that is the requirement for close as per the documentation of AvroWriter and that is how it is used in the SystemProducer right now. Now, AvroWriter.flush also calls DFW.flush. Hence DFW.flush is called twice in succession and hence the second sync() becomes a no-op as there are no DFW blocks to force end of. This could very well be the reason why we have not seen invalid blobs due to this issue. \r\n\r\nLet me mull over this a bit more and get back. \r\nPart of me still says this PR is necessary for 2 reasons: it is essential to discard the blob and to not rely on DFW impl details (DFW.close calling flush or DFW.flush calling DFW.sync). And that since the exception will anyways be bubbled even if we commit the blob despite this exception - System producer user would most likely have re-tried the messages for this blob resulting in an another blob with same messages getting created. Two blobs instead of one does not break our promise but maybe undesirable. \r\n\r\nand another part of me says that this PR is not a must-have but a nice to-have: current impl of DFW and AvroWriter are working well enough to ensure that DFW.flush inside DFW.close is kind of no-op. So essentially DFW.close is doing only ABOS.close i think. So, in case of failure of DFW.close doing ABOS.close might not be totally bad. However, this is very dependent on the current impl of DFW and the binaryEncoders it uses to write to ABOS. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/631560831/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/631758857","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/samza/pull/1362#issuecomment-631758857","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/1362","id":631758857,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzMTc1ODg1Nw==","user":{"login":"bkonold","id":2802866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MDI4NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2802866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkonold","html_url":"https://github.com/bkonold","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkonold/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkonold/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkonold/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkonold/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkonold/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkonold/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkonold/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkonold/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkonold/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-20T22:21:04Z","updated_at":"2020-05-20T22:21:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@lakshmi-manasa-g I agree with your suggestion that relying on implementation details is unideal; we can rely on contracts that are established through the documentation of the library but implementations can and will change as you imply.\r\n\r\nIf possible let us speak on this offline; I'd like to better understand the flow here and how we can most clearly delineate responsibility between flush & close.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/631758857/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/631785930","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/samza/pull/1292#issuecomment-631785930","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/1292","id":631785930,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzMTc4NTkzMA==","user":{"login":"mynameborat","id":46942335,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2OTQyMzM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46942335?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mynameborat","html_url":"https://github.com/mynameborat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mynameborat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mynameborat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mynameborat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mynameborat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mynameborat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mynameborat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mynameborat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mynameborat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mynameborat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-20T23:13:35Z","updated_at":"2020-05-20T23:13:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@kathulasandeep Sorry for not getting back earlier.

is my understanding that we override generated configs to allow for job deployment to be reconfigured without building a new binary of the job.

IMO,  `ApplicationRunners` only contains a single method `getApplicationRunner` which constructs the an `ApplicationRunner` with reflection. I would expect `ApplicationRunnerUtil#invoke` is the actual method help users to launch application instead of `ApplicationRunners`.

It looks like @nickpan47 initially added this `ApplicationRunners` class.
