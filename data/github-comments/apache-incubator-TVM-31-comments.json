I have implemented it in my codebase, but my company has its own open source rule and need long time to contribute. So if you want to implement continually,   I am glad to see it. And you also need  to update WORKLOADS. i.e.:\r\n```python\r\n_Workload = namedtuple('Workload',\r\n                       ['in_dtype', 'out_dtype', 'height', 'width', 'channel', 'multiplier',\r\n                        'hkernel', 'wkernel', 'hpad', 'wpad', 'hstride', 'wstride'])\r\n```\r\nHere, it only has hpad / wpad，you should update to 4 elements. It also affects schedule.

We don't want the user to pay the size of the debug code when the debug is not used(affects the binary size of libtvm_runtime.so), here is a way to do so\r\n\r\nThis will be taken as you said. I have done these modifications. Since the code is protected under compilation macro USE_GRAPH_RUNTIME_DEBUG, user need to change makefile,  build and install tvm again to enable the debug whereas in most other platforms, user can go to debug environment without much overhead.\r\n\r\n> Please include a specification of the json schema that the UX is proposed to take\r\n1. GRAPH. Here we do not need any special format change for the graph.  curses_ux can directly use the nnvm graph json format for visualising the graph data. So we donot need to do conversion two times. If any new UX is added, it can add a wrapper to convert to its own format.\r\n2. TENSOR data. For Tensordata, I suggest to use numpy format for dumping from tvm and loading in UX, this is how its done currently. Any other thoughts?\r\n\r\n> Please include a proposal on how we can interface this json schema with tensorboard\r\n\r\nTo visualise the NNVM graph using tensorboard, similar to MXBOARD, TVM can introduce a new component TVMBOARD _(this can be either part of tvm repo or could be another repo like mxboard)_. Tvmboard will convert the graph and tensors from tvm format to tensorboard format.\r\nThe graphical visualisation, tensor data and the profiling data will be transformed by TVMBOARD for loading in tensorboard. Achieving the debugger functionality via tensorboard need to analyse further.\r\n\r\n**Proposed Folder Structure**\r\nUnder `tvm/python/tvm/ `will add new folder `tools`\r\ntvm\r\n..contrib\r\n..exec\r\n..ffi\r\n _..tools\r\n.......└── tvmdbg\r\n................├── runtime\r\n................├── tvmboard\r\n................└── curses_ux_\r\n\r\nUnder `tvm/src/runtime/graph` add new folder `debug`\r\n\r\n`tvmdbg/runtime` :- Consists of exposed debug interfaces to frontend; Distributing data to curses_ux/tvmboard.\r\n`tvmdbg/tvmboard` :- Tvmboard will convert the graph and tensors from tvm format to tensorboard format.\r\n`tvmdbg/curses_ux` :- An ncurses based ux tool to visualize the graph, tensor data and debugging.\r\n`runtime/graph/debug` :- A debug wrapper over GraphRuntime class to extend the runtime  debug functionalities.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/401336351/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/401474677","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/1345#issuecomment-401474677","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1345","id":401474677,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMTQ3NDY3Nw==","user":{"login":"tmoreau89","id":5974488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQ0ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89","html_url":"https://github.com/tmoreau89","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-29T21:09:20Z","updated_at":"2018-06-29T21:09:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"One question: will this flow support all three of (1) hw emulation, (2), sw emulation, (3), actual hardware execution on the FPGA. \r\nIn this case will the runtime always check for FPGA device, or only for case 3?\r\nI can imagine launching an regular CPU instance with an FPGA development AMI, instead of an F1 instance, just to test OpenCL synthesis in software emulation/hardware emulation.\r\n\r\nAnother question, is how the different hardware FPGA backends should be handled by the runtime.

The issue is not just destruction order across statics in the project (although it is important to have a robust way of dealing with this), the issue is that, on windows at least, some libraries may be unloaded before others have their static destructors invoked, and AFAIK we cannot control this ordering.\r\n\r\nFundamentally, when any static destructor runs from a library, we cannot know what other libraries have already been unloaded by the OS (and that includes libraries like the vuklan API lib), so making calls across library boundaries in static destructors is potentially unsafe.\r\n\r\nThe only way I can think of resolving this is with an eager destructor because we know no libraries have been unloaded when it is called.\r\n\r\nDefinitely agree it should be idempotent.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure it should be called automatically if the app doesn't call it - this is likely to trigger exactly this kind of hard to debug problem, and if the process is being torn down anyway the OS will handle the cleanup.\r\n
