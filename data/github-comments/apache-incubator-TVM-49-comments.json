thank you. I was able to reproduce the error. On my machine, typical numeric error is `1e-7` or less, which is a bit higher than the default value of `atol` (1e-8). Most of the time, relative tolerance prevents assert from triggering but in rare cases RNG happens to generate operands close to zero. In such cases relative tolerance become infinitesimal, so the error condition hits. Increasing `atol` seems to be a correct fix. I am approving the PR.\r\n\r\nAs @junrushao1994 also points out, we use `assert_allclose` extensively. In the same time, `atol` are only set in rare cases, which is probably wrong as we may see now.\r\n\r\n```\r\ntvm $ git grep assert_allclose | grep -v atol | wc -l\r\n258\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/425887011/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/425970325","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/1784#issuecomment-425970325","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1784","id":425970325,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNTk3MDMyNQ==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-01T16:22:06Z","updated_at":"2018-10-01T16:22:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"good point, maybe we want to send pr to change these place preemptively","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/425970325/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/426021942","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/1789#issuecomment-426021942","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1789","id":426021942,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNjAyMTk0Mg==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-01T18:54:37Z","updated_at":"2018-10-01T18:54:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks @zhiics for very helpful comments, i have fixed them, can you please take another round of look?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/426021942/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/426022076","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/1792#issuecomment-426022076","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1792","id":426022076,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNjAyMjA3Ng==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-01T18:55:03Z","updated_at":"2018-10-01T18:55:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks @slyubomirsky !
