summarize the discussion: \r\n\r\nA Universal Local Runner is one that can run pipelines in any language based on the proto definition of a pipeline, spinning up workers (as subprocesses, containers, or similar.) This can be useful to have in more than one language (e.g. for testing, development, ...) just as it's useful to have multiple direct runners. \r\n\r\nWe also want a reference implementation, which will be a ULR, and there is a preference to have this written in Java in case it's useful for other runners (currently all in Java) to borrow code/ideas.
