One of the use cases that iceberg works great with is having table data in different locations. As long as we specify the full path, we can create a table with data in multiple locations. \r\nThe problem that this PR is trying to address is when we want to migrate table from one location to another location, we have to rebuild the metadata to update manifest and data file locations. I am wondering if there is a better way to address this issue instead of using relative paths. Also, we could make using relative paths optional and specify during table creation or have base path per manifest i.e. each manifest will have a base path and data files in the manifest will be relative to that.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/534365040/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/534368931","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/430#issuecomment-534368931","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/430","id":534368931,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNDM2ODkzMQ==","user":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-24T03:09:35Z","updated_at":"2019-09-24T03:09:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks a lot @rdblue and sorry for late response.

From the stack trace you posted, it looks like this is correctly using an `OptionWriter` to handle the case where the string is not set (hence the data may be corrupt) but that appears to not be the problem.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/535120609/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/535120952","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/463#issuecomment-535120952","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/463","id":535120952,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNTEyMDk1Mg==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-25T17:12:05Z","updated_at":"2019-09-25T17:12:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm not sure where this data is coming from because your dataframe has only one column, `id`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/535120952/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/535155920","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/494#issuecomment-535155920","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/494","id":535155920,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNTE1NTkyMA==","user":{"login":"holdenk","id":59893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5ODkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk","html_url":"https://github.com/holdenk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-25T18:38:29Z","updated_at":"2019-09-25T18:38:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I know (that’s why I included the git hash I was on when I noticed this) but it still seems like it flakes.

I'm handling it in `Conversions` by returning an epochday ordinal which is in a Integer. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/536554025/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/536554873","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/506#issuecomment-536554873","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/506","id":536554873,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNjU1NDg3Mw==","user":{"login":"prodeezy","id":1474591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzQ1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1474591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prodeezy","html_url":"https://github.com/prodeezy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prodeezy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prodeezy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prodeezy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prodeezy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prodeezy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prodeezy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prodeezy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prodeezy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prodeezy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-30T13:13:56Z","updated_at":"2019-09-30T13:13:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"cc @aokolnychyi @rdblue @fbocse @rominparekh ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/536554873/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/536635882","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/505#issuecomment-536635882","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/505","id":536635882,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNjYzNTg4Mg==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-30T16:14:23Z","updated_at":"2019-09-30T16:14:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Doesn't PR #506 fix #428? That's basically what it does.\r\n\r\nI'm fine adding that commit if it unblocks you, but this type of bug is going to keep happening to you if you continue to use this pattern where you write files and then use paths to build partition data when appending to a table. The `withPartitionPath` method is only intended for use with Hive partitions, and even then it is a best effort. Iceberg doesn't guarantee that partition strings even can be parsed to produce the original value because that has been an error prone anti-pattern in Hive.\r\n\r\nThis is going to cause further problems with strings that require escaping, hourly partitions, etc. I suggest moving off of this pattern and keeping the partition tuples as data instead of recovering partition tuple values like this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/536635882/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/536637573","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/507#issuecomment-536637573","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/507","id":536637573,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNjYzNzU3Mw==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-30T16:18:31Z","updated_at":"2019-09-30T16:18:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@aokolnychyi, @prodeezy, what do you think about this issue and possibly targeting this for the release?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/536637573/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/536638571","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/507#issuecomment-536638571","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/507","id":536638571,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNjYzODU3MQ==","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-30T16:20:59Z","updated_at":"2019-09-30T16:21:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"We used that only for importing existing tables to Iceberg.

I forgot about that one, but it puts us over the limit: Spark will have its own connection from the built-in metastore. Then we have a pool from `HiveCatalogs` that is reused, with two connections. One more connection for the direct client used to clean up, and two more for the `HiveCatalog` instance. That comes to 6, which is over the limit. Maybe if we add back the change to share the client pool for cleanup with the catalog used in tests?\r\n\r\nLet's bring these tests back in a PR, but keep this in master for now to unblock the release and avoid so many test failures for PRs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/537106532/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/537994844","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/512#issuecomment-537994844","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/512","id":537994844,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNzk5NDg0NA==","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-03T15:25:56Z","updated_at":"2019-10-03T15:25:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bryanck could you take a look?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/537994844/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
