@CatYangWei @childewuque \r\n`autoTable` is a feature to let users do not care about the specific distribution of the tables, just tell shardingsphere how many pieces to split the tables into.\r\n\r\nThere are currently no other documents and examples to illustrate `autoTable`, we will write an article to introduce this feature in the future.\r\n\r\nThanks for your attention.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/871861869/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/871888601","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/pull/11060#issuecomment-871888601","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/11060","id":871888601,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3MTg4ODYwMQ==","user":{"login":"soulasuna","id":33794770,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzk0Nzcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33794770?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/soulasuna","html_url":"https://github.com/soulasuna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soulasuna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soulasuna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soulasuna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soulasuna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soulasuna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soulasuna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soulasuna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soulasuna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soulasuna/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-01T03:37:48Z","updated_at":"2021-07-01T03:37:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks
