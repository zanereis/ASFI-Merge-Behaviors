actually fine with the patch, however, I'm a bit struggling to understand the cause\r\nthis unit test looks like describing an exact scenario (see comment above testInternalPreemption), however the underlying taskattempt ids look like a mess to me :) \r\nI mean, the current state without the patch is:\r\n```\r\n        createStep(\"v1 : 00000[01]_0\", CriticalPathDependency.INIT_DEPENDENCY),\r\n        createStep(\"v2 : 00000[01]_0\", CriticalPathDependency.DATA_DEPENDENCY),\r\n        createStep(\"v3 : 000000_0\", CriticalPathDependency.DATA_DEPENDENCY, \r\n            TaskAttemptTerminationCause.INTERNAL_PREEMPTION, null),\r\n        createStep(\"v2 : 00000[01]_1\", CriticalPathDependency.OUTPUT_RECREATE_DEPENDENCY),\r\n        createStep(\"v1 : 000000_1\", CriticalPathDependency.OUTPUT_RECREATE_DEPENDENCY,\r\n            null, Collections.singletonList(\"preemption of v3\")),\r\n        createStep(\"v2 : 00000[01]_1\", CriticalPathDependency.DATA_DEPENDENCY),\r\n        createStep(\"v3 : 000000_1\", CriticalPathDependency.DATA_DEPENDENCY)\r\n```\r\nthis PR modifies the third occurrence of v2 to 00000[01]_[12], so if it's just sometimes 000001_2, and is 000001_1 for the rest, then the second occurrence of v2 is also weird: 00000[01]_1, so it's the same task attempt id (1)?...\r\nis it possible?\r\ndo all of the scenarios make sense and test what we expect?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tez/issues/comments/2116938810/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tez/issues/comments/2116941635","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tez/pull/356#issuecomment-2116941635","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tez/issues/356","id":2116941635,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAI3Dy85-LfdD","user":{"login":"tez-yetus","id":76000678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDAwNjc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76000678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tez-yetus","html_url":"https://github.com/tez-yetus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tez-yetus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tez-yetus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tez-yetus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tez-yetus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tez-yetus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tez-yetus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tez-yetus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tez-yetus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tez-yetus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-17T07:39:49Z","updated_at":"2024-05-17T07:40:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":":broken_heart:
