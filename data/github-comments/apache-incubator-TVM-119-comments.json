One of the challenges is that different backends have different needs, for example the memory bus:\r\n\r\n`Pynq` data:64-bit and address:32-bit\r\n`Ultra96` data:128-bit and address:64-bit\r\n`F1` data:512-bit and address:64-bit\r\n`TSIM` will now with virtual-memory be data:64-bit address:32-bit (then translated into 64-bit)\r\n\r\nThe challenge is that these addressing affects also the runtime, so I believe we could go back to 32-bit for the moment and later figure out what would be the best way for scaling it.\r\n\r\n[These](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/master/vta/src/runtime.cc#L1016-L1020) are still needed though because the current chisel version takes `sizes` in bytes directly and not normalized.\r\n\r\nI don't know if all this make sense?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/517772479/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/517790690","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3686#issuecomment-517790690","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3686","id":517790690,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNzc5MDY5MA==","user":{"login":"tmoreau89","id":5974488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQ0ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89","html_url":"https://github.com/tmoreau89","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-02T17:52:26Z","updated_at":"2019-08-02T17:52:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vegaluisjose good points, addressing the multiplicity of data and address widths can be done in a separate PR since it will require runtime changes.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/517790690/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/517791412","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3686#issuecomment-517791412","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3686","id":517791412,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNzc5MTQxMg==","user":{"login":"tmoreau89","id":5974488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQ0ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89","html_url":"https://github.com/tmoreau89","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-02T17:54:53Z","updated_at":"2019-08-02T17:54:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Also I would feel more comfortable if we would run the TSIM tests in the CI to ensure that things remain stable. @liangfu is that something you want to take a stab at?

@tmoreau89 thanks for leading this.\r\n\r\nIsn't going back to enable through CMAKE a similar thing than having it in the `json` file? this is how we used to have it initially. In my opinion is better to set any target in the same way and not have another level of indirection for a particular one. All targets `sim`, `tsim`, `pynq`, `ultra96`, `f1`, `etc` should all be built in the same way.\r\n\r\nRegarding the simulation libraries (`sim` and `tsim`). I think it is better to actually build two shared libraries once somebody builds TVM like `vta_sim.so` and `vta_tsim.so`. We don't have to worry about any Verilator dependencies because we are using function pointers and Verilator dependency kicks in only when you want to build the shared library for chisel version.\r\n\r\nAlso, if we decided to go this route we could even have a way of generating a library for your target say `vta_pynq.so` or `vta_your_fpga.so`. The cool thing about this is that you don't have to rely on the `config.json` file for selecting target in python. Then, we could be able to select target directly from python without rebuilding again. Also, it is extremely straightforward to know what was the target of a particular library, which is not the case right now with a pure `vta` name.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/517973552/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/517973909","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3704#issuecomment-517973909","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3704","id":517973909,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNzk3MzkwOQ==","user":{"login":"tmoreau89","id":5974488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQ0ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89","html_url":"https://github.com/tmoreau89","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-04T05:00:18Z","updated_at":"2019-08-04T05:00:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the feedback Luis, I think we can build TSIM by default in either simulation modes then in order to always generate have both `vta_sim.so` and `vta_tsim.so`; and check upon runtime that the hardware library was built by the chisel make; and if not error out.\r\n\r\nWhen in `pynq`, `ultra96` etc. mode it's not necessary to build these simulation libraries, so I'll leave them out (since building the rpc_runtime already takes a while)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/517973909/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/517974272","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3704#issuecomment-517974272","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3704","id":517974272,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNzk3NDI3Mg==","user":{"login":"tmoreau89","id":5974488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQ0ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89","html_url":"https://github.com/tmoreau89","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-04T05:09:02Z","updated_at":"2019-08-04T05:09:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vegaluisjose I've made the change so that in either simulation modes, we always build both `tsim` and `sim` drivers.

I think we need to find a better alternative to implement the current PR. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, the current way uses a file for exchanging information between two threads, which is neither safe(file system consistency issues) or efficient(have to do address translation each time we access one element in the memory, and will slowdown the simulation greatly).\r\n\r\nGiven that TSIM executes both the device simulation and the host on the same process(different thread). There is no need to exchange the information via a file. Instead, we should just get these information in memory. \r\n\r\nThere are a few alternative approaches. For example, we can grab a shared_ptr to the current virtual memory table(which is global) in the TSIM API by having the DPI module depends on the TSIM. \r\n\r\nAlso please note again that the logics in https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/master/vta/src/sim/sim_driver.cc#L124 can possibly be re-used(it is a virtual memory table).

I admit current implement is neither safe or efficient, and I agree it's important to reuse the code. However, I think there are might be some misunderstanding regarding to this specific case for `tsim_driver`. To address your comments, \r\n(I might be wrong, and please feel free to point it out.)\r\n\r\n> Specifically, the current way uses a file for exchanging information between two threads\r\n\r\nFirst, the reason I use a file for exchanging information is that `DPIModule`, `tsim_driver.cc` and `tsim_device.cc` are isolated in different shared libraries, they are built inside `libtvm.so`, `libvta.so` and `libvta_hw.so` respectively. I have no idea how to use `shared_ptr` in exchanging the address mapping between isolated shared libraries.\r\n\r\nSecond, as I have shown in #3713 , the vta runtime doesn't actually use a thread for executing the instructions. Therefore, I think it's not 'two threads', and currently it's safe to remove `lock_guard` in a virtual memory implementation. \r\n\r\n> have to do address translation each time we access one element in the memory, and will slowdown the simulation greatly\r\n\r\nIMHO, the `DRAM` class inside `sim_driver` cannot avoid address translation when trying to evaluate its value in the virtual address space. I mean we still need to call the `DRAM::GetPhyAddr` function (, or I might be wrong here). @tqchen Would you please elaborate a little bit more?\r\n\r\n> Also please note again that the logics in `sim_driver` can possibly be re-used\r\n\r\nOK, I came to aware of this, let's reuse the code when possible.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/518473998/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/518500185","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3710#issuecomment-518500185","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3710","id":518500185,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxODUwMDE4NQ==","user":{"login":"zhiics","id":5145158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDUxNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5145158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics","html_url":"https://github.com/zhiics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-06T05:00:01Z","updated_at":"2019-08-06T05:00:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"cc @yongwww as well","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/518500185/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/518523616","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3642#issuecomment-518523616","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3642","id":518523616,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxODUyMzYxNg==","user":{"login":"cbalint13","id":3974360,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzQzNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3974360?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13","html_url":"https://github.com/cbalint13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-06T06:27:53Z","updated_at":"2019-08-06T06:27:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Currently, the spaces of `P` and other knobs that are dependent on `tile_size` are created with `tile_size=2`\r\n> Should we modify the spaces of these knobs to be the union of all valid values or wait until you implement the conditional knob?\r\n\r\n* I would implement conditional/hierarchical knob,  partially done, need to validate/test.

Currently `Type` basically means dtype and shape. I think it is very useful to have `Layout` there as well. If thats the case, the `Legalize` API will get arg_dtypes, and thus layout, enabling transformation based on input layouts.\r\n\r\nThis also means `infer_type` gets more complicated, as it will have to infer layout as well. However, I think it should be fine to have some Layouts as undefined/non-inferable (something like that).\r\n\r\n@tqchen @merrymercy @zhiics ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/518884668/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/518890871","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/3720#issuecomment-518890871","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3720","id":518890871,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxODg5MDg3MQ==","user":{"login":"icemelon","id":2696494,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTY0OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2696494?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon","html_url":"https://github.com/icemelon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-07T00:21:40Z","updated_at":"2019-08-07T00:21:40Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"cc @jroesch @wweic @MarisaKirisame ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/518890871/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
