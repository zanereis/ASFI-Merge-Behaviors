sorry but I can't do this issue. After strict investigation of tests results, I still see failed tests with my PR. And I truly don't understand a reason.\r\nI found two type of unclear using of `DiscoveryDataClusterState`.\r\n\r\n**1. Concurrency using**\r\n`DiscoveryDataClusterState.transitionRes` + `GridClusterStateProcessor.transitionFuts` are working together like a future: `DiscoveryDataClusterState.transitionRes` used for value passing and `GridClusterStateProcessor.transitionFuts` used as a latch.\r\n\r\n**2. Serialization**\r\nThere is logic based on the fact some fields are `transient` and some other is not. It breaks some invariants which I think I see in code (object become partly initialized).\r\n\r\nBut some bugs still here, so maybe there is something else.\r\n\r\nI think we should make clear using of `DiscoveryDataClusterState` before this issue became resolvable.\r\n\r\nOr maybe someone else will be
