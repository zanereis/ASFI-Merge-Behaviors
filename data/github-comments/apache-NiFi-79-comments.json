I believe I have resolved all of these [6a80063313f9c8e03a1f42ae84813cabd5fc8349](https://github.com/alopresto/nifi/commit/6a80063313f9c8e03a1f42ae84813cabd5fc8349). There are also the following issues:\r\n\r\n* It looks like somehow an empty file was added at `nifi/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-update-attribute-bundle/nifi-update-attribute-ui/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/jsp/authorize.jsp`. I only noticed this because it failed the RAT check. I imagine this can be deleted?\r\n* An unused field remains in `AbstractOAuthControllerService`: `protected long expireTimeSafetyNetSeconds = -1;`\r\n* `OAuth2ClientCredentialsGrantControllerService.CLIENT_ID` and `OAuth2ClientCredentialsGrantControllerService.CLIENT_SECRET` don't support expression language (with the variable registry and NiFi Registry, these values will likely be populated externally)\r\n* The exception handling in `OAuth2ClientCredentialsGrantControllerService#authenticate` can be condensed\r\n* There are no unit or integration tests. I understand a real integration test with an external service is difficult, but unit tests for `OAuth2ClientCredentialsGrantControllerService#authenticate()` (via mocking `OAuthHTTPConnectionClient#execute()`) and `AbstractOAuthControllerService#isOAuthTokenExpired()` would be helpful\r\n* There is no update to the User Guide or Admin Guide describing this feature. At a minimum, the `InvokeHTTP` processor documentation should be updated\r\n\r\nI am in the process of configuring an external OAuth service to use with this. Will have a final review once that evaluation is complete.

Still needs the License and Notice in the client service nar.\r\n\r\nAlso, it's a bit of an anti-pattern to have the logging and error handling in the Controller Service for methods called by the processor. This is because any time there is a problem with the search, the bulletin is logged at the Controller Service. This means that not only will a user not know which processor is the cause of the error (since it could be shared) but also when looking at the map the processor appears to be working without issue. Lastly, since the error isn't bubbled back to the processor, it never yields so if there is something wrong with the query it will continually error and log without pause. \r\n\r\nRelated, there's also some weirdness with error handling when there is an incoming connection. Currently, input is only sent to Failure instead of Original when an error is caught at the top level. This means that if a query is messed up and is caught as a JsonProcessingException in the Controller service, the input will be routed to original and no other outputs. As a user, I would expect that flowfile to be sent to Failure.\r\n\r\nSo in summary, the CS should let the calling processor decide how to handle any exceptions encountered during processing. This allows the processor to more granularlly decide what to do under different situations. For example, was it a JSON parsing exception and it's acting as a source processor? well we better yield the whole processor since it's probably just going to continually fail. Is there an incoming connection but some network error happened when searching? again, later FlowFiles will probably fail too, so we should yield. If you have any questions on when to yield the processor vs penalizing the FlowFile, feel free to ask.\r\n\r\nLastly, it's preferred if you don't squash your commits every time. If you don't, that allows the reviewer to more easily see exactly what changed since they last reviewed it. Also allows reviewers to see how the PR evolved over time in response to different comments.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/373938759/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/373956163","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2113#issuecomment-373956163","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2113","id":373956163,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3Mzk1NjE2Mw==","user":{"login":"MikeThomsen","id":108184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODE4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeThomsen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-17T22:02:42Z","updated_at":"2018-03-17T22:02:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@JPercivall Thanks for the feedback.

Again, not discouraging you from contributing just helping you see the other side of the equation.\r\n\r\nThanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/374221606/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/374221718","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2405#issuecomment-374221718","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2405","id":374221718,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NDIyMTcxOA==","user":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-19T14:01:18Z","updated_at":"2018-03-19T14:01:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hey @adfel70 I think I was looking at this PR the wrong way. I didn't notice the addition of the POST request, which is very vital. Because of that, I thought this was making a very large number of requests, but after reviewing the confluent API docs and reviewing the code again it all makes sense. The caching in this layer is different than the caching at the higher layer but was only really necessary for the routine that was there previously, before the POST request. I think your solution handles this case much better than the previous solution. And more importantly your solution appears to be correct :) I was able to test locally and see that if i changed the schema reference to an older version of an existing schema that things work correctly with this PR and did not without the PR. So I've merged this to master. Thanks for the fix and for the patience in getting it all sorted out!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/374221718/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/374223210","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2485#issuecomment-374223210","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2485","id":374223210,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NDIyMzIxMA==","user":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-19T14:05:43Z","updated_at":"2018-03-19T14:05:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @joewitt - have rebased and addressed merge conflict.

What we need most right now is help reviewing outstanding PRs.  This involves reviewing code and validating as possible whether things are actually functioning.  For things like this it can be tougher because it means someone needs an environment with influx running/etc.. and familiarity on how to do so.  What can you do?  You can provide detailed instructions a reviewer could follow to verify functionality.  Perhaps a pointer to a docker container which eases the process.  And help with reviews on other items, for example.  Not saying someone wont look at this until then - they certainly might.
