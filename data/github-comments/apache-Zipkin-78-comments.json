not yet.\r\nThere are some tests, but these are not enough.\r\nI have to add tests.\r\n\r\nBut I think what I have to do at first is refactoring codes before adding tests, because I believe that these bugs will never occur again by refactoring and appropriate use prop types.\r\nThe refactoring I believe is necessary is below.\r\n\r\n1. **Split props properly**\r\n\r\nCurrently traces related props are large objects such as `traceSummary` like the following.\r\nhttps://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/blob/9b91acbaa3b90ad1c9e4ab62489db05dfd9edf74/zipkin-lens/src/components/Browser/Traces/Trace.js#L15\r\nThis is too bad... :sob: \r\nprops should be primitive as much as possible.\r\nIt helps us find such bugs early.\r\n\r\n2. **Define prop types strictly**\r\n\r\nCurrently the definitions of the prop types are too rough like the following.\r\nhttps://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/blob/9b91acbaa3b90ad1c9e4ab62489db05dfd9edf74/zipkin-lens/src/components/Browser/Traces/Trace.js#L15\r\nThis is a bad way as prop types tell us a type bug.\r\nSo I should define prop types strictly like the following\r\n\r\n```\r\ntraceSummary: PropTypes.shape({\r\n  serviceSummaries: PropTypes.arrayOf({\r\n    serviceName: PropTypes.string,\r\n    ...\r\n  }),\r\n  ...\r\n}).isRequired,\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBut these changes are quite large.\r\nShould I do it now or later ... :thinking:
