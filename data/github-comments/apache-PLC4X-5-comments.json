Chris,\n\nTotally understand the reasons regarding the ets project file not being\nadded to the repo, kind of limits testing of the parser though. How would\nyou feel about just adding some 'hand crafted' XML files, just to exercise\nthe parser?\n\nI've a couple more questions to ask. I'm still experiencing the invalid\ndecoding of the 2-byte floating point values.. My recollection was you were\ngoing to contact KNX and see if they were aware of this issue, and then I\nthink we were going to try and progress things with the code generators\ntogether. Was that right?\n\nAnd secondly, is there a method used elsewhere in PLC4X where it is\npossible to specify the local IP to bind to when connecting out? i.e. in\nthe Knx driver there is no way to specify which network interface to use if\nyou have multiple on your computer, if there is a prefered way I'm happy to\nimplement that in the Knx driver. Perhaps this is only relevant to UDP\nconnections? It's been a fair few years since I've had to write low level\nTCP and UDP code.\n\nMany thanks\n\nDarren\n\nOn Tue, Feb 22, 2022 at 10:14 AM Christofer Dutz ***@***.***>\nwrote:\n\n> Regarding a knxproj file being added to the project.
