@CalvinKirs \r\n\r\nI wondered if this would make it more user-friendly,\r\n\r\nSQL query result display has the email and log printing, on the front page for users to choose more the result display, set up the article a SQL query number limit parameters, the user can select only the log printing way, also can only choose mail way, also can also choose one of two ways (choice is at the same time may produce a large amount of data, this can agree)\r\nIn addition, I choose two display methods of log printing and email sending at the same time. I feel that the data can be viewed in either way many times at a time. Why should I view the data in both ways at the same time?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n我想了一下这样调整会不会对用户更友好一些，\r\nsql查询结果展示方式有邮件发送和日志打印，在前端页面可供用户进行多选结果展示方式，设置一个sql查询条数限制参数，用户可以只选择日志打印方式,也可以只选择邮件发送方式,也可以同时选择两种方式（同时选择的时候就是可能会产生很大的数据量，这个可以认同）\r\n\r\n并且同时选择日志打印和邮件发送两种展示方法，我感觉多次一举，在任何一种方式都可以查看数据，为什么要两种方式同时查看？\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/803282384/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/803282617","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/pull/4899#issuecomment-803282617","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/4899","id":803282617,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwMzI4MjYxNw==","user":{"login":"zhuangchong","id":37063904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDYzOTA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37063904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangchong","html_url":"https://github.com/zhuangchong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangchong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangchong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangchong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangchong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangchong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangchong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangchong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangchong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangchong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-20T09:59:25Z","updated_at":"2021-03-20T09:59:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@chengshiwen

So this is just the beginning, rather than the perfection of technical details. Isn't it a more interesting thing? Rome was not built in a day. Let's think back that the 1.2.x version of ds also fetched tasks directly from workers.\r\n\r\nBecause the pressure of the database caused the concurrency of DS scheduling to be questioned, we have saved a lot of time in the latest version to reduce the pressure on the database. I still recommend optimizing the call to the database before the merge.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/803812824/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/803815927","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/pull/5113#issuecomment-803815927","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/5113","id":803815927,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwMzgxNTkyNw==","user":{"login":"chengshiwen","id":4902714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MDI3MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4902714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengshiwen","html_url":"https://github.com/chengshiwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengshiwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengshiwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengshiwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengshiwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengshiwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengshiwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengshiwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengshiwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengshiwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-22T07:03:12Z","updated_at":"2021-03-22T07:05:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Could you show us the performance facts about the pressure on the database instead of opinions?
