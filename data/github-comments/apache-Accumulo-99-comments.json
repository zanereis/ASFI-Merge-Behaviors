The main issue is that the status for EC is cached for 1 minute. So when the page first loads if the coordinator was recently shut down then the api call of `/rest/ec` will still return a good status for a minute until the coordinator info is refreshed. Because of this the status page renders the tables and makes the table REST calls for data thinking that there is a compaction coordinator. The rest endpoints for the tables are then called and proceed to fail with a 500 error (Issue 2)\r\n2. Instead of returning no data or empty response the rest endpoints throw an IllegalStateException if the coordinator is down. This translates into a 500 error and is why the pop ups show up because the Ajax call had a server error. The rest endpoints on the manager page don't seem to throw a 500 error if the manager is down but these do.\r\n3. The EC page and manager page are a bit different with status checks. The manager page will check the status each time a refresh is done on a table to see if the manager is alive. If the manager is alive then it updates the page to show the window that it's down as described and hide the bottom table. The EC page only checks the status on first render of the page and only refreshed if you refresh the entire page. Status is not checked again if you click on one of the refresh buttons in the Compactors or Running Compactors table. So this would cause an error forever until the page is loaded again (due to the 500 error) even if the EC status updates after a minute.\r\n\r\nSo based on this I think we need to decide what we want to do. \r\n\r\nOne thing that should happen either way is status should always be checked on refreshes of the tables. Besides that we probably need to do one or more of the following to fix this:\r\n\r\n1. Don't cache the status or provide a way for an immediate refresh of status to see if the coordinator is alive.\r\n2. Don't return a 500 error when querying the endpoints for data on external compactions, just return something like an empty list, etc. This will prevent the error and just show an empty table and then eventually the status would catch up and we could show that it's down and hide the tables.\r\n3. Keep throwing the 500 error if the endpoints are hit and figure out a way for the JavaScript code to catch the error and show an empty table instead of the pop up, or maybe print a message but not an alert. Or on 500 error we just immediately take that to mean that the coordinator is down and show the down message and hide the tables, etc. Basically just some sort of better handling of the 500 error on the rest call until the cached status catches up so that the page knows the coordinator is down.\r\n\r\nNumber 3 seems like the best solution to me. Just figure out a way to handle the 500 error more gracefully until the server updates the cached status to show it's down. (And of course as I said make sure the refreshes check status first).\r\n\r\n@dlmarion and @ctubbsii thoughts?\r\n\r\nAlso, @DomGarguilo - Can you look at this too and see what you think about the best way to handle the issue? I saw that you worked a lot recently on the monitor including the status stuff for the manager page so you may have a better idea on how to fix it or know of something I'm not aware of as my JavaScript is pretty rusty. I'm wondering if there is something simple in the data tables to just better handle the failed Ajax call but I didn't get a chance to look into it yet. If you wanted to take a shot at fixing it feel free too otherwise I can get back to it probably Friday or next weekend.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1295895112/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1295902584","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/3057#issuecomment-1295902584","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/3057","id":1295902584,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5NPed4","user":{"login":"DomGarguilo","id":47725857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NzI1ODU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47725857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo","html_url":"https://github.com/DomGarguilo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-29T17:01:30Z","updated_at":"2022-10-29T17:01:30Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Also, @DomGarguilo - Can you look at this too and see what you think about the best way to handle the issue?\n\nSure thing 👍 ill take a look when I get a chance.

The logic to show the mentioned banner is in the freemarker code and I'm not exact sure how that works but from what it seems, the page needs to be refreshed in order for that if statement that shows/hides the banner to be reached again. We could work out a way for that logic to be moved into the javascript so that it can be updated as part of the pages `refresh()` but that should probably take place as part of a separate ticket.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1297499300/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1298313380","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/3056#issuecomment-1298313380","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/3056","id":1298313380,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5NYrCk","user":{"login":"cshannon","id":123009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzAwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon","html_url":"https://github.com/cshannon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-01T10:17:48Z","updated_at":"2022-11-01T10:17:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I pushed up the latest change with the new format.

Because of Eclipse upstream behavior quirks when handling formatting, it's probably going to be necessary to manipulate their xml configuration by importing into Eclipse, re-exporting it, then substituting any added values with Eclipse's default that may have gotten mangled in the import/export process. And then, we'll have to compare *that* resulting diff against our own config file to see what the actual differences are. It's also going to be very hard to interpret what these xml configuration items relate to in the Eclipse UI, or just how they affect formatting in general... because they are not documented by Eclipse anywhere. Some of the values are aren't even human-readable values... they actually represent a bit set, stored as a single integer value. It's all very complicated and annoying.\r\n\r\nI created #3066 to update our configuration to the Eclipse 2022-09 format, whose formatter code is what the formatter-maven-plugin version 2.21.0 runs (a version I just released today for this purpose... it was overdue for a release anyway). We should merge that PR first, then, manipulate the Google Style Guide configuration file to be up-to-date with Eclipse 2022-09 (and using Eclipse defaults for any missing entries), and *then* we can compare with our own. Sadly, I'm quite familiar with doing this... so I can either step you through it, or I can help with some of these bits. Feel free to reach out to me directly to get further on this.\r\n\r\nAs for the discussion earlier of when to apply the changes in order to reduce merge conflicts... there's no reason it can't be applied to all our currently maintained branches (or at least, any where we anticipate merge conflicts might occur due to formatting differences). I'm happy to help curate the application of the formatting to our branches to make the process smoother. But, we'll need to agree on *which* changes we want, which is really the decision we should focus on here.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I like the Google Style Guide as a basis, but I don't mind diverging from it where it makes sense. Right now, I'm not sure we diverge from it too much... so perhaps our current config is already sufficiently suitable?
