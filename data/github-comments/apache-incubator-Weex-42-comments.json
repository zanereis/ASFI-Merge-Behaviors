SIGSEGV的错误，一方面我是通过修改打包的abifliter： armabi 为armabi-v7架构，来避免此问题，至少实现了基本控件可以渲染，这是第一步。\r\n另一方面是，一旦我copy了之前版本的一个正常运行的页面尝试 在新版本weex环境中运行，就会遇到诸如weex_js_connection.cpp:192,server died，SIG: SIGSEGV的错误。\r\n本质上是以前版本能运行的部分代码不能够在新版本运行了，比如我用Vue对象来支持 eventbus 页面内父对子通信。在0.18可以，在0.26就报错，页面渲染失败，注释了此eventbus功能就能渲染正常。\r\n还有很多坑没踩，新版本很蛋疼的一点是，根据日志报错你找不到什么代码 有问题（抑或新版本不支持了），只能一行行的注释自己的旧版本能运行的代码，不停的编译跑起来看效果，才能判断大概是什么问题。\r\ndamn it。感觉比刚接入weex时，还要摸着石头过河 -
