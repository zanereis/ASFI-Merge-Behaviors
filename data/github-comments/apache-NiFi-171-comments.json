change set adjusts the behavior of `TestAttributesToCSV`, but it is does not address the problem described in the original version of the PR.\r\n\r\nThe this particular unit test class should remain unchanged, and it should continue to use the `assertAttributeEquals` method from `MockFlowFile`. If there is a problem with `assertAttributeEquals()`, then changes should be made to that method, and all impacted references should be updated. I realize that may involve changing other tests in addition to `TestAttributesToCSV`, but if that is necessary to correct the underlying behavior, that is a much better solution than changing individual tests to avoid using `assertAttributeEquals()`.\r\n\r\nAlthough the `NonDex` tool reports an issue, we have not observed indeterminate behavior in normal test execution.

You're adding the attribute to the original flow file but one could configure many dynamic properties with different queries and there could be many different relationships (one per query).

original queue but when the flow file goes to \"query\" queue and becomes a \"transformed\" flow file, I add the attribute with name of the \"query queue\".\r\n\r\nTo summarise:\r\n- if the flow file goes to failure, the failure queue name is put in the attribute.\r\n- if the flow file goes to original, the original queue is put in the attribute.\r\n- if the flow file goes to \"query\" queue, the query name is put in the attribute.\r\n\r\nI did this to copy what is done in RouteOnAttribute to have an attribute to use to factor out part of the process after the processor with a condition on

from my side, thanks for the update. As work is currently being done around minifi and c2 the tests will be touched for sure I wanted to ask what is your opinion of assertJ. I think it helps with assertion readability but if there are constraints around it that would be great to know.\r\nAlso wanted to ask that there is an explicit dependency on junit 4.13.2 in the minifi pom.xml. Can that be removed after this change?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1121254710/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1121278801","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6024#issuecomment-1121278801","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6024","id":1121278801,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5C1VtR","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-09T15:53:05Z","updated_at":"2022-05-09T15:53:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the feedback @bejancsaba!\r\n\r\nAs far as AssertJ, it is licensed under Apache License 2.0, so that's good. JUnit 5 included some improvements in terms of assertion capabilities, so I would recommend staying with it, given that no other modules currently use AssertJ.  Part of the effort in moving to JUnit 5 has involved bringing more consistency to tests, such as using static imports and replacing `fail()` assertions with `assertThrows()`. More complex assertions might be helpful to handle using AssertJ, but it could also create inconsistency in terms of different approaches. This seems like a good question to raise on the developer mailing list, or on the dev Slack channel.\r\n\r\nThanks for mentioning the JUnit 4 dependency in the MiNiFi Maven configuration, that can be removed, so I have pushed another commit to update pom.xml.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1121278801/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1121304259","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6026#issuecomment-1121304259","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6026","id":1121304259,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5C1b7D","user":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-09T16:15:35Z","updated_at":"2022-05-09T16:15:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 LGTM, will merge when the checks finish (the failing JDK 8 one is unrelated and appears to be intermittent)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1121304259/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1121414446","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6024#issuecomment-1121414446","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6024","id":1121414446,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5C120u","user":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-09T18:06:27Z","updated_at":"2022-05-09T18:06:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 LGTM, thanks for the upgrade!
