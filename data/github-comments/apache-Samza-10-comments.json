\r\n\r\nWhen fixing SAMZA-1638, I noticed that the container threadPool in AsyncRunLoop was not shutdown at all.\r\n\r\nContainer thread pool is used to run window, commit, timer tasks in ` AsyncRunLoop`.  This will cause problems in standalone in the following scenario:\r\n\r\n1. Due to a rebalance phase, `StreamProcessor` shuts down the `SamzaContainer`. \r\n2. `StreamProcessor` receives a new `JobModel` (v2) and starts the `SamzaContainer` again.\r\n3. Window, commit tasks from the unstopped container thread pool corresponding to  previous JobModel(v1) would still be running in the JVM.\r\n\r\nI think this can cause duplicate processing  depending upon number of window tasks scheduled in the container threadPool before `AsyncRunLoop` shutdown. \r\n\r\nPlease correct me if I'm missing something here.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/435973751/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/435973986","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/samza/pull/795#issuecomment-435973986","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/795","id":435973986,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNTk3Mzk4Ng==","user":{"login":"xinyuiscool","id":24738423,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzM4NDIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24738423?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool","html_url":"https://github.com/xinyuiscool","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-05T18:04:41Z","updated_at":"2018-11-05T18:04:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Does SamzaContainer.shutdownTask() shut them down?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/435973986/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/435993402","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/samza/pull/795#issuecomment-435993402","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/795","id":435993402,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNTk5MzQwMg==","user":{"login":"prateekm","id":1085859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODU4NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm","html_url":"https://github.com/prateekm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-05T18:59:09Z","updated_at":"2018-11-05T18:59:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@shanthoosh I understand, was just asking if you noticed any specific issues that lead to this change.
