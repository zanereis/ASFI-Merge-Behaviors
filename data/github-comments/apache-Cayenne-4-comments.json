Moreover, I don't even like the whole marker thing in the paths and hope to get rid of the single marker there is now.\r\n\r\nGiving this feature a bit thought, I think we need to add this information explicitly to the model and rewrite all the flattened ids logic to use it.\r\n\r\nHere's some ideas I have.\r\nWe could keep more information in the `ClassDescriptor` instead of just path -> entity pairs:\r\n```java\r\nclass AdditionalEntityDescriptor {\r\n    CayennePath path;\r\n    DbEntity entity;\r\n    boolean noDelete;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd keep a reference to it (maybe we could get away by just looking it up by path?) when we are tracking flattened ids in the `ObjectStore`:\r\n```java\r\nclass FlattenedId {\r\n    AdditionalEntityDescriptor flattenedEntity;\r\n    ObjectId id;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cayenne/issues/comments/2110639172/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cayenne/issues/comments/2114928299","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cayenne/pull/615#issuecomment-2114928299","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cayenne/issues/615","id":2114928299,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmDs5-Dz6r","user":{"login":"Jugen","id":5031427,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMzE0Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5031427?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jugen","html_url":"https://github.com/Jugen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jugen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jugen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jugen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jugen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jugen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jugen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jugen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jugen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jugen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-16T11:05:10Z","updated_at":"2024-05-16T11:05:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yeah,

`AdditionalEntityDescriptor` class.\r\n\r\nI initially also tried incorporating `FlattenedId` but ran into problems in `ArcValuesCreationHandler`._processFlattenedPath_ and in `ReplacementIdVisitor`._visitInsert_ (both in package access/flush) where new FlattenedId object's need to be created, but there's no way (I know of) to get to the needed `AdditionalEntityDescriptor` for the noDelete flag.\r\n\r\nAnyway using just `AdditionalEntityDescriptor` on its own turned out much cleaner and
