The spark sql use the `SqlKeyGenerator` which is a sub-class of `ComplexKeyGenerator` to generated record key which will add the column name to the record key. While the `SimpleKeyGenerator` will not do that. So we should keep the behavior the same for `ComplexKeyGenerator` and `SimpleKeyGenerator`.\r\n\r\nsorry, I don't get you. I understand SqlKeyGenerator extends from ComplexKeyGen. but why do we need to keep the same for SimpleKeyGen? We should not add any field prefix for SimpleKeyGen. If not, no updates will work for an existing table.

I am using the default file size. I tried decreasing it to 60 MB but that increased the write time by 2-4 mins. \r\n2. Avg record size is 1 KB to 2 KB. \r\n3. I did not specify this for most of my write experiments. The default value is 500000.  In some of the experiments, I tried reducing it to 50000. This did not have a significant effect on the write time. \r\n4. I have a timestamp field in my record key and tried to have it as the prefix of the record key. It takes 2.2 mins more in the \"prune by ranges\" stage so I turned it off. I guess it is because some of the packets may arrive late to our system and the timestamp is of the packet instead of the timestamp when it arrived. \r\n5. The data contains negligible updates (99> % inserts and <1% updates). \r\n6. Yes small size creates new files for inserts. It decreases the write time in the first few commits and then it takes more time as the commits increase. \r\n\r\nI have experimented with a lot of things but can't seem to get the time of a single commit writing 100k rows to less than 10 mins. The weird part is if I write 20-30 commits there are 2-3 commits which take really less time (1-4 mins).    \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/892413100/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/892446743","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/3394#issuecomment-892446743","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3394","id":892446743,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM41MagX","user":{"login":"dmenin","id":8372967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNzI5Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8372967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmenin","html_url":"https://github.com/dmenin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmenin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmenin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmenin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmenin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmenin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmenin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmenin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmenin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmenin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-04T07:52:59Z","updated_at":"2021-08-04T07:52:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi Sivabalan,\r\nThanks very much for taking the time to reply.\r\nA few questions:\r\n\r\n1) the config value you linked seem to only applies to GLOBAL_BLOOM index. I am using GLOBAL_SIMPLE, so I don’t think it applies to my case.\r\n\r\n2) You mentioned “preCombine”. My understanding is that preCombine works before the write…. If I have two records with the same key, preCombine will choose the one with largest value and the “submit” the insert command – so it shouldn’t affect the calculations between input data and existing data, correct? Since we only have 1 new row on the insert, it seems that preCombine is also not relevant in this case.\r\n\r\nCould you clarify further,

The spark sql use the `SqlKeyGenerator` which is a sub-class of `ComplexKeyGenerator` to generated record key which will add the column name to the record key. While the `SimpleKeyGenerator` will not do that. So we should keep the behavior the same for `ComplexKeyGenerator` and `SimpleKeyGenerator`.\r\n> \r\n> sorry, I don't get you. I understand SqlKeyGenerator extends from ComplexKeyGen. but why do we need to keep the same for SimpleKeyGen? We should not add any field prefix for SimpleKeyGen. If not, no updates will work for an existing table.\r\n\r\nHi @nsivabalan , Have solved the record key not matched issue.

The spark sql use the `SqlKeyGenerator` which is a sub-class of `ComplexKeyGenerator` to generated record key which will add the column name to the record key. While the `SimpleKeyGenerator` will not do that. So we should keep the behavior the same for `ComplexKeyGenerator` and `SimpleKeyGenerator`.\r\n> > \r\n> > \r\n> > sorry, I don't get you. I understand SqlKeyGenerator extends from ComplexKeyGen. but why do we need to keep the same for SimpleKeyGen? We should not add any field prefix for SimpleKeyGen. If not, no updates will work for an existing table.\r\n> \r\n> Hi @nsivabalan , Have solved the record key not matched issue. Please take a test again~\r\n\r\n@pengzhiwei2018 I tested the patch. I can see the column names are no longer being prefixed. Updates and deletes by record key is working fine now. However., the uri encoding of partition path is still an issue. For example, I did an insert to an existing partition. The insert was successful but it created a new partition as below:\r\n```\r\ninsert into hudi_trips_cow values(1.0, 2.0, \"driver_2\", 3.0, 4.0, 100.0, \"rider_2\", 12345,

The spark sql use the `SqlKeyGenerator` which is a sub-class of `ComplexKeyGenerator` to generated record key which will add the column name to the record key. While the `SimpleKeyGenerator` will not do that. So we should keep the behavior the same for `ComplexKeyGenerator` and `SimpleKeyGenerator`.\r\n> > > \r\n> > > \r\n> > > sorry, I don't get you. I understand SqlKeyGenerator extends from ComplexKeyGen. but why do we need to keep the same for SimpleKeyGen? We should not add any field prefix for SimpleKeyGen. If not, no updates will work for an existing table.\r\n> > \r\n> > \r\n> > Hi @nsivabalan , Have solved the record key not matched issue. Please take a test again~\r\n> \r\n> @pengzhiwei2018 I tested the patch. I can see the column names are no longer being prefixed. Updates and deletes by record key is working fine now. However., the uri encoding of partition path is still an issue. For example, I did an insert to an existing partition. The insert was successful but it created a new partition as below:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> insert into hudi_trips_cow values(1.0, 2.0, \"driver_2\", 3.0, 4.0, 100.0, \"rider_2\", 12345, \"765544i-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000\", \"americas/united_states/san_francisco/\");\r\n> \r\n> % ls -l /private/tmp/hudi_trips_cow\r\n> total 0\r\n> drwxr-xr-x  4 sagars  wheel  128 Aug  4 16:49 americas\r\n> drwxr-xr-x  6 sagars  wheel  192 Aug  4 16:50 americas%2Funited_states%2Fsan_francisco%2F\r\n> drwxr-xr-x  3 sagars  wheel   96 Aug  4 16:49 asia\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nHi @codope , can you drop the table and create again with the latest code of this patch?  I am afraid this happen because you create the table by the old code of the patch. I have fix this issue in the latest .","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/893180101/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/893193914","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/3280#issuecomment-893193914","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3280","id":893193914,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM41PQ66","user":{"login":"liujinhui1994","id":25769285,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzY5Mjg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25769285?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujinhui1994","html_url":"https://github.com/liujinhui1994","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujinhui1994/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujinhui1994/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujinhui1994/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujinhui1994/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujinhui1994/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujinhui1994/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujinhui1994/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujinhui1994/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujinhui1994/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-05T06:12:34Z","updated_at":"2021-08-05T06:12:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I re-synchronized the latest code this time, and now it works.
