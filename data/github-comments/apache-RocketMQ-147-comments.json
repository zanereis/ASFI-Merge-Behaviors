I think that HA switching is necessary when there are fatal I/O issues (such as disk corruption or abnormally high I/O). However, we also need to give users a optional switch because if the disk is normal but the traffic itself is large, resulting in continuously high I/O, the HA switch will further affect the stability of the cluster. In addition, HA switching standards and threshold settings is very challenging.\r\n\r\nyes, let's clarify the HA switching rules and triggering thresholds.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1484602643/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1484627768","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/6468#issuecomment-1484627768","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/6468","id":1484627768,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl85YfZ84","user":{"login":"ShannonDing","id":16487356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDg3MzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16487356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShannonDing","html_url":"https://github.com/ShannonDing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShannonDing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShannonDing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShannonDing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShannonDing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShannonDing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShannonDing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShannonDing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShannonDing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShannonDing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-27T07:16:55Z","updated_at":"2023-03-27T07:16:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> I think it's a good idea to implement a health check endpoint on the broker side. Then the brokerIsActive is no longer check the heartbeat,but invoke the endpoint. the endpoint is as simple as the heartbeat, just return the status health or not. When elect the broker from the syncStateSet, it should also invoke it to check whether the broker is health before can be elelct as Master.\r\n> \r\n> > At this point, the broker may reconnect quickly. Is it necessary to do a HA switching?\r\n> \r\n> IMO, it't not neccssary. what more, The current controller has three places to trigger the election:\r\n> \r\n> 1. The broker channel closed.\r\n> 2. The BrokerHeartbeatManager scanNotActiveBroker\r\n> 3. The DLedgerController scanInactiveMasterAndTriggerReelect.\r\n> \r\n> I think just the scanInactiveMasterAndTriggerReelect is enough, In the current implementation, it is easy to have a concurrent election problem.\r\n\r\nIn fact, what we hope is that when the master fails, re-election can be triggered timely and quickly to ensure a timely switchover between the master and slave nodes. However, we don't want to trigger frequent HA switches due to small jitters.\r\nTherefore, it is necessary to do regularly scanning node status actively and  do a passively trigger re-election by node abnormal events. What is important is that we may need to clarify the threshold and conditions for HA switch, as well as the timing for triggering re-election.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1484627768/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1484642385","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/6341#issuecomment-1484642385","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/6341","id":1484642385,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl85YfdhR","user":{"login":"github-advanced-security[bot]","id":62310815,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NjIzMTA4MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/57789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-advanced-security%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-advanced-security","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-advanced-security%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-advanced-security%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-advanced-security%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-advanced-security%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-advanced-security%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-advanced-security%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-advanced-security%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-advanced-security%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-advanced-security%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-27T07:29:25Z","updated_at":"2023-03-27T07:29:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"You have successfully added a new CodeQL configuration `.github/workflows/codeql_analysis.yml:CodeQL-Build`.
