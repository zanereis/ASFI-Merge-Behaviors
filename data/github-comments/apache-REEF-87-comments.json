I forgot to finalize this before heading on vacation.\r\n\r\nNow, to answer your question, @tcNickolas, this regex does differentiate between 0.15.0 and 0.15.0.0 However, it leaves the last number unchanged, and simply flips the major number and first minor number (e.g. with an input of \"0.17.0\", 0.16.0.0 => 0.17.0.0, 0.16.1.0 => 0.17.0.0, 0.16.0.1 => 0.17.0.1 )\r\n\r\n@motus I like your regex here, and I think it's a simpler way to do it, but I'd rather keep the simplistic loop & replace that was there originally because it's easier to read. The more complex regex requires a bit more regular expressions skill than I think we should assume of a general reader. -- Your choice though. I'd be happy to swap for the more complex statement if you prefer the succinctness.\r\n\r\n(rebase done, conflicts addressed; waiting for a new build.)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/327516749/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/327607466","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/1374#issuecomment-327607466","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/1374","id":327607466,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNzYwNzQ2Ng==","user":{"login":"motus","id":31380,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMzgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31380?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/motus","html_url":"https://github.com/motus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/motus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/motus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/motus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/motus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/motus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/motus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/motus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/motus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/motus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-06T20:44:25Z","updated_at":"2017-09-06T20:44:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I have a question, though - why do we have a PR with interfaces only?
