Hector, thanks for your interest in extending `Lookup` API. It is a core NetBeans API and I am still fond of creating it. That's one aspect.\r\n\r\nThe other one is that I don't understand why Java has `Optional`!? I believe I am not the only one. Java community seems to be divided into `Optional` believers and haters. I guess I fall rather into the latter category. To make it short, I have nothing against the believers using:\r\n```java\r\nOptional.of(context.lookup(AClass.class)).orElse(...)\r\n```\r\nbut adding new method into `Lookup` and writing:\r\n```java\r\ncontext.lookupOptional(AClass.class).orElse(...)\r\n```\r\nisn't my cup of tea. Adding a new method into subclassable class isn't for free. Moreover please notice that both variants of the code are actually almost of the same length - e.g. I don't see any benefits in adding new `lookupOptional` method into `Lookup`.\r\n\r\nThat said, I am not going to veto the change, if there are at least three supporters of `Optional` in the `Lookup`. E.g. I am going to continue with the review, assuming you'll find enough supporters to overcome my own dislike of `Optional`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/609425745/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/609433050","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2064#issuecomment-609433050","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/2064","id":609433050,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwOTQzMzA1MA==","user":{"login":"lkishalmi","id":1381701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODE3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1381701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi","html_url":"https://github.com/lkishalmi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-05T15:18:22Z","updated_at":"2020-04-05T15:18:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Just
