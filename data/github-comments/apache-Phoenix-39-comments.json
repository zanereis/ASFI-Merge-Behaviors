I think now i understand what you are retrying to say. Now that i look at the metric name again i think we should not consider anything special about this metric if table is tx or non tx. If we ever need special cases we can create special metric with some prefix or suffix indicating it is for tx tables. \r\n\r\nAlso  if  we look at the code again  ideally a delete statement should not be part of a batch else(we can talk about it some other day). The problem with deletes combing with upsert of having multiple  delete in same batch is as below\r\n- If we have  a batch with two delete statements and if one statement failed we will get a number saying that x num of deletes failed. But we don't know if it was first delete stmt or second or both failed.

Puts and Deletes will be passed through to normal handling as required. Phoenix rewrites Increments on the sequence table into Puts to same and submits them by Region#batchMutate, which would set up a cycle with preBatchMutate otherwise, I believe.\r\n- Retains existing hooks for preAppend and preIncrement that are necessary for intercepting other APIs.\r\n- Refactors most logic to reusable private methods.
