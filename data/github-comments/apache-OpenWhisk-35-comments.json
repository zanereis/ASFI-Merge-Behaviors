We don't expect a lot of load here but still.\n- Massive overhead. The invoker will have to keep track of all those loopback files. It will need to create them, mkfs them, mount them and clean them up during gc later.\n- Performance loss to actually make the files (dd-ing alone takes about 1.5 secs on top of the docker run command. 0.8 secs for 512M files)\n\nIn contrast, tmpfs costs next to no time to create and is immediately destroyed when the container ends.
