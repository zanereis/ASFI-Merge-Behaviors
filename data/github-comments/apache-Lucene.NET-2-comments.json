I found that if you set file to null before entering the using's scope and then, inside it, change it to reference a File object, it does not dispose the resources correctly (namely, it does not close the file we are opening).

To make sure that this locking works we need the \"canonical name\" of the directory, otherwise it is not guaranteed that locking really works.\nIf this is not an issue on windows (if you lock a file, the file lock is visible to the same process, too), then you won't need that.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/72958293/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/72975784","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/74#issuecomment-72975784","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/74","id":72975784,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyOTc1Nzg0","user":{"login":"laimis","id":911757,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMTc1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/911757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis","html_url":"https://github.com/laimis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-05T01:10:54Z","updated_at":"2015-02-05T01:10:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Cool, yeah it looked strange.

this is mainly why I haven't pulled this in yet.

The Util's one is much more referenced.\n- The only PQ's methods invoked from TopTermsRewrite are: PriorityQueue(int capacity), PriorityQueue(), T Peek(), T Poll() (dequeueing without failure if the PQ is empty), bool Offer(T item) (insertion) and int Count. All of these methods are provided by Util's PQ, with the exception of Poll which could be added with little effort.\n\nAll this facts make me think that we should replace the Support's duplicate by the Util's preexisting PQ. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/73944065/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/73944835","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/92#issuecomment-73944835","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/92","id":73944835,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczOTQ0ODM1","user":{"login":"guidotag","id":6154153,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNTQxNTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6154153?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guidotag","html_url":"https://github.com/guidotag","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guidotag/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guidotag/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guidotag/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guidotag/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guidotag/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guidotag/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guidotag/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guidotag/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guidotag/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-11T19:17:19Z","updated_at":"2015-02-11T19:17:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"One more thing: The Util's one has some unit tests while the other one, as you remarked previously, does not.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/73944835/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/73962107","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/95#issuecomment-73962107","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/95","id":73962107,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczOTYyMTA3","user":{"login":"synhershko","id":212252,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjI1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/212252?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko","html_url":"https://github.com/synhershko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-11T20:51:01Z","updated_at":"2015-02-11T20:51:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Chand2048 any reason why you closed this PR then ?

I finished reviewing Util's PQ and creating some more unit tests.\nI could change this PQ to require a comparer in the constructors, rather than needing to inherit and overwrite the LessThan method, but, as you imagine, this would require changes all over the code.\n\nThis way of defining comparers via inheriting is flexible enough to allow two different comparers for the same data type, though you'll need to create two different PQ type's which is much less natural than just creating two different comparer functions and using them with the same generic PQ.\n\nPassing a comparer seems a much better (and natural) approach to me, but since this would require a lot of changes I'd like to discuss it before doing any

As elements are added to a priority queue, its capacity grows automatically.\" So yes, it has an internal resizing procedure.\n\nIn the TopTermRewrite class it is not clear what size we will need at most:\n\nhttps://github.com/guidotag/lucenenet/commit/9428451c8ee87b39efeb2c39b94eb153067a066e#diff-226e1a7768fe596cf640cfef43c6f60fL74\n\nso we need the representation's size to grow dynamically.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/75101543/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/75105480","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/103#issuecomment-75105480","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/103","id":75105480,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1MTA1NDgw","user":{"login":"guidotag","id":6154153,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNTQxNTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6154153?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guidotag","html_url":"https://github.com/guidotag","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guidotag/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guidotag/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guidotag/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guidotag/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guidotag/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guidotag/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guidotag/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guidotag/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guidotag/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-19T18:15:54Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T18:15:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"In Lucene, TopTermRewrite is implemented the same way, relying on the dynamic capacity:\n\nfinal PriorityQueue<ScoreTerm> stQueue = new PriorityQueue<ScoreTerm>();\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/75105480/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/75110511","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/103#issuecomment-75110511","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/103","id":75110511,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1MTEwNTEx","user":{"login":"synhershko","id":212252,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjI1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/212252?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko","html_url":"https://github.com/synhershko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-19T18:43:11Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T18:43:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I must be missing something -
