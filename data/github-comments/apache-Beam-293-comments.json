`choices` feature of argparse was not working. The reason is that we always override the `type` of an option to be `StaticValueProvider`, via this line: \r\n`[kwargs['type'] = _static_value_provider_of(value_type)]`,\r\nand the way `choices` works is to compare user input with type applied to the elements in the `choices` list. For example, if the `choices` are ['a', 'b'], and user inputs 'a', internally, the check will be on `if StaticValueProvider(str, 'a') in ['a', 'b']`, which obviously will fail. This change makes sure that a `StaticValueProvider` can be compared with un underlying value.
