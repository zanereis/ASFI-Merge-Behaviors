By reviewing/approving/voting-on each aspect in sequence, we will have a clear idea of where the PR is in process, and that will make it easier to move PR forward to final merge (if that's what we want to do).  The aspects I see are:\n- Feature set -- is this the kind of security interface we want to put in Zeppelin?\n- Architecture -- Is this (shiro) how we want to implement security?\n- Does it work? \n- Do we have adequate tests to be able to support and maintain it?\n- Is it adequately documented that people will be able to use it?\n\nThe reason I propose a more formal process is that this PR has been sitting here for 8 months now.  With that, and with some 82 (!!!) commits, a more structured approach seems like the best way to resolve this PR (one way or the other).  \n\n(In full disclosure -- My only view about this is that since its security-related, it needs to have _mounds_ of tests to make sure the security doesn't get compromised by later commits.)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/167490159/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/167496373","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/574#issuecomment-167496373","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/574","id":167496373,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NzQ5NjM3Mw==","user":{"login":"Leemoonsoo","id":1540981,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDA5ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1540981?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo","html_url":"https://github.com/Leemoonsoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-28T06:53:39Z","updated_at":"2015-12-28T06:53:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@HeartSaVioR

With a basic set of test-cases, which ensure the changes are non-breaking. \n- Front-end changes, which include -display of username, accepting header parameters of principal, ticket. \n- Subsequently, addition of more test cases, before we call it done. Till such time we keep the feature as default off. \n  (Each of the above steps will have user guides/documentation). \n\nIf the committers can provide some bandwidth for review, I'm willing to make the above changes + documentation. \n\nAs side notes:\n- We will need to include the notion of proxy-users at sometime, which enable command execution of secure spark/hdfs clusters\n- Subsequently, there will have to be a mechanism of how to provide default access to the cluster users, either by way of import of AD/LDAP users, through some auth_to_local kind of rules. \n\nI'm of the opinion that Shiro is a good strategy, larger projects such as https://knox.apache.org/ use Shiro, for HDFS Api gateway security. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/167797523/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/167809403","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/53#issuecomment-167809403","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/53","id":167809403,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NzgwOTQwMw==","user":{"login":"hayssams","id":2473992,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzM5OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2473992?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hayssams","html_url":"https://github.com/hayssams","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hayssams/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hayssams/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hayssams/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hayssams/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hayssams/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hayssams/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hayssams/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hayssams/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hayssams/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-29T15:22:44Z","updated_at":"2015-12-29T15:22:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@elbamos @jongyoul @rconline \nLet me write down the whole set of changes I've made and how they may be split in my view in smaller commits.\nThere are also different strategies in using shiro.

Should we rely on the ThreadLocal pattern or explicitly pass the username in function calls or should we use a different approach ?\n\nOnce we decide how to move on, I think that we will be able to focus on the implementation details and how this PR should be split.\n\nWaiting to hear from you.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/168004206/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/168004929","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/361#issuecomment-168004929","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/361","id":168004929,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2ODAwNDkyOQ==","user":{"login":"jongyoul","id":3612566,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTI1NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3612566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul","html_url":"https://github.com/jongyoul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-30T14:05:23Z","updated_at":"2015-12-30T14:05:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@vrajat Thanks for taking an interest in this issue and being willing to contribute your code. I have a plan to merge several jdbc-like interpreters until 0.6.0-incubating. For that, I'm trying to find PRs related JDBC and contacting contributors to track their contribution. Now, I'm trying to contact the contributor of #211 and this PR is next candidate if I'm not contacting that contributor. And I also think this implementation looks the best, but I think the former contribution should be tracked and accepted at first if that contributor is still willing to give his/her time to contribute. I hope you understand my thoughts and plans. Finally, I will merge additional features of #455 and #517 into jdbc implementation. Please wait a moment and Thank you again for concerning about this issue.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/168004929/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/168008003","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/361#issuecomment-168008003","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/361","id":168008003,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2ODAwODAwMw==","user":{"login":"jongyoul","id":3612566,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTI1NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3612566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul","html_url":"https://github.com/jongyoul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-30T14:17:10Z","updated_at":"2015-12-30T14:17:10Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@vrajat And I also think JDBC interpreter supports all kind of JDBC drivers.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/168008003/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/168011185","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/583#issuecomment-168011185","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/583","id":168011185,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2ODAxMTE4NQ==","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-30T14:29:04Z","updated_at":"2015-12-30T14:29:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM.
