Improved this problem in 1.0.4\r\n\r\n2, look at a Task log and Worker log, you should be able to see the problem\r\n3, or in the test environment DEBUG\r\n\r\n\r\n1，如果是YARN任务，我们的判断依据是SHELL脚本退出之后，首先判断SHELL脚本的返回码是否是成功，如果成功，则判断YARN任务是否成功，这时分为（成功，失败，KILL）。不过还有一种状态就是Running，如果是Running的化，对于版本的判断是直接失败。在1.0.4中改进了这个问题\r\n\r\n2，自己看一个Task 日志和Worker 日志，应该能看出问题\r\n3，或者在测试环境DEBUG一下","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/519758054/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/519759123","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/514#issuecomment-519759123","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/514","id":519759123,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxOTc1OTEyMw==","user":{"login":"gk0916","id":29849547,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODQ5NTQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29849547?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gk0916","html_url":"https://github.com/gk0916","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gk0916/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gk0916/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gk0916/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gk0916/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gk0916/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gk0916/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gk0916/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gk0916/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gk0916/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-09T03:00:40Z","updated_at":"2019-08-09T03:00:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"+1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/519759123/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/519760776","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/679#issuecomment-519760776","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/679","id":519760776,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxOTc2MDc3Ng==","user":{"login":"boandai","id":48329107,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MzI5MTA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48329107?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/boandai","html_url":"https://github.com/boandai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boandai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boandai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boandai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boandai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boandai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boandai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boandai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boandai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boandai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-09T03:11:00Z","updated_at":"2019-08-09T03:11:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Baoqi

任务插件化设计\r\n\r\n### 自定义任务\r\n\r\n    一个自定义任务应该由三部分组成。configuration.xml和、metainfo.xml和基于AbstractTask实现的实现类XXXTask。\r\n\r\n    1. XXXTask是基于AbstractTask的实现类，实现了Task的相\b关接口，系统在执行该任务时实际上是通过反射来实例\b化该任务，然后调用执行方法。\r\n\r\n    2. configuration.xml文件主要用来描述该自定义任务类型的一些自定义的配置参数。注意，每个任务都会有一些通用参数，比如任务的名称，是否可重试，失败是否要告警，使用的资源队列等。这些参数是整个系统级别的，自定义\b任务是无法对这些参数做修改和定义的。\r\n\r\n    3.metainfo.xml文件，该文件里定义该任务类型的核心信息。\r\n\r\n#### AbstractTask的接口定义\r\n\r\n\r\n#### metainfo.xml定义\r\n\r\n**task_type_name** : 自定义任务的名称，比如MR任务，SPARK任务等，这个名称会显示在流程定义是左侧可选择的任务类型列表中。\r\n\r\n**classpath** : 自定义任务的实现类的路径，任务的执行器会使用该路径反射实例化具体的实现类，然后运行该实现类中的run方法。\r\n\r\n#### configuration.xml定义\r\n\r\n**name** : 参数的名称\r\n**value** : 参数的默认值\r\n**type** : 参数的类型，可以为INPUT,INPUT_LIST,SELECT,TEXTAREA,KV,RADIO.\r\n\r\nINPUT:前端页面会将INPUT类型的参数以表单元素input渲染。\r\nINPUT_LIST:前端页面会先渲染一个input，然后放上一个“+”号，点击加号后可以添加多个input。\r\nKV:前端会渲染出左右两个input，左边是key，右边是该key的值，并且可以通过\"+\"号增加kv对。\r\n\r\n\r\n### 加载自定义任务\r\n\r\n自定义任务开发完成后打包上传到服务器，系统会加载该任务，加载的过程中会从metainfo.xml和configuration.xml中读取相关的信息，并写“任务类型定义表中”\r\n\r\n任务类型定义表设计如下：\r\n\r\n\bID\r\n任务类型名称\r\n任务的classpath\r\n任务的自定义参数\r\n\r\n### 流程定义模块\r\n\r\n任务插件化，就要求在流程定义模块，可选择的任务类型列表应该从“任务类型定义表”中读取。然后每个任务在拖入设计界面时，该任务的配置界面中的参数除了系统默认参数，其它自定义参数都应该根据“任务的自定义参数”在页面中渲染。这样可以做到前端不需要专门为每个自己定义任务做单独的任务配置页面。\r\n\r\n### 流程保存\r\n\r\n当用户在页面上选择任务类型，并根据需要填写参数完成任务配置并保存时，需要将该任务节点信息保存到“任务节点定义表”中。在该表中保存了该任务节点的ID,任务节点对应的任务类型ID,任务节点名称,任务节点的配置参数（页面上的各个参数的参数名和值）。\r\n\r\n任务节点定义表设计如下：\r\n\r\nID\r\n任务类型ID\r\n任务节点名称\r\n任务参数\r\n\r\n### 流程执行\r\n\r\n流程执行时，任务执行器会根据“任务节点ID”从“任务节点定义表”中找到该任务的具体定义信息，根据“任务类型ID”可以从“任务类型定义表”中找到classpath然后反射实例化该类并执行run方法。\r\n\r\nAbstractTask类中提供getTaskVariables方法，获取到该任务的系统参数和自定义参数。在run方法中可以通过调用该方法获取到参数和值。\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/520310443/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/520310572","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/pull/687#issuecomment-520310572","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/687","id":520310572,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMDMxMDU3Mg==","user":{"login":"lenboo","id":29528966,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NTI4OTY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29528966?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lenboo","html_url":"https://github.com/lenboo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lenboo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lenboo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lenboo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lenboo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lenboo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lenboo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lenboo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lenboo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lenboo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-12T06:26:22Z","updated_at":"2019-08-12T06:26:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Refactor
