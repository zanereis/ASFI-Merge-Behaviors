I have no idea why  use  `toLowerCase()` for logicTable in class `TableRuleConfiguration`.   `TableRuleConfiguration` is initialized  before `TableRule`, but  the `TableRule`  \r\nhas already processed  logicTable to lower case.  This  is  repeated!    \r\n```\r\npublic TableRule(final TableRuleConfiguration tableRuleConfig, final ShardingDataSourceNames shardingDataSourceNames, final String defaultGenerateKeyColumn) {\r\n        logicTable = tableRuleConfig.getLogicTable().toLowerCase();\r\n        List<String> dataNodes = new InlineExpressionParser(tableRuleConfig.getActualDataNodes()).splitAndEvaluate();\r\n        dataNodeIndexMap = new HashMap<>(dataNodes.size(), 1);\r\n        actualDataNodes = isEmptyDataNodes(dataNodes)\r\n            ? generateDataNodes(tableRuleConfig.getLogicTable(), shardingDataSourceNames.getDataSourceNames()) : generateDataNodes(dataNodes, shardingDataSourceNames.getDataSourceNames());\r\n        actualTables = getActualTables();\r\n        databaseShardingStrategy = null == tableRuleConfig.getDatabaseShardingStrategyConfig() ? null : ShardingStrategyFactory.newInstance(tableRuleConfig.getDatabaseShardingStrategyConfig());\r\n        tableShardingStrategy = null == tableRuleConfig.getTableShardingStrategyConfig() ? null : ShardingStrategyFactory.newInstance(tableRuleConfig.getTableShardingStrategyConfig());\r\n        generateKeyColumn = getGenerateKeyColumn(tableRuleConfig.getKeyGeneratorConfig(), defaultGenerateKeyColumn);\r\n        shardingKeyGenerator = containsKeyGeneratorConfiguration(tableRuleConfig)\r\n                ? new ShardingKeyGeneratorServiceLoader().newService(tableRuleConfig.getKeyGeneratorConfig().getType(), tableRuleConfig.getKeyGeneratorConfig().getProperties()) : null;\r\n        checkRule(dataNodes);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n```\r\npublic TableRuleConfiguration(final String logicTable, final String actualDataNodes) {\r\n        Preconditions.checkArgument(!Strings.isNullOrEmpty(logicTable), \"LogicTable is required.\");\r\n        this.logicTable = logicTable.toLowerCase();\r\n        this.actualDataNodes = actualDataNodes;\r\n    }\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/570143330/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/570167370","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/pull/3844#issuecomment-570167370","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/3844","id":570167370,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MDE2NzM3MA==","user":{"login":"HongJinFeng","id":33616750,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNjE2NzUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33616750?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HongJinFeng","html_url":"https://github.com/HongJinFeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HongJinFeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HongJinFeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HongJinFeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HongJinFeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HongJinFeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HongJinFeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HongJinFeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HongJinFeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HongJinFeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-02T10:21:44Z","updated_at":"2020-01-02T10:21:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@haetao Thanks for review.
