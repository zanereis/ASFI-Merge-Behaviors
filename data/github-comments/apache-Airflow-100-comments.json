However, since the state change happens in a separate thread, we are not sure when it happens. If we assume that the state has already been changed, we will be wrong most of the time. So, the local process keeps a variable called `is_running`, which is set to True iff the heartbeat sees the task in the running state. However, it may never see the task in the running state since it polls the DB (not receives events). \r\n\r\nAn example is that a task could be run, and the state could be cleared in the UI before it heartbeats. Now, is_running will never change to True, and the local process will never do the state check. Thus, in this case, the state will be cleared, but the task will continue to run indefinitely.\r\n\r\nThe other real solution is interprocess communication which is kind of messy, especially when we have different layers due to bash and such. Realistically, the heartbeat process should just be in a multiprocessing thing, but it's a bit hard to refactor now, so if we do decide to go on that route eventually, this is a good first step. This solution of putting the state checks into local is the smallest refactor that doesn't become too large. It's feasible to refactor more of this later, but it is definitely too much for 1 PR, and has questionable value in my opinion.
