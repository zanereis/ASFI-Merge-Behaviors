This would mean, that we could not release the plugin from Apache NetBeans.\r\n\r\nAs somebody that doesn't even do JavaEE and doesn't even care about any particular web server, let alone JBoss or Wildfly, my angle here is:\r\n\r\n1. How can we add Wildfly back to the official NetBeans tree so it gets released to all the users.\r\n2. How can we make it easy so older JBoss / Wildfly versions with problematic schemas are supported for users.\r\n\r\nThe answer to 1. seems easy: we just don't include the old schemas and we re-add the plugin to NetBeans using only the schemas that are acceptable (under an Apache 2.0 license, or whatever).\r\n\r\nFor an answer to 2 we have to get creative, the same way we did it for nb-javac and other situations. My idea is that a 2nd \"companion\" plugin could be added perhaps to the plugin portal. This 2nd plugin would register \"somewhere\" (if it's just schema, perhaps in a layer file, if it's also generated code then some sort of service in the lookup) the old stuff which the Wildfly plugin would pick up and expand its support to all versions.\r\n\r\nIn the end, maybe this PR shouldn't even have to fix both 1 and 2. I think just getting 1 would be progress.\r\n\r\nSo how about @ehsavoie just deletes the license-wise non-compliant schemas and updates the PR? Then we have a PR that is acceptable and we can move the plugin from contrib/ back into NetBeans. Later on @ehsavoie can make a PR for whatever hooks are necessary for the companion plugin.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/598345657/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/598363000","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1986#issuecomment-598363000","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/1986","id":598363000,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5ODM2MzAwMA==","user":{"login":"oyarzun","id":2364606,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjQ2MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2364606?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oyarzun","html_url":"https://github.com/oyarzun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oyarzun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oyarzun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oyarzun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oyarzun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oyarzun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oyarzun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oyarzun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oyarzun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oyarzun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-12T18:58:25Z","updated_at":"2020-03-12T18:58:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ebarboni I've created another PR #2017 to dynamically get the latest nbm-maven-plugin version.

I first put this together because @geertjanw's PR6/PR8 had been around for several months. It's a backup so that NetBeans could ship with working archetypes in NewProject list just in case.  The archetype I put together has basically two changes from the **current** openjfx archetypes:\r\n\r\n1. pom executions for run and debug which came from @jperedadnr [at StackOveflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56197372/i-cant-debug-an-application-using-netbeans-11-with-javafx-12) slightly modified so that NetBeans could provide the jpda.address. It also appeared in an [openjfx-docs issue](https://github.com/openjfx/openjfx-docs/issues/100)\r\n2. nbactions.xml which also comes from @jperedadnr comments\r\n\r\nIt's true I did not issue a PR to [original archetypes](https://github.com/openjfx/javafx-maven-archetypes/) for them to accept nbactions.xml; I believed what I read in other comments that they would not accept NetBeans specific stuff.
