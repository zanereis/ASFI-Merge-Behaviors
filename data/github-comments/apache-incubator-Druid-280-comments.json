IMO, I don't think this is a problem on the same level. Presto does provide more richer SQL queries, but it does not store data itself, so there will be a process to ingest data from Druid, which will inevitably have some performance loss. And if Presto pushes most of the calculations down to Druid, then Druid still needs to have more SQL query capabilities, which is what the proposal is doing. I think this may be one of the reasons why Spark does not directly borrow the SQL features of Impala or Presto, but implement Spark SQL on its own.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/546298943/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/546303340","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/8735#issuecomment-546303340","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8735","id":546303340,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NjMwMzM0MA==","user":{"login":"doctording","id":11834821,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODM0ODIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11834821?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/doctording","html_url":"https://github.com/doctording","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doctording/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doctording/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doctording/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doctording/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doctording/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doctording/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doctording/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doctording/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doctording/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-25T10:43:29Z","updated_at":"2019-10-25T11:02:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"post data like this is not ok, also when function is not right\r\n```java\r\n{\r\n    \"selectStrategy\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"javascript\"\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nbut like this is ok\r\n\r\n```java\r\n{\r\n    \"selectStrategy\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"javascript\",\r\n        \"function\": \"function (config, zkWorkers, task) {\\nvar batch_workers = new java.util.ArrayList();\\nbatch_workers.add(\\\"localhost:8091\\\");\\nworkers = zkWorkers.keySet().toArray();\\nvar sortedWorkers = new Array()\\n;for(var i = 0; i < workers.length; i++){\\n sortedWorkers[i] = workers[i];\\n}\\nArray.prototype.sort.call(sortedWorkers,function(a, b){return zkWorkers.get(b).getCurrCapacityUsed() - zkWorkers.get(a).getCurrCapacityUsed();});\\nvar minWorkerVer = config.getMinWorkerVersion();\\nfor (var i = 0; i < sortedWorkers.length; i++) {\\n var worker = sortedWorkers[i];\\n  var zkWorker = zkWorkers.get(worker);\\n  if(zkWorker.canRunTask(task) && zkWorker.isValidVersion(minWorkerVer)){\\n    if(task.getType() == 'index_hadoop' && batch_workers.contains(worker)){\\n      return worker;\\n    } else {\\n      if(task.getType() != 'index_hadoop' && !batch_workers.contains(worker)){\\n        return worker;\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\nreturn null;\\n}\"\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/546303340/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/546349829","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/6943#issuecomment-546349829","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6943","id":546349829,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NjM0OTgyOQ==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-25T13:17:19Z","updated_at":"2019-10-25T13:17:19Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This pull request has been marked as stale due to 60 days of inactivity.

can not tell if you already do this from the diff but I think not: would it make sense to have a useful error message if someone does try to issue a select query explaining that it has been

org.apache.druid.query.Query]: known type ids = [Query, dataSourceMetadata, groupBy, scan, search, segmentMetadata, timeBoundary, timeseries, topN] at [Source:

a more specific error about a query type previously existing but is obsolete and has been removed, and bind it to `select` and anything else we ever remove. However, that also means I have to add some code and tests, and that makes me sad since I was just trying to nuke a bunch of code in this PR... but will add it if we really think it is necessary.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/546762230/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/546765504","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/8714#issuecomment-546765504","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8714","id":546765504,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0Njc2NTUwNA==","user":{"login":"natsumehu","id":27182488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MTgyNDg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27182488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/natsumehu","html_url":"https://github.com/natsumehu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natsumehu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natsumehu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natsumehu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natsumehu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natsumehu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natsumehu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natsumehu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natsumehu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natsumehu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-28T02:17:32Z","updated_at":"2019-10-28T02:17:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@gianm Can you help review this pr?

If they are actually not synonyms, the central doc place should highlight the difference.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/547931927/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/548058373","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/7394#issuecomment-548058373","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7394","id":548058373,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0ODA1ODM3Mw==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-30T18:43:54Z","updated_at":"2019-10-30T18:44:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The definitions I have been using recently¬†when writing docs and method names are:\r\n\r\n- _pending segment_ ‚Üí a segment that is currently being built by an indexer, but hasn't had its metadata inserted into the metadata store yet.\r\n- _pushed segment_ ‚Üí a segment that has been written to deep storage.

The Select query, even though flawed, was somewhat popular and I think this message will reduce confusion in the user base.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/548087635/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/548090750","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/8791#issuecomment-548090750","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8791","id":548090750,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0ODA5MDc1MA==","user":{"login":"vogievetsky","id":177816,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzgxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177816?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky","html_url":"https://github.com/vogievetsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-30T20:09:32Z","updated_at":"2019-10-30T20:09:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Can repro.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/548090750/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/548112999","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/8718#issuecomment-548112999","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8718","id":548112999,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0ODExMjk5OQ==","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-30T21:08:00Z","updated_at":"2019-10-30T21:08:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think tasks can be categorized into two groups, i.e., restorable tasks and non-restorable tasks.

Additionally, `inputSequenceType` specifies the behavior of the input sequences being fed into the `strategy`, covering behavior when the sequences are totally non-blocking, non-blocking after some amount of delay, and occasionally blocking after some delay. \r\n\r\nThe benchmarks are split into two because I wanted to look at two slightly different measurements of the worst case. The first is provided by `ParallelMergeCombiningSequenceBenchmark` which is measuring the time to complete a concurrently executed group of queries which uses an executor thread pool to run some number of concurrent sequences and collect the average time for the entire group of threads to complete. The second is to focus more on invididual thread experience and uses the JMH `@Thread` annotation, and is provided by `ParallelMergeCombiningSequenceJmhThreadsBenchmark`. This measurement is expected to be lower than the concurrency performance measurement provided by `ParallelMergeCombiningSequenceBenchmark` because it is not driven entirely by the _slowest_ thread, rather the slower threads will be averaged across all of the threads.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to run these yourself:\r\n```\r\njava -server -cp benchmarks/target/benchmarks.jar org.apache.druid.benchmark.sequences.ParallelMergeCombiningSequenceBenchmark\r\n```\r\nand\r\n```\r\njava -server -cp benchmarks/target/benchmarks.jar org.apache.druid.benchmark.sequences.ParallelMergeCombiningSequenceJmhThreadsBenchmark\r\n```\r\n\r\nJust be sure to adjust the configuration to **not include all of the available parameters** unless you have multiple days of patience for them to complete.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/548140327/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
