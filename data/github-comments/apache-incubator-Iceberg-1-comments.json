What do you think about this package?\r\n\r\nColumn encryption is interesting; on our side we haven't explored this yet, and thus would not really be able to handle per-column encryption, and need to, in the meantime, only encrypt at the top file layer. That is to say, our internal storage solution doesn't handle storing multiple keys to decrypt different portions of the same file. You'll also notice this as such in the hadoop-crypto library. So whatever solution we come up with should be able to handle a full file encryption _or_ a per-column encryption. I suppose though a file would only be able to be encrypted one way or the other way strictly; if we encrypt the whole file, you more or less lose all the benefits of per-column encryption.\r\n\r\nAdditionally a key part of performance is reducing the number of round trips made to the key storage backend, particularly if the backend supports batch operations. So it's ideal if the `KeyManager` could support getting and putting multiple keys at once, as well as implementing the Spark Data Source and other Iceberg clients to contact the backend as few times as possible.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/443356982/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/443357745","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/20#issuecomment-443357745","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/20","id":443357745,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MzM1Nzc0NQ==","user":{"login":"mccheah","id":8975385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NzUzODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8975385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mccheah","html_url":"https://github.com/mccheah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mccheah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mccheah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mccheah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mccheah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mccheah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mccheah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mccheah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mccheah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mccheah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-30T22:23:21Z","updated_at":"2018-11-30T22:23:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Tagging @vinooganesh @yifeih to follow.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/443357745/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/443363218","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/20#issuecomment-443363218","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/20","id":443363218,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MzM2MzIxOA==","user":{"login":"omalley","id":206536,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjUzNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/206536?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/omalley","html_url":"https://github.com/omalley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omalley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omalley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omalley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omalley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omalley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omalley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omalley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omalley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omalley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-30T22:48:34Z","updated_at":"2018-11-30T22:50:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I understand that column encryption take file format support and that isn't available yet, although it will be available for ORC soon.\r\n\r\nI haven't looked at the details of Palantir's hadoop-crypto library, but the approach looks good.

More precisely I _really_ don't want to tie us to KMS as the key storage backend for all Iceberg users. Here's a rough sketch of a design that I think could have that flexibility:\r\n\r\n- Define an `EncryptionMetadata` struct that is a column in the `DataFile` schema. It is optional. The struct has the following schema:\r\n\r\n```\r\nstruct EncryptionMetadata {\r\n    String keyName();\r\n    long keyVersion();\r\n    String encryptedKeyAlgorithm();\r\n    byte[] iv();\r\n    byte[] encryptedKeyBytes();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n- Define the structure `EncryptionKey` as follows; it's simply the real key (more or less just this [KeyMaterial](https://github.com/palantir/hadoop-crypto/blob/ac8d4474ee667121873bf0abf0674d83c78d8b90/crypto-keys/src/main/java/com/palantir/crypto2/keys/KeyMaterial.java#L25)\r\n\r\n```\r\nstruct EncryptionKey {\r\n    byte[] keyBytes();\r\n    byte[] iv();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Define a `KeyManager` that handles both read and generation of these keys.\r\n\r\n```\r\nstruct GeneratedEncryptionKey {\r\n    EncryptionMetadata keyMetadata();\r\n    EncryptionKey key();\r\n}\r\n\r\ninterface KeyManager {\r\n    EncryptionKey resolveEncryptionkey(EncryptionMetadata metadata);\r\n\r\n    // Optional, can just default to calling the individual resolve(...) multiple times.\r\n    List<EncryptionKey> resolveEncryptionKeyBatch(List<EncryptionMetadata> metadatas);\r\n\r\n    GeneratedEncryptionkey generateEncryptionKey(String filePath);\r\n\r\n    // Optional, can just default to calling the individual generate(...) multiple times.\r\n    List<GeneratedEncryptionKey> generateEncryptionKeyBatch(List<String> filePaths);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- We remark that `GeneratedEncryptionKey` as a pair of decrypted and encrypted key is required because we need both the decrypted key to actually encrypt the output stream wherever we're doing the encrypted-write itself, as well as the encrypted key to store in the manifest file after the fact.\r\n\r\nNow let's suppose we were to implement all of the above with KMS as the storage backend. I'd suppose we could provide this as the default implementation that ships with Iceberg.\r\n\r\n- `KeyManager#resolveEncryptionKey` goes to the KMS and asks to decrypt the key with the given metadata's name and the encrypted bytes. KMS uses the master key and passes back the decrypted key. `KeyManager` converts that into an `Encryptionkey` object and returns the value.\r\n- `KeyManager#generateEncryptionKey` generates a local key, tells KMS to encrypt it and gets back the encrypted key, Return the pair of decrypted and encrypted key in a `GeneratedEncryptionKey` struct.\r\n\r\nRegarding hadoop-crypto, I was considering it less for the [key storage](https://github.com/palantir/hadoop-crypto/blob/ac8d4474ee667121873bf0abf0674d83c78d8b90/crypto-keys/src/main/java/com/palantir/crypto2/keys/KeyStorageStrategy.java) layer and more so for its [in-memory representation of keys](https://github.com/palantir/hadoop-crypto/blob/ac8d4474ee667121873bf0abf0674d83c78d8b90/crypto-keys/src/main/java/com/palantir/crypto2/keys/KeyMaterial.java) and its [generation of ciphers from those  key objects](https://github.com/palantir/hadoop-crypto/blob/6d9e05a1e667f150f7d98435e93a0dd6f3ea5c08/crypto-core/src/main/java/com/palantir/crypto2/io/CryptoStreamFactory.java). Though the interface shouldn't expose hadoop-crypto objects, naturally.\r\n\r\nFinally to cap it all off I'd imagine `KeyManager` instances can be provided by implementations of `TableOperations` and must thus be serializable to be sent to e.g. Spark executors.\r\n\r\nThoughts on the above proposal?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/443371232/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/443382039","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/20#issuecomment-443382039","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/20","id":443382039,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MzM4MjAzOQ==","user":{"login":"mccheah","id":8975385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NzUzODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8975385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mccheah","html_url":"https://github.com/mccheah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mccheah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mccheah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mccheah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mccheah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mccheah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mccheah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mccheah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mccheah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mccheah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-01T00:42:18Z","updated_at":"2018-12-01T00:42:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm actually going to go ahead and put this into a prototype - we can add further discussion there.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/443382039/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/443383660","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/20#issuecomment-443383660","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/20","id":443383660,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MzM4MzY2MA==","user":{"login":"omalley","id":206536,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjUzNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/206536?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/omalley","html_url":"https://github.com/omalley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omalley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omalley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omalley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omalley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omalley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omalley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omalley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omalley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omalley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-01T00:55:29Z","updated_at":"2018-12-01T00:57:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ok, I'd separate out the key information from the encryption data:\r\n\r\n```\r\nstruct KeyDescription {\r\n  String keyName;\r\n  int keyVersion;\r\n}\r\n\r\nstruct FileKey {\r\n  KeyDescription key;\r\n  byte[] decryptedKey;\r\n  byte[] encryptedKey;\r\n}\r\n\r\nstruct FileEncryptionMetadata {\r\n  KeyDescription key;\r\n  byte[] encryptedKey;\r\n  byte[] iv;\r\n  String algorithm;\r\n}\r\n\r\ninterface KeyManager {\r\n   // Create a key for a single file.\r\n   FileKey createFileKey(String keyName);\r\n\r\n   // Decrypt a single file key\r\n   byte[] decryptKey(KeyDescription key, byte[] encryptedKey);\r\n\r\n   // Decrypt a list of keys\r\n   List<byte[]> decryptKeys(KeyDescription key, List<byte[]> encryptedKeys);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe KMS doesn't need the path, iv, or the algorithm.

In the long term it would be good to think about changing the import order to be consistent with the Google style guide.\r\n\r\n> * I like using static imports to cut down on code in symbol references, like EQ instead of Expressions.Operators.EQ.\r\n\r\nFair enough, let's add exclusions as we see fit. I already added some exclusion, I believe for literals and operators. We can add them for expressions as well. I don't think we want to allow static imports globally though, it leads to difficulty to trace a method call back to its source without an IDE (i.e. in CR).\r\n\r\n> * Non-static imports should be a single group in alphabetical order. Not sure why some moved.\r\n\r\nThat's what checkstyle should be supporting with this patch though? There were some that moved the core JDK imports into the main import block. I'll double check.\r\n\r\n> * I definitely prefer UUIDLiteral to UuidLiteral. That's also public API so we should avoid changing it.\r\n\r\nFair enough. Baseline wants to enforce camelCase for everything, so names with consecutive capital letters are not allowed. See [here](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s5.2.8-type-variable-names) and [here](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s5.3-camel-case). We can add an exclusion for `ID` and `UUID`, among others.\r\n\r\n> * Some variable name changes lose information, like the use of `classes` instead of `javaClasses`. That was intentional because the class is the one used for the Java in-memory representation.\r\n> * Is `fieldIdToFind` really better than `fieldId`? What rule is this matching? Same with `newStruct` instead of `struct`.\r\n\r\nBaseline's checkstyle requires all variables to not hide fields. This meant that for `fieldIdToFind`, the parameter `fieldId` was hiding the field `fieldId` of the same class. All these variable name changes were to deconflict. Can we define parameter and field names that don't conflict but that are sensible on a case by case basis? I made an initial attempt here, can revise these again.\r\n\r\n> * Seems like it would be easier to allow or require javadoc sentences to end in '.'\r\n\r\nIt's for the `@return` blocks. Opinion from baseline but we can revert it.\r\n\r\n> * Like allowing '.', using operators at the end of a line than a the start of the next would require fewer changes.\r\n\r\nI think we want to only enforce one or the other; we can find how to make the regex enforce the operators to be on the same line rather than on the next. Or we can just start making all operators move to the next line, as we do [here](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s4.5.1-line-wrapping-where-to-break).\r\n\r\n> Does this enforce a line length of 100 characters?\r\n\r\n120 characters by default.\r\n\r\n> Why does this require so many Palantir plugins? Are those required?\r\n\r\nThese are all Palantir's open-source tooling! Granted one can get all of them automatically applied by just applying the `com.palantir.baseline` plugin. The ideal end state is to apply `com.palantir.baseline` globally, but doing that requires not only fixing checkstyle everywhere but also applying error-prone and other linting plugins that require further patches. For example I noticed error-prone complaining about some of the ways we write `Preconditions` checks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/445041145/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/445066276","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/20#issuecomment-445066276","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/20","id":445066276,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NTA2NjI3Ng==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-06T23:20:00Z","updated_at":"2018-12-06T23:20:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"We should also loop in @ggershinsky, who is working on the Parquet encryption spec.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/445066276/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/445321961","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/38#issuecomment-445321961","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/38","id":445321961,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NTMyMTk2MQ==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-07T18:26:55Z","updated_at":"2018-12-07T18:26:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@govi20, I just saw your comment on the old issue.

I think the mentality is that a file path as the sole identifier of a file may not suffice for every use case.

Specifically, let's say that I have something of a \"source system\" notion that I would want to persist on a per file basis. Having this state as an attribute on the File object itself would support this type of use case. Does that make sense?

Let's say one of them is corrupt / doesn't work, and thus our RDD is in a bad state. Having this identifier would allow us to link the file to the source system the the file came from and allow us to talk to the data owners to remedy the issue.\r\n\r\n(2) Unique identifier on a per file basis - In this situation, we simply want a way to retrieve some static information on a per file basis outside of the path itself. For example, I think of this as something like the `Descriptor` in the SSTable object in Cassandra (https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/io/sstable/Descriptor.java#L62). The object does include the directory (https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/io/sstable/Descriptor.java#L56), but also includes something like the FormatType (https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/io/sstable/Descriptor.java#L62 - an enum for different SSTable formats). \r\n\r\nTaking a step back, it does sound a bit like metadata, but I do think having this type of information somewhere is important. Cassandra kind of hacks around it by encoding things like the SSTable version in the name itself (the path contains it), but we don't really have a similar way to retrieve this type of information without this identifier.
