We can do the check then in the handler for the `ReconnectResourceManager` message.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/295743483/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/295774075","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3476#issuecomment-295774075","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3476","id":295774075,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NTc3NDA3NQ==","user":{"login":"tzulitai","id":5284370,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODQzNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5284370?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai","html_url":"https://github.com/tzulitai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-20T15:15:06Z","updated_at":"2017-04-20T15:15:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing this PR in a favor of an updated version ..","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/295774075/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/295792909","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3746#issuecomment-295792909","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3746","id":295792909,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NTc5MjkwOQ==","user":{"login":"tzulitai","id":5284370,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODQzNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5284370?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai","html_url":"https://github.com/tzulitai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-20T16:03:54Z","updated_at":"2017-04-20T16:03:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@haohui FYI - tagging you as we discussed about this feature offline","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/295792909/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/295837502","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3736#issuecomment-295837502","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3736","id":295837502,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NTgzNzUwMg==","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-20T18:05:21Z","updated_at":"2017-04-20T18:05:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Could you change the PR title to \"[FLINK-6013][metrics] Add Datadog HTTP metrics reporter\"?

OutputFormats are not integrated with Flink's checkpointing mechanism. The `JdbcOutputFormat` buffers rows to write them out in batches. When records are buffered that arrived before the last checkpoint, they will be lost in case of a failure because they will not be replayed.\r\n\r\nThe JdbcTableSink should be integrated with Flink's checkpointing mechanism. In a nutshell, it should buffer records and commit them to the database when a checkpoint is taken. I think we need to think a bit more about a proper design for this feature. @zentol and @aljoscha might have some thoughts on this as well as they are more familiar with the implementation of checkpoint-aware sinks.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/296136379/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/296148743","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3623#issuecomment-296148743","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3623","id":296148743,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NjE0ODc0Mw==","user":{"login":"zhuoluoy","id":656810,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NjgxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/656810?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuoluoy","html_url":"https://github.com/zhuoluoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuoluoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuoluoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuoluoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuoluoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuoluoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuoluoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuoluoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuoluoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuoluoy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-21T09:56:55Z","updated_at":"2017-04-21T09:56:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @fhueske .

I agree with you about the risk of temporary DIST() ingestion. Perhaps we could meanwhile just work on the \"ProcessFunction +  Code generation\" keeping the DIST function for test purposes tests. My concern is that the code my change again and all the work would just be wasted. To be honest, the code generation is quite new to me, and I will have to learn to work on that. Meanwhile, I have almost completed a version that relies on current code generation, nesting the distinct logic. As it is almost done, I will share this one as well and then if necessary move to the code generation. what do you think?
