Sometimes it may be stuck due to imperfect FIFO behaviors, although it's getting improved from time to time. One alternative promising solution is constructing double buffering, but it costs more BRAM and it's not easy to construct from the IR.\r\n\r\nI don't have further requests. The following discussion is just my brainstorming and personal opinion for the issues raised by @tmoreau89. Free to ignore.\r\n\r\n===\r\n* For inserting pragmas, it indeed can be easily done for fine-grained optimizations such as loop unrolling and fine-grained pipeline (pipeline the innermost loop). On the other hand, for coarse-grained loops (the loop with at least one sub-loop that doesn't be fully unrolled), simply inserting pragma won't work. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfor (int i = 0; i < 32; ++i) {\r\n    for (int j = 0; j < 64; ++j) {\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo pipeline j-loop, we simply add pragma:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfor (int i = 0; i < 32; ++i) {\r\n    for (int j = 0; j < 64; ++j) {\r\n#pragma HLS pipeline\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, if we add pragma to i-loop, it actually becomes (the unroll pragma will be added by VivadoHLS automatically whatever you want):\r\n\r\n```\r\nfor (int i = 0; i < 32; ++i) {\r\n#pragma HLS pipeline\r\n    for (int j = 0; j < 64; ++j) {\r\n#pragma HLS unroll\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo this is still a fine-grained pipeline. In many cases, we don't want j-loop to be fully unrolled due to resource constraints. This is one of  the alternative solutions:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvoid func(...) {\r\n#pragma HLS inline off\r\n    for (int j = 0; j < 64; ++j) {\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfor (int i = 0; i < 32; ++i) {\r\n#pragma HLS pipeline\r\n    func(...);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy manually wrapping j-loop to a non-inline function (which will become a standalone module in the design), VivadoHLS won't automatically unroll j-loop and results in the coarse-grained pipeline we desired.\r\n\r\nThe same concept applies to loop parallelism as well.\r\n\r\n* For the use of block RAM (or SRAM), we usually declare a local array and explicitly use `memcpy` to enable memory burst from DRAM to BRAM. Maybe we can figure out a proper programming model for users to specify the data chunk size so that we can easily create the BRAM and enable memory burst.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/404913394/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/404915643","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/1420#issuecomment-404915643","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1420","id":404915643,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNDkxNTY0Mw==","user":{"login":"Laurawly","id":3700467,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDA0Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3700467?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly","html_url":"https://github.com/Laurawly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-13T18:28:09Z","updated_at":"2018-07-13T18:28:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rajh619 Glad to hear that you find the problem.

We’re currently in the process of refactoring\nthe watchdog implementation in the way you suggested (moving back to the\nactivity process). This requires getting the watchdog (moving to a service)\nto persist when the main activity dies, which may be tricky, but we have a\nWIP that looks fairly promising.

Each subgraph, therefore, contains a number of nodes. These subgraphs will be compiled into modules individually, potentially each one could be for a specific device. In the end, each module will be executed using tvm runtime. Any suggestions or comments will be appreciated.
