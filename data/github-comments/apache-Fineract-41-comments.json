In the current state of Fineract branch, I disagree. Right now, some authors I know keeps sending the PR after every hour till Travis passes the build and follows custom workflows to pass the build.\r\n\r\nExample of one such tedious flow : \r\n\r\n1. Wait for Travis or gradle test task to finish ( Check after 30-60 minutes - not receiving notifications)   \r\n2. If travis build failed, identify the test case that failed from travis log.\r\n3a. If the test case clearly appears to be broken by the current changes, fix it and resend PR. [Subjective Step]\r\n3b. If the test case isn't closely related to the PR, run Travis on the PR again to see if Travis results are idempotent.\r\n4. If the test case appears to be unrelated to the current change, make sure of this by examining and  running this test case locally.\r\n5a. Run this test case on  a fresh ‘develop’ branch to check if this fails,  this is a proof that this test case is broken and it is not due to current changes in the PR.\r\n5b. If the test case doesn't fail on develop, then code fix is required.\r\n\r\n\r\n---- Configuration Guidelines \r\nIf your PR includes a Global Configuration, update the teardown related code at  : -\r\nUpdate the verifyAllDefaultGlobalConfigurations() in GlobalConfigurationHelper.\r\n//There are currently 27 global configurations.\r\nAssert.assertEquals(27, expectedGlobalConfigurations.size());\r\nAssert.assertEquals(27, actualGlobalConfigurations.size());\r\nAlso add default configurations value to the list for teardown in getAllDefaultGlobalConfigurations()  in GlobalConfigurationHelper.java\r\n\r\n-----\r\nBetter chances of getting a green build  -\r\n- Run integration test locally on a fresh tenant (time-wise expensive) everytime \r\n- If a newly written integration test affects any other integration test, then there should be a teardown function written to restore to initial state so that other test cases execute on default state.\r\n\r\nThe build is failing again without any clear reason : -\r\nhttps://app.travis-ci.com/github/apache/fineract/builds/240299730\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/948901095/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/948938756","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/1918#issuecomment-948938756","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/1918","id":948938756,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAuLPJ844j6gE","user":{"login":"awasum","id":15528032,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTI4MDMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15528032?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/awasum","html_url":"https://github.com/awasum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awasum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awasum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awasum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awasum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awasum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awasum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awasum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awasum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awasum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-21T19:34:18Z","updated_at":"2021-10-21T19:34:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Travis is refusing to run. @IOhacker , @ptuomola any ideas?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/948938756/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/948940719","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/1918#issuecomment-948940719","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/1918","id":948940719,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAuLPJ844j6-v","user":{"login":"awasum","id":15528032,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTI4MDMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15528032?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/awasum","html_url":"https://github.com/awasum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awasum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awasum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awasum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awasum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awasum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awasum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awasum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awasum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awasum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-21T19:35:47Z","updated_at":"2021-10-21T19:35:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Please, dont merge this..

@avikganguly01 (cc @awasum @fynmanoj)\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I disagree with your description of the current state of the Fineract branch. Looking at the pull request history, I've merged around 350 PRs over the two years or so. For each of these, I've ensured all the tests pass before merging. So, in my view, this is not an unrealistic expectation. In fact, this is the only way we can make sure things improve rather than degrade. \r\n\r\nI agree there are still some flaky tests. But we've made a huge amount of progress on this over the last year: I've fixed at least 30 such tests myself. There are still a couple of known issues with:\r\n\r\na) performance of Travis (sometimes the build takes too long due to load on the Travis infra, and some tests time out)\r\n\r\nb) month end (some tests fail on last / first day of months, due to the fact that different months have different number of days and this confuses the checking routines for interest calculation)\r\n\r\nI agree we should fix these. But these handful of issues should not be an excuse for allowing code to be merged that breaks additional tests, without even investigating why the tests are failing. That will take us even further away from our goal of having reliable tests.
