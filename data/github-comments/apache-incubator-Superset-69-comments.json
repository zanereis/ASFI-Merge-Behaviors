I'd assume the former, which means you'd need to perform aggregations yourself and taking over a lot of the database's functions, resulting in much more workload on the web server that would have see all atomic data of the table on each query.\r\n\r\nIf it's the second use case, you could hook it in easily on top of existing datasource as some sort of hook for a dataframe mutator function that would receive the dataframe and return another.
