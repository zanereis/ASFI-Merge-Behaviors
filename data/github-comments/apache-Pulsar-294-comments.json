finally understand the nuance to this problem, and I am pretty sure I overstepped when I said that the two platforms were incompatible. There is a way to make this work for both platforms.\r\n\r\nI think some of my confusion came from the actual contents of this PR. The PR proposes the following:\r\n\r\n```Dockerfile\r\nRUN chown -R 0:0 /pulsar \\\r\n    && chmod -R g=u /pulsar\r\n```\r\n\r\nhowever, as @fransguelinckx shows, what is actually required is \r\n\r\n```Dockerfile\r\nRUN chgrp -R 0 /pulsar && \\\r\n    chmod -R g=u /pulsar\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe key nuance here is that members of the root group need to have write permissions. The user does not have to be root, as the PR proposes. Instead, we can have the user that owns all of the files be the `pulsar` user and then make sure that the files are owned by the root group with the proper write permissions.\r\n\r\nThat change will work properly for the OpenShift case because the root group will have sufficient permissions and it will work for the case where we're running as a non-root user and non-root group as long as the user is the `pulsar` user (the group won't actually matter, but at least it will be non-root, which will satisfy the pod security policy).\r\n\r\nAs an aside, using the `VOLUME` instruction would make sense if everyone were specifying a volume to mount for `/pulsar/data` and `/pulsar/conf`. As it is, I don't believe that is the case, which makes it less meaningful. Also, if the volumes were mounted, they would inherit the host's filesystem permissions, which would have been one way to override the default behavior of the container.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/773054002/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/773058004","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/9469#issuecomment-773058004","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/9469","id":773058004,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MzA1ODAwNA==","user":{"login":"Renkai","id":3381789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzODE3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3381789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renkai","html_url":"https://github.com/Renkai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renkai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renkai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renkai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renkai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renkai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renkai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renkai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renkai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renkai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-04T06:11:00Z","updated_at":"2021-02-04T06:11:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"/pulsarbot

This approach creates a very bad example for other people to follow.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, it basically creates a \"connector\" class per schema type. This is a very bad practice. I would discourage a connector implementation going down this route. It is impossible to maintain. \r\n\r\nSecondly, it solves a very narrow scoped problem by introducing a specific type of source connector in which the key is a string and the value is AVRO. All the key schema information is dropped. Key schema information is important to a lot of streaming use cases. You can't solve the problem with this approach. Following your approach, you will end up creating N*N connector classes (where N is the number of schema types). \r\n\r\nI would encourage people not introducing a code change that is specialized for their own needs. The connector implementation should be beneficial to broader users.\r\n\r\n> I would like not to enter the details of how Kafka and Confluent serialize data \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the Kafka AVRO is a confluent open-source thing not a Kafka community thing. \r\n\r\nWe are always in the game of touching serialization details when converting a message from X format to Y format. You either do the conversation at a high level using abstraction or at a low level by realizing the serialization details. \r\n\r\nThe approach you proposed also has a bad performance because it will churn a lot of object allocations. Realizing the serialization details can save a lot of memory copy and serialization/deserialization.\r\n\r\n> we allowing Sources to push GenericRecords,\r\n\r\nThis is a good initiative. But it should be isolated from this KafkaSource change.

let's find together the right way to provide features to the users in the best way for the project.\r\n\r\nyes. I already pointed out the right direction that we should head down.\r\n\r\n> We already have KafkaBytesSource and KafkaStringSource, so I am just adding a new flavour of the KafkaSource, in fact the implementation is just about adding a new subclass of KafkaAbstractSource.\r\nI am following the current style.\r\n\r\nIt was there doesn't mean it is the right pattern to follow. Kafka connector was not the first connect added it. Most of the MQ connectors don't have the schema information. Hence it is okay to maintain `bytes` or `string` connectors. But if we are talking about schema-aware connectors, let's avoid using this pattern. It is impossible to maintain the list of connectors. I would avoid going down this route.\r\n\r\n> we can work on this issue as well (and that's on my backlog), I didn't want to introduce too many features.\r\n\r\nIt is not about introducing too many features or not. This approach is hard to maintain. \r\n\r\n> Using the Java Model with GenericRecord adds that additional cost, but the benefit are:\r\n\r\nThe cost is huge when you have a very large struct. The connector should be designed to efficiently transfer data, instead of burning unnecessary CPUs.
