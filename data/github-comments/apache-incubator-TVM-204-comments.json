@slyubomirsky . Some highlevel comments.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, AOT should not be part of the runtime. Runtime contains the minimum set of things we need to execute the program. Most of the AOT logic are actually part of target translation phase. Taking the current organization of relay into account, they should be moved to `relay/backend`(eventually a better place might be `target`).\r\n\r\nOf course there are additional runtime features and wrappers needed to run the program compiled from AOT. From the interface point of view, we should remove these wrapper code and completely rely on the PackedFunc and runtime.Module interface.\r\n\r\nSo the AOT compilation should take in an IRModule and output a runtime.Module, which contains the functions necessary to run the generated program. Ideally the runtime.Module should contain similar interface with other compiled programs, such as the vm and the graph

Unfortunately, any instabilities that cause resets or crashes to the lock screen are enough to make long unmonitored autotuning runs untenable. \r\n\r\nFor this reason I’ve moved to cross compiling the C++ RPC app (#6229) and running it from the android shell which is much more stable.

How do you think the difference between MicroTVM and MCUNet?\r\n\r\nHi @wang-y-z.  I wasn't aware of this work until now.  Thanks for the pointer!  It's a bit embarrassing to see them compare against the old runtime that was designed purely for AutoTVM purposes (and it only _happened_ to be able to run entire models).  Because of that design goal, it makes no use of flash memory, so it runs out of memory very quickly 😅.\r\n\r\nI'd say TinyNAS isn't comparable to µTVM, since µTVM doesn't currently do any architecture search.  You could imagine using only TinyNAS to produce a model, then importing the result and running it with µTVM.\r\n\r\nTinyEngine is an interesting point of comparison, since it uses a codegen-based approach, and this is the approach we want to move towards going forward.  For the past few months, we've focused on strengthening support for autotuning and deployment with the C graph runtime.  However, as we look at smaller devices, there are a lot of mechanisms in the graph runtime that cause unnecessarily high memory usage (e.g., runtime overhead and JSON parsing).  With the prototype Relay AoT compiler being merged soon (#6219), we'll have a good starting point for an entirely codegen-based approach.\r\n\r\nThough the codegen approach seems to give them the most benefit (Figure 4), the model-adaptive/memory-aware optimizations in TinyEngine look compelling as well, and it would certainly be interesting to see how they could be implemented in TVM.\r\n\r\n> By the way, can you tell me what's going on about MicroTVM on RICS-V device and if you have plan to support the User defined extensions for RV?\r\n\r\nWe haven't prioritized RISC-V-specific features, since we're still building up all of the device-agnostic infrastructure.  Is there a use case for user-defined extensions you have in mind?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/670653285/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/670660890","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6121#issuecomment-670660890","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6121","id":670660890,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3MDY2MDg5MA==","user":{"login":"anijain2305","id":13822661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODIyNjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13822661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305","html_url":"https://github.com/anijain2305","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-07T18:54:27Z","updated_at":"2020-08-07T18:54:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Shawn-Inspur @Laurawly Can you please review when you get time?

Many codes and tests related to the variance operator need to be changed. For example, we should also add `variance_shape_func` in `python/tvm/relay/op/_reduce.py`. `std` and `variance` should be isolated from `python/tvm/relay/op/reduce.py` because their parameters are different from other reduce ops.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, although adding two unbiased operators seems a bit redundant, it has little impact on the code structure and is of a lower probability of causing bugs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/670922682/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/670975972","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6232#issuecomment-670975972","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6232","id":670975972,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3MDk3NTk3Mg==","user":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-08T21:31:32Z","updated_at":"2020-08-08T21:33:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I mean, the new `VarianceAttrs` should also have all attributes of `ReduceAttrs`.

Could you elaborate a bit why those two don't fit?\r\n\r\nThe Ethos-N compiler compiles the graph down to a so-called 'command stream' which is a binary artifact that is directly consumed by the driver to execute the inference. It has encoded within it all the constants/weights. We're not calling out to a C library so the C source module wouldn't make sense here. Additionally, the JSON runtime wouldn't really add any useful functionality. We just want to load the artifact off the disk and wrap it in a packed function.\r\n\r\n> It seems that we are not really able to test them on HW in the CI. Is there any plan on this?\r\n\r\nWe don't expect there to be HW in CI. CI will run SW testing including a mocked inference function so that we can test the compilation flow all the way through to the runtime. We will be running automated HW testing on a range of networks within Arm.\r\n\r\nTo be explicit about the next 2 PRs, they are already written and only add more operators. Specifically, the next PR will add quantized conv2d and the final one will add quite a few more less complex operators. We wanted to split these up to make it easier to see how the codegen operates without the added complexity of all the other operators. The final PR will also include network tests for mobilenet, inceptionv3/4 and ssd mobilenet.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/672137931/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/672179856","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6249#issuecomment-672179856","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6249","id":672179856,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3MjE3OTg1Ng==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-11T18:38:37Z","updated_at":"2020-08-11T18:38:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"cc @cloud-mxd due to the CI problem as in https://ci.tvm.ai/blue/organizations/jenkins/tvm/detail/PR-6162/29/pipeline/\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to send another PR and fix the related problem.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/672179856/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/672180416","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6249#issuecomment-672180416","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6249","id":672180416,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3MjE4MDQxNg==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-11T18:39:29Z","updated_at":"2020-08-11T18:39:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"cc @jroesch ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/672180416/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/672241664","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6242#issuecomment-672241664","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6242","id":672241664,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3MjI0MTY2NA==","user":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-11T19:49:55Z","updated_at":"2020-08-11T19:49:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I suppose this series of change are really big.
