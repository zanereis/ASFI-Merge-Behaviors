In other words, I'm unsure if the thread safety issue is a hive issue or a druid issue (and also I haven't yet even found how to open an issue on hive yet😛)\r\n\r\nAlso as I mentioned, the other issue is that the latest version of `BloomKFilter` in hive is incompatible with the current version we are using, which my hive compat test on 'floats' caught because I initially copied `BloomKFilter` from master. I don't know if this is intended or not, the jira associated with the change makes no mention of breaking compatibility so maybe it was accidental.\r\n\r\nI agree that if for whatever reason I need to break hive compatibility it will be more appropriate to put in another extension, or yeah, rework this one to support multiple

just became aware of the underlying [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01969) for this submission a few days ago and are still in the process of reviewing it.  \r\n\r\nIt is not up to me whether this code should be merged into Druid as a custom aggregator. However, the code has almost no Javadocs and the paper may be difficult for many users to fully understanding the trade-offs, advantages and disadvantages for how and when to use this kind of quantiles sketch as compared to the DataSketches (DS) quantiles sketches [already available](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/tree/master/extensions-core/datasketches/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/query/aggregation/datasketches) in Druid.  \r\n\r\nQuoting from the paper's Abstract:\r\n\r\n> Empirical evaluation shows that the moments sketch can achieve less than 1 percent quantile error with 15× less overhead than comparable summaries, improving end query time in the MacroBase engine by up to 7× and the Druid engine by up to 60×.\r\n\r\nThis is a very exciting claim, but understanding some of the assumptions behind this claim requires a bit of a deep-dive into the paper and unraveling what this sketch would be great at doing, and where it may not be so great.\r\n\r\nThe Moments-Quantiles (M-Sketch) has been optimized for merge-time performance and for this metric the M-Sketch really shines.  It's merge speed can be an order-of-magnitude faster than the DS-sketch.  Meanwhile, obtaining a M-Sketch quantile estimate can be milliseconds, while the DS-Sketch is in the microsecond range. \r\n\r\nThe paper defines the primary metric for sketch performance as _total query-time_, where the number of merges are large and the number of get-quantile estimate is rare, and perhaps for many Druid queries, this trade-off makes sense.\r\n \r\nThe other major tradeoff is how sketch accuracy is defined and measured. \r\n\r\n1. The paper is very clear: \"The M-Sketch accuracy is dataset dependent\". By comparison, the accuracy of the DS-Sketch is __data independent__. \r\n\r\nThis difference has several practical real-world implications. \r\n\r\nThe DS-Sketch doesn't care how ugly your input data stream is.  It can have negative values, zeros, gaps and multiple spikes or blocks in its distribution of values, the values can range over many orders-of-magnitude, and the error guarantees of the DS-Sketch will still hold. \r\n\r\nHowever, the authors of the paper make it clear in several places that M-Sketch error gurantees only apply to relatively well-behaved and smooth value distributions (what the paper calls \"non-pathological\").  Unfortunately the term \"non-pathological\" is not well-defined and the user has no way of knowing whether or not any given input data stream is appropriately \"non-pathological\" without performing extensive brute-force quantile analysis of the stream and comparing it with the M-Sketch results. \r\n\r\nAnother subtle difference between the two types of sketches is how error performance is measured and quoted. \r\n\r\n(This part is greatly simplified.) \r\n\r\nThe M-sketch paper effectively defines a total area difference between two distribution curves; one being the real underlying distribution, and the other being the curve effectively modeled by the moments computed by the sketch. Then the paper defines the maximum error as effectively the maximum average error (the integral) of all queries along all points of the distribution. The DS-Sketch defines the maximum error as the maximum difference between the two curves at any point along the full range of the distribution. \r\n\r\nThis means that the actual error from the M-Sketch could be huge (many times the quoted maximum error) for parts of the distribution, and very small for other parts of the curve so that, on average, if you perform queries over the full range of values of the distribution, the average error would be pretty good. But the user would have no clue _where_ along the distribution the error is very low, or outrageously high.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, the DS-Sketch error guarantee is for any single query and for all queries. \r\n\r\nThe other consequence of M-Sketch's error dependance on the data is that the M-sketch cannot give the user any before-the-fact guidance on what the error will be after the data has been sketched. The DS-Sketch does provide this guidance.\r\n\r\nSo as long as you know a great deal about the underlying distributions of your data, or you don't care too much about error, and you are only concerned about total-query-time, go ahead and use the M-Sketch. \r\n\r\nIf you don't know anything about the underlying distributions of your data and you do care about error, and slower total-query-time is an affordable trade-off, then I would advise you use the DataSketches/quantiles sketch.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nLee.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/436856077/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":8,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/436882993","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/6584#issuecomment-436882993","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6584","id":436882993,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNjg4Mjk5Mw==","user":{"login":"nishantmonu51","id":5023786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjM3ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5023786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51","html_url":"https://github.com/nishantmonu51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-08T06:01:23Z","updated_at":"2018-11-08T06:01:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@clintropolis: Can you also submit a bug and patch against hive for fixing the same in hive-storage-api.

Author of the paper here, I wanted to confirm that I fully agree with your analysis of when the M-sketch would or would not be appropriate. The actual error is data dependent. In many situations I would prefer to use the datasketches library as well which I found to be fairly reliable in my experiments. One other point to keep in mind is that the space usage of the M-sketch is also extremely low (usually < 150 bytes) so I often think of it as serving as a supplement to basic statistics and tiny histograms rather than a full-fledged sketch.

But after 0.13.0 I think we need a better way of handling this. I don't think it's user-friendly to ask users, especially new users, to write private extensions or even long configuration files in order to get metrics emission to work. There are two questions packed in here.\r\n\r\nFirst, what metrics do we emit by default? It could be some \"reasonable\" level, it could be everything, or it could be nothing. @jon-wei and I have advocated for \"reasonable\". @leventov has said he would prefer \"nothing\", but in a concession to backwards compatibility, is ok with \"the level that was in place when the QueryMetrics system was set up\".\r\n\r\nSecond, how do cluster operators customize metrics emitting? Today, they have to write a private extension. It sounds like everyone things configuration would be a good option, but it's not implemented yet.\r\n\r\nI would like to propose the following.\r\n\r\n- Adopt the \"reasonable\" standard for new metrics (if a new user comes in, with zero configuration, they get this \"reasonable\" set). The names of these metrics and metric-dimensions are part of Druid's public API. Other metrics and metric-dimensions, that are not in the default set, are _not_ in Druid's public API.\r\n- Continue to support QueryMetrics extensions as a way for advanced operators to have full control over how metrics emission works. It will work the same way as it works now. If a new kind of metric or metric-dimension is added, then QueryMetrics extension authors will still be 'notified' and have the opportunity to decide what to do about it.\r\n- Consider building a configuration-based approach that lets intermediate users do some customizations through config only.\r\n\r\nI feel that this approach will provide stability for a core set of most-useful metrics, while still allowing customizability, and allowing some mechanism to add \"advanced\" metrics that aren't part of the public API, if we want to do that for some reason.\r\n\r\nBtw, with regard to the suggestion below for how configuration works, I don't see how it adds value beyond making the name \"query/node/backpressure\" part of the public API of Druid. It eliminates that, but introduces a new thing \"nodeBackPressureTime\" that _is_ part of the public API (we can't change it without breaking old configs).\r\n\r\n```\r\ndruid.query.queryMetrics.default.metrics.nodeBackPressureTime.name=query/node/backpressure\r\ndruid.query.queryMetrics.default.metrics.nodeBackPressureTime.unit=nanoseconds\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/438438378/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/438447015","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/6605#issuecomment-438447015","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6605","id":438447015,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzODQ0NzAxNQ==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-13T21:36:53Z","updated_at":"2018-11-13T21:36:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the contribution @deiwin!

Then, if one day we migrate to a different network comm mechanism and `nodeBackPressureTime` becomes irrelevant, we could remove this thing and add another metric `druid.query.queryMetrics.default.metrics.somethingCompletelyDifferent` for network comm health telemetry. Then user's configs become invalid, and Druid will fail to start with an exception with old config. It will *force* users to recognize that the metric has been removed.\r\n\r\nWhat is possible with \"reasonable\" metrics emitted by default being public API:\r\n 1) Users depend on those metrics and set up alerts for them exceeding some thresholds.\r\n 2) At some point we remove those metrics, or change their units, or resolution, or due to some architectural changes in Druid \"normal\" and \"ill\" values for the metric become completely different.\r\n 3) Users don't notice that, their alerting dashboards keep silence because they are happy with the metrics being apparently zero or very low.\r\n\r\nAlso, again, the reasonable per-query metric could significantly increase the total metric volume, so that the metric collecting system becomes overloaded, or if this is a commercial SaaS service, the cost is suddenly up.\r\n\r\nSo ultimately I don't believe this is a safe default path. We should assume that users don't read the documentation at all, or skip some parts of it arbitrarily.\r\n\r\nI agree there could be a *non-default* metrics option \"reasonable\", the doc of which (assuming that if users set some option in their config, they read at least the doc of that particular option) says that:\r\n - The emitted metrics are *not* public Druid API, they could be renamed, revoked, unit changed, etc. at any release;\r\n - Setting up alerts based on those metrics, be prepared to re-check each metric on each Druid update;\r\n - The amount of emitted \"reasonable\" metrics could significantly increase on a Druid update; the metric collecting system could get choked or become more expensive.\r\n\r\nIf a user reads this and agrees with this, then fine.\r\n\r\n> Consider building a configuration-based approach that lets intermediate users do some customizations through config only.\r\n\r\nI think it's not something just to consider, it should be in place and should be the default.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/438460201/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/438460738","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/6503#issuecomment-438460738","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6503","id":438460738,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzODQ2MDczOA==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-13T22:21:23Z","updated_at":"2018-11-13T22:21:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'll try to take a look and have an opinion on it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/438460738/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/438523967","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/6587#issuecomment-438523967","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6587","id":438523967,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzODUyMzk2Nw==","user":{"login":"QiuMM","id":15156517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTU2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15156517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/QiuMM","html_url":"https://github.com/QiuMM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QiuMM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QiuMM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QiuMM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QiuMM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QiuMM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QiuMM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QiuMM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QiuMM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QiuMM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-14T03:22:09Z","updated_at":"2018-11-14T13:35:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@gianm for metrics, I think it's enough to emit max lag, average lag and total lag across all partitions.

Then, if one day we migrate to a different network comm mechanism and nodeBackPressureTime becomes irrelevant, we could remove this thing and add another metric druid.query.queryMetrics.default.metrics.somethingCompletelyDifferent for network comm health telemetry. Then user's configs become invalid, and Druid will fail to start with an exception with old config. It will force users to recognize that the metric has been removed.\r\n> …\r\n> I agree there could be a non-default metrics option \"reasonable\", the doc of which (assuming that if users set some option in their config, they read at least the doc of that particular option) says that:\r\n>\r\n> - The emitted metrics are not public Druid API, they could be renamed, revoked, unit changed, etc. at any release;\r\n> - Setting up alerts based on those metrics, be prepared to re-check each metric on each Druid update;\r\n> - The amount of emitted \"reasonable\" metrics could significantly increase on a Druid update; the metric collecting system could get choked or become more expensive.\r\n\r\nI just don't think this method is a user-friendly way of handling metrics. It means that users won't get metrics unless they manually specify a line of configuration for each one. New users don't generally know what metrics are useful until they run into some problem that metrics help debug. At that point, it would be best if the metric were already available in their metrics collection system, rather than requiring the user to go back and turn it on with a cluster redeploy. Requiring users to think about each metric ahead of time is a setup burden.\r\n\r\nI also think it would be better to abandon the desire to be able to change any query metrics on any release. We should think carefully about new metrics we add to the \"public API\" set, and then once we add them, don't change their names or units. We should feel free retire them if they become obsolete (like in your example of using a totally different network communication mechanism), but we should avoid changing their names or meanings. I don't think a mechanism to automatically notify users of such changes and force them to deal with them is the right solution, since that still makes upgrading a tougher process, which we should be trying to avoid.\r\n\r\nI think it's also best if the \"public API\" set of metrics is relatively large, as a percentage of overall metrics. It makes the system even more user friendly and easier to upgrade.\r\n\r\n> Also, again, the reasonable per-query metric could significantly increase the total metric volume, so that the metric collecting system becomes overloaded, or if this is a commercial SaaS service, the cost is suddenly up.\r\n\r\nI definitely have a lot more sympathy for this concern than for the concern about wanting to make backwards-incompatible changes. I think that we can address this metrics size concern by having it be part of the thought process for adding new metrics. I don't think the thought process needs to be as severe as \"no new metric-dimensions by default, ever\" but I can see it making sense to avoid adding any new _metrics_ to the default set. Since new metrics mean big increases in volumes, but new metric-dimensions are relatively small increases, and can be worth it.\r\n\r\nMy experience has been that the per-segment metrics are the vast majority of bulk of query metrics, by volume. I am down for a policy that we shouldn't add more of those by default. I would also be fine with _removing_ them from the default set, if we had an easy configuration-based way to turn them back on. I have definitely seen those per-segment metrics overwhelm peoples' metric collection systems, so yeah, agreed that is a real issue.\r\n\r\nConcretely, I could see it making sense to do the following.\r\n\r\n- Not include the backpressure metric in the default set.\r\n- Maybe even remove per-segment metrics from the default set?\r\n- Create a configuration based approach that lets people set their query metrics to \"none\" or \"default\" or \"all\". Maybe even more customization than that, I dunno.\r\n- Allow the \"default\" set to evolve over time to add new dimensions if they are broadly useful, but avoid adding new metrics to the default set. The goal is to avoid increasing the size of metrics by too much. I think \"identity\" is a good example of a metric that makes sense to add to the default set. It is broadly useful to anyone that enabled authentication, and to people that didn't, it always has the same value so will compress well.\r\n- Consider metric names and units part of Druid's public API and avoid changing them (but feel free to remove obsolete ones).\r\n- Keep doing the QueryMetrics thing to allow full customization and force-notification for people that want that.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/439222950/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/439290848","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/6623#issuecomment-439290848","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6623","id":439290848,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzOTI5MDg0OA==","user":{"login":"hate13","id":16034463,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDM0NDYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16034463?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hate13","html_url":"https://github.com/hate13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hate13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hate13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hate13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hate13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hate13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hate13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hate13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hate13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hate13/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-16T05:58:44Z","updated_at":"2018-11-16T05:58:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@QiuMM @asdf2014 We made some simple test as follows.\r\n\r\npartitions: 1000,\r\nkafka.network.RequestMetrics.TotalTimeMs.Offsets.99thPercentile: 500ms\r\n\r\nUsing KafkaConsumer#endOffsets takes about 300~3000ms, while the previous way takes almost 100s.
