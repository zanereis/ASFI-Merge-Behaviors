first, I didn't start work on this JIRA myself because I haven't had the time to come to a complete understanding of the current and intended functionality, nor of the scope of the problem from running completeRecovery() on an Akka scheduler thread, so you shouldn't assume that the JIRA fully describes the problem or that solving just what it describes constitutes a complete fix.  For example, any exception currently thrown by completeRecovery() when run by the scheduler will not be caught because of SPARK-1620, so a complete fix to the use of the scheduler from `case ElectedLeader` will also have to incorporate whatever we end up doing to fix that issue.\n\nSecond, what you've done in this PR significantly changes the results of calling completeRecovery(), and there is at least a minor problem in doing so.  Previously, schedule() would be called synchronously after setting RecoveryState.ALIVE and before logging the completion of recovery.  Now you're causing recovery() to be called asynchronously when the TriggerSchedule event makes its way to the head of the message queue.  That will potentially be long after RecoveryState.ALIVE has been set, the completion of recovery has been logged, and other events are processed with the new RecoveryState even though schedule() has not yet been run.  The out-of-order logging is at least a minor problem.  The processing of other events before schedule() has been run is potentially a major problem -- but like I said, I haven't yet worked through exactly how things are supposed to work, so I'm also not certain how big of a problem this PR would create.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/42154867/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/42155233","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/639#issuecomment-42155233","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/639","id":42155233,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMTU1MjMz","user":{"login":"AmplabJenkins","id":4031291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzEyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4031291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/AmplabJenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-05T02:33:24Z","updated_at":"2014-05-05T02:33:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Merged build finished.

was thinking about this JIRA earlier, but the solution I had in mind was to change the schedule to send a \"CompleteRecovery\" message instead of having the completeRecovery() method send a TriggerSchedule method. Incidentally, the CompleteRecovery message already exists, because I totally meant to use it...\n\nI'm not sure I fully understand how schedule behaves in the face of restart, though. Really, we don't want CompleteRecovery coming from a prior version of the actor (i.e., between restarts).

this?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/42156144/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/42156235","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/636#issuecomment-42156235","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/636","id":42156235,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMTU2MjM1","user":{"login":"AmplabJenkins","id":4031291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzEyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4031291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/AmplabJenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-05T03:13:53Z","updated_at":"2014-05-05T03:13:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Merged

, thank you very much for the comments and I'm sorry that I didn't explain clearly in the description of the PR, let me try to explain why I come up with this solution, \n\nfirst, I went through the instances you mentioned in SPARK-1620 before I submit this patch, also I read the API document of Akka...I didn't find a general way (maybe I missed something) to capture exception in the caller thread...so I think we need to have a case-specific solution for each instance there, or we should say that we need to be careful when use Akka.scheduler.schedule() to do some timer task...but I'm not sure if I'm correct on this point, so I didn't address exception handle issue in this PR\n\nsecond, I'm aware of the change of the behaviour in my solution (the scheduling is called asynchronously). Actually in my opinion, it is even safe to remove the call (I guess, this line is here is just for more frequent scheduling?), because schedule() is also called in  other places (relaunchDriver()). (But now, I realized that that call of schedule() in relaunchDriver() is also a potential problem, as it's called in completeRecovery, maybe we should change that call to TriggerSchedule also) Or, we should refactor schedule() method to be just send TriggerSchedule to the actor, and update the TriggerSchedule handle to do real schedule work, in this way we can prevent the future risk of calling schedule() in another thread\n\n@aarondav , I think sending a completeRecovery message is simpler than what I proposed above... I guess we can capture the return value of akka.scheduler.schedule() and cancel that in postStop as you proposed....\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/42181908/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/42182222","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/639#issuecomment-42182222","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/639","id":42182222,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMTgyMjIy","user":{"login":"CodingCat","id":678008,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3ODAwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/678008?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat","html_url":"https://github.com/CodingCat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-05T12:25:02Z","updated_at":"2014-05-05T12:25:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"for

From what I can tell, a default uncaught exception handler set in the thread that calls scheduler.schedule won't catch exceptions from a scheduled function, but it will catch at least some exceptions thrown by Akka itself (e.g. if the scheduled function closes over a reference that becomes unreachable in the scheduled function.)  Similarly, an uncaught exception handler set within the ActorSystem (as we do in IndestructibleActorSystem) won't catch exceptions thrown by scheduled functions.\n\nWhat will work is an explicit try-catch in the scheduled code (which can allow the scheduled event to happen again) or setting an uncaught exception handler explicitly on the scheduled thread (which will not allow any further scheduled events after the first thrown exception.)  The latter approach is about as generalizable as we can get, I think, and is the approach I took in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/622.  That PR could be extended to cover the scheduling of completeRecovery() as well, but maybe the fix for the rest of SPARK-1686 will make that unnecessary.  \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/42195672/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/42200700","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/647#issuecomment-42200700","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/647","id":42200700,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMjAwNzAw","user":{"login":"AmplabJenkins","id":4031291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzEyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4031291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/AmplabJenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-05T15:32:58Z","updated_at":"2014-05-05T15:32:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Can one of the admins verify this patch?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/42200700/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
