@mgao0 please find answers inline!\r\n> Thanks for the PR. I have several general question:\r\n> \r\n> 1. Is there a reason why we need a long-running thread for AsyncMissingTopStateMonitor?  Can we couple the update of ResourceMonitor with the update of updateMissingTopStateResourceMap in ClusterStatusMonitor, instead of checking the map periodically?\r\n--> The reason of decoupling metric reporting with existing main process of clusterstatusmonitor is to report metric irrespective of any event is being handled or not. Hence we couple of this with clusterstatusmonitor then thread will report metric only when resourcemap is updated ie., any event happens. About long-running thread, it sleeps whenever all resources have all partitions with top state recovered. To save some resources i had added a sleep in thread.\r\n> 2. Can we make this metric as optional, one that can be turned on and turned off by config?\r\n--> That's a good point! To be honest i'm not sure. In my mind this is very small features hence guarding it behind flag may not be that useful. In terms resource usage or performance it should not that much since it's single thread which should be running only when any resources have any partitions with missing top state. I'm open for suggestions though :)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/1401049891/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/1401113057","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/helix/pull/2344#issuecomment-1401113057","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2344","id":1401113057,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAPIHxc5Tg0nh","user":{"login":"xyuanlu","id":6392021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTIwMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6392021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu","html_url":"https://github.com/xyuanlu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-23T22:49:13Z","updated_at":"2023-01-23T22:49:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"A general question here.

To add more details, the conclusion is that if only for count of missing top state partition, we don't need an async thread, we can just couple it with ClusterStatusMonitor, but if we want to get a real time measurement for how long the missing top state has been lasting, then it makes sense to use an async thread. Thanks for making the change from counting the count to measuring the duration, and from gauge to histogram which shows the distribution of missing top state duration for different partitions, I think it makes sense.

Retry should be added into each test case whenever we determine that a retry fits the test logic. Adding retry to everything blindly just hide problem. It would be much worse if the problem happens in production (where retry won't help).\r\n3.
