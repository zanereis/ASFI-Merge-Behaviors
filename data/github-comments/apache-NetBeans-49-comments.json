So it sees no children and assumes the table model doesn't need updating.  Then the next DynamicNodeListener executes and adds some children, but ends up using the wrong layout as the underlying model didn't update.\r\n\r\nAn alternative fix is to ensure that the EventBroadcaster listener is always the last listener to run.  Any previous listeners which update the tree state will have already executed by that point.  This can be achieved by modifying TreePathSupport as follows:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    /**\r\n     * Add a TreeWillExpandListener.\r\n     * @param l The tree will expand listener\r\n     */\r\n    public synchronized void addTreeWillExpandListener (TreeWillExpandListener l) {\r\n        weListeners.add(0, l); // insert new listeners at the start.

I looked through https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1415 as well.\r\n\r\nRecentish JDK versions (9 and above) handle HiDPI screens very well on both Windows and MacOS, including in multi-monitor setups. Each monitor gets assigned a DPI scaling factor (e.g. 1x, 2x, 1.5x), and GraphicsConfiguration.getDefaultTransform() will be scaled accordingly. No need to change font sizes at the Swing level. Dragging a window from a regular screen (1x) to a HiDPI screen (e.g. 2x) will cause fonts to be rendered with a higher device resolution, but does not change the logical size of the font. Are you sure this does not work on Linux as well?\r\n\r\nFor example, could you configure your Linux multi-monitor setup with one screen at 2x scaling and one at 1x scaling, and then run the following? What output do you get?\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport java.awt.GraphicsDevice;\r\nimport java.awt.GraphicsEnvironment;\r\n\r\npublic class ShowDPIScaling {\r\n  public static final void main(String args[]) {\r\n    for (GraphicsDevice gd : GraphicsEnvironment.getLocalGraphicsEnvironment().getScreenDevices())\r\n      System.out.println(gd.getDefaultConfiguration().getDefaultTransform().getScaleX());\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is not really related to what the monitor reports at a hardware level--it's just an OS-level setting (though on Windows and MacOS, the OS may take its _default_ from monitor hardware). Is there not an equivalent setting somewhere on Linux? If there is, then perhaps NetBeans should show a message explaining to the user how to configure this OS-level setting, for each individual monitor, rather than changing a single setting that applies to all monitors?\r\n\r\nAs you have probably discovered, Toolkit.getScreenResolution() should not be relied on. It has no meaningful semantics in a world of multi-monitor setups and HiDPI scalings. This is true on Windows and MacOS as well. On Windows, it behaves differently depending on whether the user has logged out and back in again since the last time the monitor setup was changed and so on. The correct way to detect HiDPI scaling factors is through GraphicsConfiguration.getDefaultTransform()--though this is normally handled transparently by Swing/Java2D.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/556372689/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/556443755","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1446#issuecomment-556443755","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/1446","id":556443755,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NjQ0Mzc1NQ==","user":{"login":"eirikbakke","id":886243,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NjI0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/886243?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke","html_url":"https://github.com/eirikbakke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-20T21:49:23Z","updated_at":"2019-11-20T21:49:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Here's the JDK patch that introduced HiDPI support on Linux, by the way:\r\n\r\nhttps://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8137571\r\n\r\nThe per-monitor DPI scaling factor is retrieved in the native method X11GraphicsDevice.getNativeScaleFactor(int):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/d7a0fb9ebc898e76207c27166b81630e837a064a/src/java.desktop/unix/classes/sun/awt/X11GraphicsDevice.java\r\nhttps://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/7a052c979c9ef8a01a4a52195a4ab786ebbce543/src/java.desktop/unix/native/libawt_xawt/awt/awt_GraphicsEnv.c\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/556443755/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/556523864","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1628#issuecomment-556523864","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/1628","id":556523864,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NjUyMzg2NA==","user":{"login":"BradWalker","id":930871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzMDg3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/930871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker","html_url":"https://github.com/BradWalker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-20T23:04:41Z","updated_at":"2019-11-20T23:04:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@lkishalmi  Thanks for looking at this..

I found two differences.\r\n\r\n#### Previous tests\r\n\r\nThe first difference is due to using the early-access build of JavaFX 14 instead of the released version 13.0.1. With JavaFX 13.0.1, showing the documentation in an external Web browser opens the Javadoc page at the following location:\r\n\r\n> http://127.0.0.1:8082/resource/jar%3Afile%3A/home/john/.m2/repository/org/openjfx/javafx-graphics/13.0.1/javafx-graphics-13.0.1-javadoc.jar%21/javafx.graphics/javafx/stage/Stage.html#show%28%29\r\n\r\nWith the early-access build of JavaFX 14-ea+2, showing the documentation in an external Web browser opens an error page at the following location:\r\n\r\n> http://127.0.0.1:8082/resource/jar%3Afile%3A/home/john/.m2/repository/org/openjfx/javafx-graphics/14-ea%2B2/javafx-graphics-14-ea%2B2-javadoc.jar%21/javafx.graphics/javafx/stage/Stage.html#show%28%29\r\n\r\nThe error page contains:\r\n\r\n> **Error: 500**\r\n>\r\n> Location: /resource/jar%3Afile%3A/home/john/.m2/repository/org/openjfx/javafx-graphics/14-ea%2B2/javafx-graphics-14-ea%2B2-javadoc.jar%21/javafx.graphics/javafx/stage/Stage.html\r\n>\r\n> No detailed message\r\n\r\nIt seems to be a simple URL-encoding problem, but I couldn't find a different encoding of the plus sign that worked. I would suggest there's a problem in the JavaFX version string, except that it's part of the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) customs:\r\n\r\n> Build metadata MAY be denoted by appending a plus sign and a series of dot separated identifiers immediately following the patch or pre-release version.\r\n\r\n#### Comparison tests\r\n\r\nThe second difference is compared to the working Ant-based tests. In Ant-based projects set up to work properly, the Javadoc navigation is the same whether you're selecting a method where it's used in an application, or you're selecting the same method where it's defined in a library.\r\n\r\nIn this Non-Modular Maven project, the toolbar button to open the Javadoc in an external Web browser is enabled when you select a method where it's used, but the button becomes disabled when you select the same method where it's defined. This occurs for both JavaFX 13.0.1 and JavaFX 14-ea+2.\r\n\r\n**Javadoc where used**  \r\n![javadoc-from-app](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1413266/69367635-7bf6ac00-0c4d-11ea-99af-08b290448712.png)\r\n\r\n**Javadoc where defined**  \r\n![javadoc-from-lib](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1413266/69367646-8022c980-0c4d-11ea-93f1-ea790bfb45d7.png)\r\n\r\nThis is not a new problem—just something I had not noticed in my earlier tests.\r\n\r\nI'm fine with this pull request being merged. We can open new issues for the problems I found.\r\n\r\n@zimmi, for what it matters, I'm fine now if you rewrite commits. I finally understand that NetBeans merges the pull request history directly into *master* as-is, so it really does matter what's there. My limited experience is with OpenJDK projects, which forbid forced pushes, discard the pull request history, and add only a single fast-forward commit to *master*. I assumed that all projects worked in a similar manner, so I couldn't understand why an author would even bother to tidy up the pull request history. I think I understand better now, and I'm sorry for my ignorant assumptions.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/557233309/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/557249338","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1632#issuecomment-557249338","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/1632","id":557249338,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NzI0OTMzOA==","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-21T20:02:17Z","updated_at":"2019-11-21T20:02:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks sane.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/557249338/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/557251235","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1631#issuecomment-557251235","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/1631","id":557251235,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NzI1MTIzNQ==","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-21T20:07:32Z","updated_at":"2019-11-21T20:07:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Change looks sane.

There are many small things to improve, it's great to have them all written down. I also have two smaller things regarding the toolbar button:\r\n\r\n- External Javadoc for methods with more than one parameter that was generated with `javadoc`9+ always opens at the top because the anchor ids changed in that version, see e.g. `stage.addEventHandler(EventType.ROOT, null)`. \r\n- Opening remote JDK Javadoc via the toolbar doesn't account for the module prefixes: it opens https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html but it should be https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Object.html. That's the same issue as the JavaFX Javadoc, but the fix doesn't apply to remote URLs yet.\r\n\r\nSpending a bit more time in the debugger, I found that replacing `JavaSource js = JavaSource.forFileObject(fo)` with `JavaSource js = JavaSource.create(cpInfo, fo)` in [ElementJavadoc::getElementDocFromSource](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/blob/master/java/java.sourceui/src/org/netbeans/api/java/source/ui/ElementJavadoc.java#L842) allows nb-javac to find the parent class of `Stage` and correctly render the `@inheritDoc` for `stage.show()`. `cpInfo` seems to represent the classpath of the current project, whereas `JavaSource::forFileObject` creates a more targeted classpath [here](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/blob/master/java/java.source.base/src/org/netbeans/modules/java/source/parsing/JavacParser.java#L253). Doing this breaks the Javadoc for JDK classes though, so some more investigation of the differences is needed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/557322750/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/557357320","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1548#issuecomment-557357320","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/1548","id":557357320,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NzM1NzMyMA==","user":{"login":"jgneff","id":1413266,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTMyNjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1413266?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgneff","html_url":"https://github.com/jgneff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgneff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgneff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgneff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgneff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgneff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgneff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgneff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgneff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgneff/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-22T02:18:16Z","updated_at":"2019-11-22T02:18:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":">  `cpInfo` seems to represent the classpath of the current project, whereas `JavaSource::forFileObject` creates a more targeted classpath [here](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/blob/master/java/java.source.base/src/org/netbeans/modules/java/source/parsing/JavacParser.java#L253).\r\n\r\nCould that be the reason `{@inheritDoc}` works so well when I list individual JAR files and their Sources directly on the Classpath in an Ant project?\r\n\r\n![compile-time-libraries](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1413266/69392240-3efcda80-0c8a-11ea-8186-dfe2b77cc385.png) ![javadoc-stage-show](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1413266/69392182-0a891e80-0c8a-11ea-8937-768f20d0e71b.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/557357320/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/557498607","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1617#issuecomment-557498607","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/1617","id":557498607,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NzQ5ODYwNw==","user":{"login":"neilcsmith-net","id":3975960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3975960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net","html_url":"https://github.com/neilcsmith-net","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-22T11:33:34Z","updated_at":"2019-11-22T11:33:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@matthiasblaesing assuming we are pushing some updates to 11.2, could you do a cherry picked PR on top of `release112` for this?

Presumably it implements a smaller subset of SVG features than Batik. The SPI introduced in this PR would make it possible to switch out the Batik-based module with a svgSalamander-based one, in case anyone wants to try this at a later point.\r\n\r\n(In FlatLaf, it looks like FlatSVGIcon is only used from the DemoFrame, not in the LAF itself.
