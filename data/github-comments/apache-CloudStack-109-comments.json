Not only could we rid ourselves of the additional code to override the structure, conforming wider Java idioms and standards it easier for new contributors to understand the codebase.  @wido I agree with your suggestion to make one bulk change.

You are correct, `final` has nothing to do with garbage collection -- it is about thread safety.  There are very few (and rare) circumstances where a `static` reference should be mutable because it accessible across thread boundarys.  When they need to be mutable, special care must be taken to ensure exclusive access (e.g. `synchronized` blocks, `ReentrantLock`, `AtomicReference`, etc).  Therefore, I always put the two together.  In this case, the logger is a constant value and should be declared `final`.  Sacrificing thread-safety for unit test is not an appropriate trade-off in my opinion.\n\nStepping back a bit, why are we investing so much time and effort to test a `DEBUG` log message?  `DEBUG` level messages should only be for developers during development of the system.  Not only is a low value item to test, it makes the test case brittle as there should never be any guarantees about log messages at ``DEBUG` and `TRACE` log levels.  In my opinion, @syed should remove this part of the test entirely.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/215620806/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/215645435","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1515#issuecomment-215645435","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1515","id":215645435,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNTY0NTQzNQ==","user":{"login":"milamberspace","id":3995882,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5OTU4ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3995882?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/milamberspace","html_url":"https://github.com/milamberspace","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milamberspace/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milamberspace/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milamberspace/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milamberspace/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milamberspace/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milamberspace/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milamberspace/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milamberspace/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milamberspace/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-29T07:20:58Z","updated_at":"2016-04-29T07:20:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@swill Now the Jenkins build works, but the Travis failed with:\nNo output has been received in the last 10m0s, this potentially indicates a stalled build or something wrong with the build itself.\n...\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/215645435/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/215651932","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1496#issuecomment-215651932","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1496","id":215651932,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNTY1MTkzMg==","user":{"login":"abhinandanprateek","id":12134381,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTM0Mzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12134381?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhinandanprateek","html_url":"https://github.com/abhinandanprateek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhinandanprateek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhinandanprateek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhinandanprateek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhinandanprateek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhinandanprateek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhinandanprateek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhinandanprateek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhinandanprateek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhinandanprateek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-29T07:52:18Z","updated_at":"2016-04-29T07:52:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@swill rebased it.
