I can see that there's a YAML manifest in the repo - however is there a Docker image publicly available which we can use that has this executor built into it?\r\n\r\nAlso, is there a way to use this executor so that each individual DAG task can be run in a separate container pod with a different image? I have a run of DAGs that have varying dependencies that I currently separate out with venvs, but with Kubernetes, I was looking to separate out the tasks by Docker images instead.\r\n\r\nI also feel that this and the postgres database should be deployed with Helm instead of static manifest files.

There's no official docker image yet, however you can currently run docker build on scripts/ci/kubernetes/docker/Dockerfile to build the image. Once the PR is merged I think it would be good to discuss where that official docker image would live.\r\n\r\n2. Yes actually! That is one of the main features we are releasing with this new executor :). please check the `example_kubernetes_executor.py` file to see an example of running with a custom docker container.\r\n\r\n3. The deployment currently in the code-base is for the travis tests so it doesn't really require a custom deployment. I think integrating it with helm is a great idea.\r\n\r\n4. The pods vs. jobs discussion has gone on for a while. The problem is that jobs will run repeatedly until they pass. This could be potentially disastrous in the context of an airflow job (imagine you have a script that launches a spark job that keeps failing).\r\n\r\n@Fokko @bolkedebruin apologies that there has been some delay on the final steps. I was waiting for https://github.com/bloomberg/airflow/pull/44 to be rebased so I could merge it before we merge, but I think this can wait and we can PR against master once the main PR is merged. I will do the final rebases and clean up requested so we can start the alpha testing.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/370605717/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/370638516","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3008#issuecomment-370638516","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3008","id":370638516,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MDYzODUxNg==","user":{"login":"sebradloff","id":7495006,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0OTUwMDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7495006?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebradloff","html_url":"https://github.com/sebradloff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebradloff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebradloff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebradloff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebradloff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebradloff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebradloff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebradloff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebradloff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebradloff/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-06T02:21:28Z","updated_at":"2018-03-06T02:21:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@agrajm Love the post! \r\n\r\nTo deal with the Mesos python eggs issue, we've built an upstream docker image for the version of Mesos we use (1.4.0) and then simply use the docker multi stage build to copy over those eggs from that image. We plan on getting that together and releasing the pattern within the next 2 weeks once we've got the MesosExecutor running.\r\n\r\nRegarding the `docker_image_slave` setting, it would be really cool if we could also specify memory and CPU constraints on a per Operator or DAG basis so that we're optimizing our resources to the fullest. Correct me if I'm wrong, this is my interpretation based on the source code. Full disclosure we haven't run the MesosExecutor yet but just confirmed running the LocalExecutor in a deployed environment with s3 remote logs and external psql metadabase.\r\n\r\nTotally understand the need to specify docker as a containerizer for Mesos agents, but what's the reasoning behind needing `mesos` listed as a conatinerizer? Reading [the docs](http://mesos.apache.org/documentation/latest/containerizers/)  I'm not sure I follow how specifically the Airflow MesosExecutor setup would require the `mesos` containerizer assuming Docker provides all the control you would need.\r\n\r\nI think an amazing addition to that post would be an architecture diagram of what all this looks like. I took a shot at it here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sfbZ7W14BeYvqoOCupvB8vADuDQY1Xmt/view Basically something that gives a picture of the architecture that you need to standup and making it clear that tasks are spun up dynamically in containers.\r\n\r\nPlease lmk if there's anything else I can help with. Really want this to succeed and help make this all easier to understand for those that come along. Overall, I can feel the shift of infrastructure people being tasked with operationalizing airflow in more than just \"one massive EC2 instance\". Anything we can do to make this workflow more easily understood will be a win for data scientists and infrastructure teams.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/370638516/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/370700826","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3102#issuecomment-370700826","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3102","id":370700826,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MDcwMDgyNg==","user":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-06T08:22:58Z","updated_at":"2018-03-06T08:22:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@dan-sf Please fix your line endings.

I traced back on the warning message you provided, and definitely agree that the failure is caused by my PR.\r\n\r\nIn the past we only send SIGTERM to the child processes of `airflow run --raw`; after this PR, it also sends SIGTERM to the root process itself.  Unfortunately, I think we rely on `airflow run --raw` to update the ti state, so there's a race condition now between the process setting the ti state to fail, and the signal killing that process.. (probably why I can't replicate it locally). I think one potential fix is to let the task runner handle the ti state update when it's terminating the process.. but not 100% sure if it would have other side effects or if it even makes sense. Given it's a core change, so I'd want to see how @mistercrunch and @bolkedebruin feel about this. \r\n\r\nAlso note that the query you mentioned above should not return more than 1 row because the primary key of the TaskInstance is task_id + dag_id + execution_date, so the db guarantees its
