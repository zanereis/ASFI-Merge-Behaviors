I believe the referenced `sla_miss` failures were a red herring, with the actual errors being flake8 issues (my fault) and an existing python2 compatibility issue exposed by the new tests (lack of the `dict.copy` function).  I then broke things more with my first attempt at fixing the python2 issue, since I thought the affected data structure was a list.

Otherwise the impression we get from your Operator code is `the Operator is always creating database/collection, no matter if it exists`, which is not correct.\r\n\r\nCurrently, your logic checking if database/collection already exists is \"hidden\" in your `hook.create_database`/`hook.create_collection`. What I would suggest is to have separate method in your Hook, say `hook.if_database_exists`/`hook.if_collection_exists`, to check if database/collection exists, then invoke them explicitly in your Operator, like\r\n\r\n```python\r\nhook = AzureCosmosDBHook(azure_cosmos_conn_id=self.azure_cosmos_conn_id)\r\n\r\nif not hook.if_database_exists(self.database_name):\r\n    hook.create_database(self.database_name)\r\n\r\nif not hook.if_collection_exists(self.collection_name):\r\n    hook.create_collection(self.collection_name)\r\n```\r\n\r\n(inside your `hook.create_database`/`hook.create_collection`, still good to keep try-except).\r\n\r\n**BTW, seems something is wrong with your rebasing**. Please check.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/444325047/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/444326544","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4265#issuecomment-444326544","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4265","id":444326544,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NDMyNjU0NA==","user":{"login":"tmiller-msft","id":15082844,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDgyODQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15082844?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmiller-msft","html_url":"https://github.com/tmiller-msft","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmiller-msft/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmiller-msft/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmiller-msft/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmiller-msft/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmiller-msft/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmiller-msft/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmiller-msft/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmiller-msft/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmiller-msft/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-05T01:42:18Z","updated_at":"2018-12-05T01:42:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ah yes, I see what you mean..

It would simplify my work and also allow for better modularization of applications. Currently, most plugins are kept in this repo, or kept in other repositories and have to be manually copied.
