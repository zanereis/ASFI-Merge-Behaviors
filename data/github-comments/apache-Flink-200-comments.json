The assumption was that there is only a single modifying thread. This actually also applies to the `ResourceManager` itself.\r\n\r\nWhen another thread calls `ResourceManager#shutdown`, then it will shutdown its components, then stop itself (the stopping happens concurrently) and then modifies its internal state (from the calling thread which is not necessarily the main thread). Since we don't wait until the actor has been stopped, the state clean up can lead to a concurrent modification exception.\r\n\r\nIn order to solve the problem I would propose the following:\r\n1. Make `RpcEndpoint#shutDown` non blocking and change the semantic that it initiates the shut down of the `RpcEndpoint` instead of shutting down all internal services.\r\n2. Use the `Actor#postStop` to call an `internalShutDown` method of the `RpcEndpoint` where we close the services.\r\n3. Wherever `RpcEndpoint#shutDown` needs to be blocking, obtain the termination future of the `RpcEndpoint` and then wait on it.\r\n\r\nThat way it should also be possible to call shut down from within the `RpcEndpoint's` main thread and still guarantee a proper service shut down.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/318115295/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/318241335","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3829#issuecomment-318241335","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3829","id":318241335,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxODI0MTMzNQ==","user":{"login":"lincoln-lil","id":3712895,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MTI4OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3712895?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lincoln-lil","html_url":"https://github.com/lincoln-lil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lincoln-lil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lincoln-lil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lincoln-lil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lincoln-lil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lincoln-lil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lincoln-lil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lincoln-lil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lincoln-lil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lincoln-lil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-27T02:34:50Z","updated_at":"2017-07-27T02:34:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @fhueske, agree with you, this API change should be discussed on dev mailing list.\r\nIncluding:\r\nadd two new method to`table.scala`\r\n- `def insertInto[T](tableSink: String): Unit`\r\n- `def insertInto[T](tableSink: String, conf: QueryConfig): Unit ` \r\n\r\ndeprecate the current `sql` method and add two new methods to `TableEnvironment`\r\n- `@deprecated def sql(sql: String): Table`\r\n- `def sqlQuery(sql: String): Table`\r\n- `def sqlUpdate(sql: String, config: QueryConfig): Unit`  After thought it over, I think the method here is different from Jdbc's executeUpdate which returns a `int` value, because `sqlUpdate` will not trigger an execution immediately,  so keep the return value as `Unit` sounds reasonable and doesn't breakdown the consistency of Scala and Java APIs .\r\n\r\nIt's a good idea to call `SqlParser.parseQuery()` distinguishing `SELECT` queries from `INSERT` or `UPDATE` queries.\r\nI'll start a DISCUSS thread ASAP.\r\n\r\nThanks, Lincoln\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/318241335/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/318273287","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4401#issuecomment-318273287","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4401","id":318273287,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxODI3MzI4Nw==","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-27T06:40:59Z","updated_at":"2017-07-27T06:40:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/318273287/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/318296507","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4262#issuecomment-318296507","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4262","id":318296507,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxODI5NjUwNw==","user":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-27T08:34:05Z","updated_at":"2017-07-27T08:34:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks

I found many problems with current approach. It returns only the first match in a stream in most cases.\r\n\r\n1. Let's analyze a pattern `A B C` with `SKIP_TO_FIRST C` and a sequence `a1 b1 c1 a2 b2 c2`. It will return only `a1 b1 c1` and will left the NFA without any valid `ComputationalStates` which results in stopping processing.\r\n\r\n2. Another problem is we do not handle a matches that can potentially finish before previously started. E.g. for Pattern \r\n\r\n```\r\nPattern<Event, ?> pattern = Pattern.<Event>begin(\"ab\").where(new SimpleCondition<Event>() {\r\n\t@Override\r\n\tpublic boolean filter(Event value) throws Exception {\r\n\t\treturn value.getName().equals(\"a\") || value.getName().equals(\"b\");\r\n\t}\r\n}).followedBy(\"c\").where(new IterativeCondition<Event>() {\r\n\t@Override\r\n\tpublic boolean filter(Event value, Context<Event> ctx) throws Exception {\r\n\t\treturn value.getName().equals(\"c\") && ctx.getEventsForPattern(\"ab\").iterator().next().getPrice() == value.getPrice();\r\n\t}\r\n}).setAfterMatchSkipStrategy(new AfterMatchSkipStrategy(AfterMatchSkipStrategy.SkipStrategy.SKIP_PAST_LAST_EVENT));\r\n```\r\n\r\nand a sequence `a(price = 1) b(price = 2) c(price = 2)`. I think a desired behaviour would be to start new matching after `c` event, but it won't as the matching started at `a` and will not start at `b`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSome general notes:\r\n\r\n1. I think the SQL's specification does not suits well into CEP's library as we do not operate on a partition/bounded collection of events. The specification on the other hand assumes such bounded data. I think we would benefit from some additional documentation how the AFTER_MATCH clause works in case of unbounded data. E.g. what does **_empty match_** mean:\r\n\r\n> Note that the AFTER MATCH SKIP syntax only determines the point to resume scanning for a match after a non-empty match. When an empty match is found, one row is skipped (as if SKIP TO NEXT ROW had been speci ed). Thus an empty match never causes one of these exceptions.\r\n\r\netc.\r\n\r\n2. I really don't like the idea of so many cases when `RuntimeException` can be thrown. I feel the reason for using CEP is a constantly running jobs that search for patterns in a stream rather than ad-hoc queries. \r\nE.g in case of a Pattern like `A B? C` with `SKIP_TO_LAST B` a sequence like `a c` results in an exception and the job being killed. In my opinion it does not suits well into constantly running job. From operational side running such Patterns would be at least interesting ;), as they depend so much on the arriving data.\r\n\r\n3. I don't know the reasoning, but Esper, that was mentioned as the other(besides Oracle) library that supports `MATCH_RECOGNIZE` clause does not support `AFTER MATCH` at all.\r\n\r\n4. I found out there was already an ongoing work to introduce part of the `AFTER MATCH` (the `SKIP_PAST_LAST`). The corresponding jira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-3703 and closed PR: #2367 .\r\n\r\nTo sum up thanks @yestinchen for the work. Unfortunately I think the clause needs a little bit more conceptual discussion before we can introduce this change. I think the `SKIP_PAST_LAST` behaviour would be very helpful (in fact there were alread requests for it in the mailing list) and the most straight forward to implement. I would love to here your opinions @yestinchen as well as @kl0u and @dianfu.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/318350950/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/318354533","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4296#issuecomment-318354533","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4296","id":318354533,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxODM1NDUzMw==","user":{"login":"dianfu","id":5466492,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjY0OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5466492?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu","html_url":"https://github.com/dianfu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-27T13:00:05Z","updated_at":"2017-07-27T13:00:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@dawidwys Thanks a lot for the review.

It's impossible to know whether there are potential matches. \r\n\r\nI think the best way to implement this correctly is try to start a new match process after processing each event, and discard unfinished match process after a successful match according to the skip strategy. In order to do that, we need to keep the logical order of the events, which is the original idea I proposed. \r\n\r\nAs for your general notes, I have some ideas:\r\n\r\n1. I agree that the Oracle's specification is designed for bounded data. But match recoginize in unbounded data is very similar to bounded data, since all data are being processed one by one, and there's no need for bound information. As for **_empty match_** , I think we can just use Oracle's definition.\r\n> Some patterns permit empty matches. For example:\r\nPATTERN (A*)\r\ncan be matched by zero or more rows that are mapped to A.\r\nAn empty match does not map any rows to primary row pattern variables; nevertheless, an empty match has a starting row. For example, there can be an empty match at the first row of a row pattern partition, an empty match at the second row of a row pattern partition, etc. An empty match is assigned a sequential match number, based on the ordinal position of its starting row, the same as any other match.\r\n\r\n2. I feel uncomfortable with the RuntimeExceptions too. But these exceptions are very important to keep the skip semantics right. I understand your main concern is that Exceptions will stop the matching process, which is unacceptable to online streaming service. To address this, I think we can introduce a default strategy(SKIP_TO_NEXT_EVENT, for example). If these exceptions happens, we can use default strategy to continue the match process, and change the strategy back after a successful match. We can also add a switch to let user decide whether to enable this feature.\r\n\r\n3. I still think it's useful to support these skip strategies. Don't know why Esper does not support them.\r\n\r\n4.

I saw your remark for \"If a query specifies ORDER BY ... FETCH x ROWS ONLY, then the query must emit exactly x rows (given that the result has at least x rows) and not x rows for the same sort key\"\r\n\r\nTo some extend we had this discussion before when we started this topic. Yes - offset/fetch refer to global/absolute values - there must be 5 elements emitted overall if we have offset 1 and fetch 5. However, as you are saying it is not particularly useful if we enable this for the stream. Take 5 elements and then do not emit anything. This was the reason why the conclusion of the initial discussions on this topic was to have the mandatory orderby time...and then basically the restrictions of offset/fetch will re-apply for each timestamp. That was also the reason why we were retracting the previously emitted results and send the updated results.\r\nHence if you want to write a sql query over the stream to take the top 5 results based on some sort you would write\r\n\r\nSelect * from stream1  Order by rowtime, field1 Limit 5\r\n...this would  ensure that at moment 1 you get the top 5 results\r\n...then at moment 2 you get an update that these 5 results are not relevant anymore (as time changed) and you get the top 5 results relevant at that moment.\r\n\r\nPlease reconsider this. I think this is the behavior that we need (and the one we discussed that is compatible with SQL semantics ... and also relevant). Without this and just having a function that selects at some point x results and then does nothing (or skips y results and then nothing for the rest of the existence)...i do not see the relevance. While, with this syntax or some similar syntax...we would still need to support such functionality also via SQL. \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/318677050/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/318691516","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4407#issuecomment-318691516","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4407","id":318691516,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxODY5MTUxNg==","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-28T15:55:23Z","updated_at":"2017-07-28T15:55:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"the changes for FLINK-7281 look good.\r\n\r\nAs for FLINK-7290, you didn't adjust the existing release script.

If you want to support a certain behavior, we need to see how this can be expressed in standard-compliant SQL and then think about the implementation. The semantics of `ORDER BY rowtime ASC FETCH 10 ROWS ONLY` are given and will return the ten *first* (first because they have the lowest timestamp) result rows.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think what you are trying to achieve is represented by `ORDER BY rowtime DESC FETCH 10 ROWS ONLY`. This query returns the ten *last* (last because they have the highest timestamp) rows of the result. Obviously, we need retraction to handle this case, because the ten last rows will change over time. `ORDER BY rowtime DESC OFFSET 10` is also not very useful, because it holds back the 10 last result rows. However, we could support it to fill the gap in the syntax and execute the query instead of saying \"Sorry, can't do that\".\r\n\r\nSo the question now is, how do we proceed with this PR? Do we want to add the `ORDER BY rowtime ASC OFFSET / FETCH` functionality as simple additions to the existing operators (as I said I think it can be done with very few lines if we do some refactoring) to fill the syntactic gap or not?\r\n\r\nRegardless of whether we add this or not, we should work on the `ORDER BY rowtime DESC OFFEST / FETCH` case.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/318889857/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/318917291","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4284#issuecomment-318917291","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4284","id":318917291,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxODkxNzI5MQ==","user":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-30T17:44:03Z","updated_at":"2017-07-30T17:44:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Travis passed.

For example there can be 5 managed keyed state handles and 7 managed operator state handles and zero state handles for the raw state. Then how would you split that up between the `OperatorSubtaskStates` in your set? Like this, `OperatorSubtaskState` contains the complete state for an operator subtask which I think is a good thing.
