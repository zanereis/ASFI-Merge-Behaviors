It’s been a while \nbut I think this was ready to merge; the main issue is to have \nmaintainer attention, testing and publishing a new release, etc. (As you \nmay have noticed this library has been on a back-burner pace, so also if \nyou feel like contributing yourself, extra hands are most welcome.)\n\nHearing that people use this software is a good motivator to put a bit \nmore effort into it. In case you’d like to share, I am curious whether \nyou use the highlighter or more of annotator, in what way, and what \nwould be required to make it better for your use case.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-annotator/issues/comments/2076967186/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-annotator/issues/comments/2079130171","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-annotator/pull/135#issuecomment-2079130171","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-annotator/issues/135","id":2079130171,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBIM4r8577QI7","user":{"login":"AdamMYoung","id":23509173,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTA5MTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23509173?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamMYoung","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamMYoung","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamMYoung/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamMYoung/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamMYoung/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamMYoung/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamMYoung/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamMYoung/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamMYoung/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamMYoung/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamMYoung/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-26T10:36:44Z","updated_at":"2024-04-26T10:36:44Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hey @Treora, not to worry. I've adopted this library at work for building out an annotator for HTML documents we receive, and it's been fantastic so far. As a work around I ended up abstracting this away in a similar way as your PR, and querying the `mark` tags with `document.getElementsByClassName` and a unique class identifier, so no worries there.\r\n\r\nThe only real issues I've ran into is around tables really which I believe was mentioned in an issue somewhere, but have worked around it by iterating down through table cells and highlighting text nodes manually (which isn't very performant, but works well enough for our use case). \r\n\r\nOther than that, it's all been smooth sailing.
