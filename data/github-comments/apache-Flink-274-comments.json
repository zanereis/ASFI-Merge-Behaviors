I also wrote the same comment at the associated JIRA but I also include it here.\r\n\r\nIn general, as I said earlier, I like the idea of having Callbacks to notify when a file changes state.\r\nAs far as the design/implementation of the current PR is concerned, the following are my comments:\r\n\r\n1) The `FileStateChangedCallback` seems to be pretty limiting, and probably designed with a specific usecase in mind. It assumes that the user would like to do sth with the underlying file system when the file changes state (e.g. write a special file). But other usecases may need to do a REST call, or update a DB, or in general communicate with another system.  \r\n\r\nGiven the above, I would suggest that the function should have an `open()` and a `close()` method which are called once and are responsible for allocating and freeing resources. The `open()` should potentially take the `flinkConfig` as argument and initialize any long-living resources, e.g. connections to databases, a connection to the filesystem, etc, and the close should be responsible for freeing them. This will allow the sink to accommodate a broader variety of usecases. Now for the methods themselves, I do not yet have a definite answer on what should be included as argument, but I would also include a `Context` as an argument. This will allow for future-proofing the method, as we will be able to add stuff in the `Context` if we want to expose more stuff in the future, rather than deprecating the already existing API and creating a new one.\r\n\r\n2) IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS to keep in mind: all this is a \"best-effort\" reporting of state changes, as, for example, if a failure happens after transitioning a file to its \"final\" state, but before calling the hook, then you will never get the notification. This behavior is aligned with Flink's metric system, where metrics are not checkpointed. In our case though, the scenario described above is more tricky to accommodate as we are talking about integration with external systems.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think about the above!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/429244062/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/429244166","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6821#issuecomment-429244166","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6821","id":429244166,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyOTI0NDE2Ng==","user":{"login":"StefanRRichter","id":2128543,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjg1NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2128543?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter","html_url":"https://github.com/StefanRRichter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-12T08:16:06Z","updated_at":"2018-10-12T08:16:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM
