It's even more \"constraining\" for core developers.

The changes to SubDagOperator may be released in Airflow 2.0\r\n\r\nHi @kaxil  thank you for you suggestions and comments. For this particular problem I described in [AIRFLOW-5648](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5648), I ended up dealing with it using a simple approach. I created a function `duplicate_sub_dag()` that makes a copy of the portion of the DAG that I need to rerun. This works great for now. If anyone is interested in what `duplicate_sub_dag()` I can share the code.  \r\n\r\nThe problem in [AIRFLOW-5648](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5648) could be easily solved like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    A >> C >> E >> G >> H >> I >> J >> K >> L >> M >> Finish\r\n    B >> D >> F  >> G\r\n\r\n    Sensor >> duplicate_sub_dag(dag, A.task_id, J.task_id) >> K\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, there's another type of problem that I still can't find a good solution for. And I think several other people in the Airflow community are having similar needs: Whenever we use `ExternalTaskSensor` to set up a dependency on a different DAG, and then someone clears the task that the `ExternalTaskSensor` depends on, there's no way for Airflow to clear the `ExternalTaskSensor` automatically.  A quick search found someone trying to ask about this problem in [AIRFLOW-2279](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2279). The approach in this PR can be easily adapted to solve that problem although some more discussions and opinions are probably needed to make it fit Airflow better. I'm going to put up a separate PR to propose a solution for [AIRFLOW-2279](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2279).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/555353514/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/555401489","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6599#issuecomment-555401489","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6599","id":555401489,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NTQwMTQ4OQ==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-19T08:59:00Z","updated_at":"2019-11-19T08:59:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Without those changes, we have cyclic dependencies in this PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/555401489/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/555401836","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6595#issuecomment-555401836","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6595","id":555401836,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NTQwMTgzNg==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-19T08:59:57Z","updated_at":"2019-11-19T08:59:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"and 2.7 :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/555401836/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/555402601","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6595#issuecomment-555402601","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6595","id":555402601,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NTQwMjYwMQ==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-19T09:01:56Z","updated_at":"2019-11-19T09:01:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"One small problem with it -  this is for the \"released\" version and is taken directly from the PyPI.

@feluelle - but also @kaxil and @coufon as a lot of cyclic import problems were caused by DAG serialization, so please take a close look - maybe I overlooked something.\r\n\r\nI indeed went back to the drawing board and I think I fixed the problems with cyclic imports in simple, and elegant way. I yet have to fix migration for serialization table and run the tests, but I have all the reasons to believe, that the changes I made (mainly in imports but also few other places) are good and they will lead to much nicer and easier-to-reason-about code.\r\n\r\nHere is the detailed description of the changes:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThere were a number of problems involving cyclic imports in\r\nAirflow's core. Mainly about settings, DAG context management, base operator\r\nimports and serialisation.\r\n\r\nSome of those problems were workarounded by #pylint: disables (for pylint),\r\nsome of them were bypassed with TYPE_CHECKING (for mypy) and some of them were\r\njust hidden because pylint check was splitting file lists while TravisiCI\r\nbuild.\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes most of the problems (only executor problem is left) and\r\nremoves all the workarounds.\r\n\r\nThe fixes are:\r\n\r\n* Context for DAG context management was loaded from settings and\r\nNow context managemen is moved to DAG and 'import settings' is not\r\nneeded in baseoperator, subdag_operator.\r\n\r\n* Serialized Fields are lazy initialised - they were previously\r\ninitialized while parsing the python modules which made it impossible to avoid\r\ncycles.\r\n\r\n* SerializedDagModel is removed from 'airflow.models' and imported\r\ndirectly from serialization package. This is only internal class and does not\r\nneed to be exposed via models\r\n\r\n* BaseOperator in core is imported from baseoperator package\r\nrather than from 'airflow.models'. This helps in importing the whole airflow\r\n__init__ of 'airflow' without having to pay attention\r\nto the sequence of imports there.\r\n\r\n* BaseOperator on the other hand is imported from 'airflowi.models' in\r\noperators/DAGs/hooks/sensors.
