I have implemented it, which is much friendly to Zipkin. Read this, https://github.com/apache/skywalking/blob/master/docs/en/setup/backend/backend-storage.md#elasticsearch-6-with-zipkin-trace-extension\r\n\r\nThe reason I proposed this, is Zipkin trace can't transfer to SkyWalking segments perfectly. That is why we put in the document, analysis is not production ready.\r\n\r\n> are there any other way to implement the enhancement?\r\n\r\nThe most important enhancement are analysis metrics from zipkin span. This means, match zipkin client-server span and generated SkyWalking scopes(Service, ServiceRelation, etc.), like `SourceBuilder` used by `MultiScopesSpanListener`.\r\n\r\n> let's say to transform the zipkin format to segments. We should implement a transformer. Is it enough to make work?\r\n\r\nThis may be not necessary.\r\n\r\n> what is the prolems and primary concerns ( in different dimension and details) to implement the functionalities?\r\n\r\nI think mostly is in OAP cluster mode. Zipkin spans of a trace could be sent to the different instances in an uncertain time, so, we need to make client/server match perfectly.  Such as using Redis Cluster to be central cache?(Maybe

But in the short version, SkyWalking has special header and segment formats, very different with Zipkin span based. It is designed particularly for APM, rather than tracing. \r\nI think you can't learn from those about how to analysis Zipkin span. `MultiScopesSpanListener` to `SourceBuilder` is still the best refer. You need to analysis spans, and get all Scopes of SkyWalking, and send them OAL engine. This feature requires clear understanding of what is SkyWalking OAP and OAL scripts.
