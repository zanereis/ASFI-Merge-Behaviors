as noted inline, this is documentation, not a change. Basically, I've found much stronger signal that in zipkin root span is traceid = spanid, vs just absent parent id. Documenting how things work doesn't mean we can't change it.\n\nChanging it will certainly impact code anyway, at least ours, as we need to test things like tree construction don't depend on this. Moreover, I don't know off-hand why traceid=spanid, or if that was just to save a random number generator. If I were to start figuring it out, it would be like many things: searching through git logs of zipkin and finagle, asking people, then dealing with test breaks or missing tests. In other words, this type of issue is better dealt with as a top-level change, than a side bar on documentation polish :)\n\n@theatrus do you remember anything about
