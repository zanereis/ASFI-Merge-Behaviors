I think there might be slightly better way to deal with layouts. \r\n\r\n* Instead of directly using the `transpose` operators, maybe we can use some new annotation ops like `annotate.change_layout` (or maybe use `layout_transform`). This will have a src and dst layout. For each op that goes through legalization, we can have one `change_layout` in the start and one at the end.\r\n\r\n* Now, instead of `propagating` the layout, I would hoist/sink the `change_layout` annotation ops if the ops are layout agnostic. This is similar to Loop Invariant Code Motion (or here, if you allow me, Layout Invariant Code Motion ;-) ). We can hoist these annotated ops as much as possible. Therefore, you would not insert any new ops, you will just try to move them to right place.\r\n\r\n* If done properly, the end state will have back to back `change_layout` ops. Now, a peephole can remove them. And then a realize pass can convert the remaining annotated ops to a sequence of existing Relay ops.\r\n\r\nThis should be able to work for both TF and MxNet, i.e., support both NCHW and NHWC layout.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/522068048/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/522083330","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3394#issuecomment-522083330","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3394","id":522083330,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMjA4MzMzMA==","user":{"login":"tmoreau89","id":5974488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQ0ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89","html_url":"https://github.com/tmoreau89","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-16T17:12:20Z","updated_at":"2019-08-16T17:12:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@liangfu any further steps to get this running on the board?
