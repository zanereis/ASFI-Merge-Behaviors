Thanks @CodingCat for the PR. Looks good to me overall. Left minor comments. I don't have much context with `CommitMetadata`. My understanding is that every time we generate a new snapshot. We will need to inject it if it is there. Is it possible to have the functionality of setting it in a base class of all snapshot producer?\r\n\r\nthanks for the review @flyrain !\r\n\r\nIIUC, you mean we move the code consuming CommitMetadata to a base class so that we will not fall into the situation like this PR tries to address?\r\n\r\n I thought about it when started working on this PR , it may involve a bit refactoring for iceberg-spark ...\r\n\r\n\r\nin the current implementations,  `commitOperation` in [SparkWrite](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/82880be39654bb94aaf370338bdd61f706caa6da/spark/v3.4/spark/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/spark/source/SparkWrite.java#L192)  and that in [SparkPositionDeltaWrite](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/82880be39654bb94aaf370338bdd61f706caa6da/spark/v3.3/spark/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/spark/source/SparkPositionDeltaWrite.java#L259) are pretty much the same ,  we can potentially move them to a base trait, my only concern is \r\n\r\n(1) do we want to do in this PR?\r\n(2) in future, can we guarantee to use the same commit implementation for all snapshot producers (at least in Spark)?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1562207304/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1562213139","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/5659#issuecomment-1562213139","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/5659","id":1562213139,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85dHXsT","user":{"login":"ConeyLiu","id":12733256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzMzMjU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12733256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu","html_url":"https://github.com/ConeyLiu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-25T03:43:00Z","updated_at":"2023-05-25T03:43:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks

I assume we do need the same implementation. Any concern?\r\n\r\nwhat i mean was that if we move `commitOperation` to a base class, can we guarantee we always call the base class's commitOperation in future?
