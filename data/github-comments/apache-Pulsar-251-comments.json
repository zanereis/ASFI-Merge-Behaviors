have re-tested my application where the memory leak happens in a certain load test scenario after applying the #8149 changes on top of a custom Pulsar Client version based on 2.6.1 version. The memory leak still remains. I can see that the CompletableFuture's no longer keep references to ConsumerImpl instances, so that aspect is fixed. \r\nThe instances are still retained from ClientCnx consumers field. I guess this reference was also there before and it might have been that the majority were retained by ClientCnx consumers. \r\n \r\nIt looks like there is a race condition in the way ConsumerImpl is registered / de-registered from the ClientCnx instance when the ClientCnx gets switched. It looks like the reason why the race condition is very likely to happen is that \"Currently the seek() operation will first disconnect all the connected consumers and then reset the cursor.\" (#5278). \r\n\r\nI created a local repro using the Pulsar Client Reactive Streams / Project Reactor wrappers (internal library) that the application uses. This way I'm minimizing the repro step-by-step.\r\nThe current one reproduces the memory leak issue in a case where it creates 100 topics with 3 messages in each. The test case then reads the last message using a reader created with startMessageIdInclusive() and startMessageId(MessageId.latest) . The async API is used and hasMessageAvailableAsync is called before calling readNextAsync to read the last message. A loop of 1000 times randomly picking a topic of the 100 topics and reading the last message in the described way reproduces the issue. This is done concurrently with concurrency level of 16. \r\nI'd have to port the repro to plain Pulsar Client Java code before I could share it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/700413950/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/700418563","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/8156#issuecomment-700418563","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/8156","id":700418563,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwMDQxODU2Mw==","user":{"login":"zymap","id":24502569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTAyNTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24502569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap","html_url":"https://github.com/zymap","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-29T04:27:07Z","updated_at":"2020-09-29T04:27:07Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"/pulsarbot run-failure-checks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/700418563/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/700426819","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/8145#issuecomment-700426819","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/8145","id":700426819,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwMDQyNjgxOQ==","user":{"login":"techzhou","id":304004,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDAwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/304004?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/techzhou","html_url":"https://github.com/techzhou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techzhou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techzhou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techzhou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techzhou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techzhou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techzhou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techzhou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techzhou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techzhou/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-29T04:59:02Z","updated_at":"2020-09-29T04:59:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":" - name: org.apache.pulsar.broker.service.persistent.PersistentSubscription\r\n        level: debug\r\n        additivity: false\r\n        AppenderRef:\r\n          - ref: SubHttp\r\n\r\nIt's OK.

The changes are now ready for review.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the current model used to handle state and state transitions is error prone. The code gets duplicated in several locations and it's hard to be sure if it's fine to unify the behavior in all cases.\r\nPerhaps a model where the state transition triggers \"side-effects\" would be a better way to implement consistent behavior? For example, when the state changes to \"Closed\", certain \"side-effects\" would be triggered.\r\n\r\nI don't have test coverage for the changes I made. It seems that it would be possible to model consumer's state machine and test that it behaves in the correct way.

last status of this issue:\r\n\r\n1. It happens in most cases when we add new consumers and remove old or sometime when any current consumer is disconnected and reconnected becasue of small network interruptions.\r\n\r\n2. We see some unacked messages (1-5 messages. not more) on the subscription level but zero number of unacked messages on every consumer with 1000 available permits\r\n\r\n\r\nMy guess is that these unacked messages belong to the old consumers that already disconnected and went away forever.\r\n\r\nWe tried to sen ackTimout flag without success\r\nWe tried to set setAllowOutOfOrderDelivery=true to set the relaxed ordering policy still without success\r\nWe tried to send ack on every message but still can't avoid this issue\r\n\r\n\r\nSeems that the broker simply stopped dispatching messages and wait for something forever.\r\n\r\nIn order to recover from this situation and resume  the dispatching we need to perform the one of the following :\r\n1. to unload the topic or\r\n2. to disconnected the all connected consumer (all of them!) and reconnect again.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome very strange bug. Seems we need to make the broker to be able to resume dispatching after some timeout despite the fact it has some unacked messages.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions
