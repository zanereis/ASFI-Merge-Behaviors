What's happening is `SegmentLoaderLocalCacheManager.loadInLocation()` takes ~ 100ms at this [line](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/master/server/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/segment/loading/SegmentLoaderLocalCacheManager.java#L235) only for the very first call. That is, only the thread first called this method  takes ~ 100ms and subsequent calls are waiting for the lock to be released after the first call is finished. Once this method is called, I guess some code path is cached (probably generic or code generation part) and subsequent calls are optimized to take less than 1 ms. \r\n\r\n> Looks like getting lock is significant overhead to the methods since it requires acquiring a lock when entering the method - or at least checking whether the current thread already possesses the lock. These operations are quite expensive and they have to be done every single time one of the methods is entered. Since - due to the recursion - this happens a lot, it has an extreme impact on the program performance.\r\n\r\nThis is what I'm suspecting too. Synchronization here is inevitable since we need to support parallel segment loading. So, if this is the case, we should mitigate the lock overhead somehow. However, I'm still not sure what's the root cause. \r\n\r\n> changed NUM_THREAD to 1 instead of 4 (default), full test time reduced to ~500ms from ~5000ms with 4 threads\r\n\r\nThis part sounds like all CPU cores are not being used for tests.

This is already done for stream ingestion in Kafka/Kinesis indexing service. For batch ingestion, we already support ingestion with Hadoop and native distributed batch indexing is also in development (https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/issues/5543). \r\n\r\nFor stream ingestion, I think it's more important to serve as many queries as possible at the same time than faster indexing. That means, most threads should be assigned for query processing rather than indexing. However, in batch ingestion, there's no need to serve queries while indexing, so it makes more sense to apply multi-threaded indexing. Less segment merges sounds great, but it's still unclear to me exactly how this PR and Oak could improve data ingestion performance of Druid. Actually, I thought Oak is for improving query performance of incremental index.\r\n\r\nMy feeling is that my confusion comes from the lack of the [proposal](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Proposal%2C+Design+Review&template=proposal.md&title=).

need.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/502899750/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/502904887","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/7873#issuecomment-502904887","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7873","id":502904887,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMjkwNDg4Nw==","user":{"login":"vogievetsky","id":177816,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzgxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177816?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky","html_url":"https://github.com/vogievetsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-18T01:03:26Z","updated_at":"2019-06-18T01:03:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"You

thanks for all the insightful  questions and comments. Let me chime in :) \r\n\r\nAll-in-all, the motivation for our work is getting data into Druid faster, and making the system performance more predictable over time. How? By using Oak as primary index for data ingestion, and exploiting more of its capabilities over time. Oak is an off-heap data structure, pretty immune to GC, which behaves much better than the JDK concurrent skip list in microbenchmarks (and we keep improving it). The master plan is: \r\n1. Use the Oak-based Incremental Index in the same context as today (single writer thread, multiple reader threads), and show how the ingestion becomes faster with it. As a by-product, Druid will be able to build larger segments, and reduce the compaction rate at the system level over time. But for now, we only look at the segment that is being built. \r\n2. Start using the Oak-based index with more writer threads, to let it really shine (the microbenchmarks show that it becomes more attractive as the number of writers scales). This might require more far-fetched changes, which we might not fully appreciate at the moment, so let's discuss. \r\n\r\nTechnically, the Incremental Index is a complex beast that does many things around the basic fact table management. Therefore, it's nontrivial to show the gains from using Oak immediately. This patch is a step in the direction of goal #2 above - making the whole solution more concurrency-friendly in a way that is independent on the fact table implementation. Doing this will make it easier to merge with the non-blocking Oak code down the road. The benchmark's goal was to show that we don't make things worse, and improve as the number of threads scales. \r\n\r\nDoes this make more sense?

I do hope to eliminate nearly all of these cases in future work by enhancing the type information throughout the query pipeline, but i'm not certain how far in the future that actually is and I haven't had the chance to conduct thorough measurements on performance difference, which is why I brought this up. Also I could see a use for turning off this behavior if certain there are no multi-value dimensions. On the other hand though, we have a lot of options, I'm not sure we need more. Maybe some of the improvements done in this PR, like argument validation for functions being done at parse time instead of for each eval, make up enough for the `RowBasedExpressionColumnValueSelector` phase that it about evens out. Thoughts?\r\n\r\nI wouldn't worry too much about this overhead, for two reasons:\r\n\r\n- Type check overhead should be very minimal in the grand scheme of everything that needs to happen per row during the input binding phase.\r\n- Right now the expression layer is quite inefficient due to not having types known in advance, and this is really just one more manifestation of that. We should be addressing this in a holistic way in the future & so I wouldn't worry too much about any particular instance right now. At this point, we should be able to eliminate the overhead completely.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/503250609/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/503283496","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/7919#issuecomment-503283496","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7919","id":503283496,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMzI4MzQ5Ng==","user":{"login":"clintropolis","id":1577461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzc0NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1577461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis","html_url":"https://github.com/clintropolis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-18T19:45:25Z","updated_at":"2019-06-18T19:59:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hmm, I _really_ like the idea of being able to separately control this stuff for the intermediary segments so mega +1 on that, however I'm not sure how I feel about straight `UNCOMPRESSED` being the default behavior (if I understand this PR correctly).

Even the size difference between using `CompressedVSizeByte` and `VSizeByte` versions of int columns could be very large. I will see if I can dig up some measurements where i collected uncompressed and/or vsize byte packed sizes and share them here.\r\n\r\nSome other ideas have been suggested to help mitigate merging issues like this I think. #5526 suggests adjustments to the merging algorithm that would reduce overall memory usage such as producing the dictionary out of band, and reducing the duplicated number of operations which I would suspect would reduce overall memory usage.\r\n\r\n#7900 additionally suggests another thing we could do that would specifically help the unbounded decompression buffer on merge issue, in the form of doing a sort of hierarchical merge. Since we can measure how many intermediary segments we have with column counts for each, we could calculate how much buffer required and divide merge work up as necessary to keep total usage at a reasonable size. If I understand correctly, it also suggests some similar reworking of merge algorithm as mentioned in #5526.\r\n\r\nThe other thing that makes me think this might not be the best _default_ behavior at least, is that to simply things for new users, the documentation for getting started and smaller cluster tuning suggests running co-tenant middle-manager and historical processes, and I suspect if uncompressed columns size differences are noticeable that this will greatly increase the amount of contention of the os free space between these processes, especially at merge time where all columns of all intermediary segments will be paged in during merge (#6699 again, some related discussion on this in comments). This is already a thing that bothers me about this setup, and I think it could make this issue become a lot worse.\r\n\r\nIt's also totally possible i'm being overly cautious, but I think we need more data before going with these defaults.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/503283496/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/503285276","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/7921#issuecomment-503285276","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7921","id":503285276,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMzI4NTI3Ng==","user":{"login":"clintropolis","id":1577461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzc0NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1577461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis","html_url":"https://github.com/clintropolis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-18T19:50:38Z","updated_at":"2019-06-18T19:50:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":">An alternative to this would be to just leave the data uncompressed (which is supported at indexing time currently), then let the kernel manage the page cache on its own.

So, I am glad that you agree that having different IndexSpec for intermediate persisted segments makes sense.\r\n\r\nNow the real question that affects this PR is whether to change default IndexSpec for intermediate persisted segments or not. \r\n\r\nFrom code perspective it is fairy trivial to retain existing default behavior and I can make that change if that is what most people desire, however here is my rationale for changing the default.\r\n\r\nMy observation on different clusters have been that current indexing task process peak memory usage is much higher compared to average utilization during ingestion due to merge process at the time of publish. Due to that, users plan for task process to have the \"peak\" memory available to it throughout its lifetime.\r\nWhen compression is disabled on intermediate segments, then average memory utilization would increase (more page cache used) but overall peak memory usage would decrease due to no decompression buffers allocated at time of merge. Also, queries would run faster because data is stored uncompressed.\r\nAll said, you are right as above assumptions would not hold on some clusters due to specifics of the datasets that these configurations depend upon , there is no single choice that is good for everyone (or else we wouldn't have those configs :) )\r\nIf we keep existing behavior as default then I'm afraid there would be very few cluster operators who will use the config introduced here to disable compression on intermediate segments. OTOH , with changed default behavior it would be improve things in most cases and where not, they can use the config to get back older behavior.\r\nOr maybe I am totally wrong and problems would show up on different test clusters upgrading to RCs and we will re-instate the old behavior as default in a follow-up PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/503387212/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/503393847","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/7921#issuecomment-503393847","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7921","id":503393847,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMzM5Mzg0Nw==","user":{"login":"himanshug","id":246308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjMwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug","html_url":"https://github.com/himanshug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-19T03:42:15Z","updated_at":"2019-06-19T03:42:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"agree

I am currently trying to reproduce the failure case that is documented in this PR before I consider using this custom image in production. \r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any questions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/503569355/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/503618217","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/7909#issuecomment-503618217","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7909","id":503618217,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMzYxODIxNw==","user":{"login":"vogievetsky","id":177816,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzgxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177816?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky","html_url":"https://github.com/vogievetsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-19T15:48:09Z","updated_at":"2019-06-19T15:48:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Actions should appear here:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177816/59780360-b8714680-926e-11e9-9461-dbaaf564033c.png)\r\n\r\nThe 'action' on segment is `Drop segment (disable)` not drop data source\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177816/59780430-d5a61500-926e-11e9-9835-a2da6633ec45.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/503618217/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/503626339","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/7915#issuecomment-503626339","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7915","id":503626339,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMzYyNjMzOQ==","user":{"login":"vogievetsky","id":177816,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzgxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177816?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky","html_url":"https://github.com/vogievetsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-19T16:08:25Z","updated_at":"2019-06-19T16:08:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Purely from an external standpoint -

The comparison was running IncrementalIngestionBenchmark and inserting 3 million rows which is about 3.8GGB of off-heap data. We have tried giving different off-heap size limits, the result can be seen in the following table.\r\n\r\n[Oak Native Allocator vs Netty.pdf](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/files/3306983/Oak.Native.Allocator.vs.Netty.pdf)\r\n\r\nTo summarize, Netty Allocator requires up to twice memory and when its memory request is satisfied the latency is a bit slower. Looking closer on Netty implementation it is understandable, because Netty Allocator Pools hold buffers in different (exponentially increasing) sizes. This is reasonable for network protocol buffers but less reasonable for data storage.\r\n\r\nBottom line, based on empirical results we would like to continue with the primitive OakNativeAllocator which satisfies the Druid needs and gives better performance. The experiments with Netty Allocator will continue. Thank you for you valuable input!\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/503631910/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/503637331","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/7915#issuecomment-503637331","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7915","id":503637331,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMzYzNzMzMQ==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-19T16:37:58Z","updated_at":"2019-06-19T16:37:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think it is about time to nix it.

No possibility to take the Incremental Index data off-heap. Off-heap memory allows working with bigger memory chunks in RAM without additional performance degradation.\r\n2. Big on-heap memory foot-print. A lot of objects vs serialization.\r\n3. Frequent and slow segment merges.\r\n4. Low multi-thread scalability of queries\r\n\r\n### Proposed changes\r\n\r\nOak (Off-heap Allocated Keys) is a scalable concurrent KV-map for real-time analytics, which has all its keys and values kept in the off-heap memory. Oak is faster and scales better with the number of CPU cores than popular NavigableMap implementations, e.g., Doug Lea’s ConcurrentSkipListMap (Java’s default).\r\nWe suggest to integrate Oak-based Incremental Index as an alternative to currently existing Druid’s Incremental Index. Because Oak is naturally built for off-heap memory allocation, allows usage of much bigger RAM, has greater concurrency support, and should show better performance results.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nA discussion of why this particular solution is the best one. One good way to approach this is to discuss other alternative solutions that you considered and decided against. This should also include a discussion of any specific benefits or drawbacks you are aware of.\r\n\r\nLet’s follow the initial motivation points:\r\n\r\n1. Taking data off-heap allows:\r\n- Working with bigger data without paying the cost of JVM GC slowdown\r\n- Oak allows writing the data off-heap (even with additional copy to off-heap) while increasing the ingestion speed significantly\r\n\r\n2. When working with IncrementalIndex Druid benchmarks and ingesting (for example) 2GB of data, we have encountered that we need to give 10GB more (!) in order to see proper results. Please see the IncrementalIngestionBenchmark results below. OakMap serialize the keys and the values (no object overheads). OakMap metadata is modest and it mostly comes as arrays (again no object overheads). Additionally, OakMap can estimate its off-heap usage precisely.\r\n3. Segment merge in Druid is quite expensive. Segments are merged after (not big) IncrementalIndexes are flushed to disk and then need to be combined. Oak allows to keep more data in-memory giving the same (and sometimes much better) performance. Therefore less flushes to disk (less files requiring merge) may appear. As a future work to OakMaps can be merged while still in-memory.\r\n4. Experimenting with IncrementalIndexReads are still working in progress. However, comparing the multithreading scalability of OakMap with ConcurrentSkipListMap we see that OakMap scales better. So we believe to see that scalability also in Oak-based IncrementalIndex. \r\n\r\n### Operational impact\r\n\r\nThe suggested OakIncrementalIndex should live alongside the current solution, giving the ability to switch to OakIncrementalIndex when preferable. As OakIncrementalIndex doesn’t affect the on disk layout, we do not foresee any specific operational impact.\r\n\r\n### Test plan (optional)\r\n\r\nThe plan is to add a specific unit-test for OakIncrementalIndex and to pass all existing tests for cluster based on OakIncrementalIndex.\r\n\r\n### Future work (optional)\r\n\r\nAs StringIndexer also takes a significant part of IncrementalIndex we might take also this map off-heap.\r\n\r\n### IncrementalIngestionBenchmark results\r\n\r\nIn attached files please see the results of IncrementalIngestionBenchmark when 2 million vs 3 million of rows are inserted. It is done with native Druid’s incremental index and with newly suggested OakIncrementalIndex (data taken off-heap). Druid’s incremental index always gets 12GB on heap memory. OakIncrementalIndex always gets 8GB on-heap and 4GB off-heap (in total 12GB RAM). Please note that the rows come prepared before the benchmark measurement and actually already take big chunk of on-heap memory.
