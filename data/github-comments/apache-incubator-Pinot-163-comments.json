(this is kinda tricky because have to know how many rows for left and right table during sql rewrite \r\n2) Re-order the columns after join. we somehow need to pass an option to join implementation to let join know the re-ordering is happening.\r\n3) We just ignore the error and write in the documentation for the behavior expectation. \r\n4) Write the implementation for right join\r\n\r\nMaybe let's do 4) for now and we can do the rewrite in next iteration?

Yes, there should be only one thread that pushes the segment on the client side. While it could happen that the 1st attempt spends too much time (e.g. due to very slow access to PinotFS) on uploading segment, which made the thread gave up its 1st attempt and retry the segment upload (2nd attempt), and the 2nd attempt succeeded. When the 1st attempt finally finished its work, it turned out that it failed to update the ZK metadata any more. \r\n\r\nSince the client side has already given up the 1st attempt (which leads to the 2nd attempt), the 1st segment upload shouldn't blindly delete the segment. Instead, the 1st controller should validate the crc one more time, and if crc remains the same, segment deletion should be skipped.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1340209523/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1340211110","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/9905#issuecomment-1340211110","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/9905","id":1340211110,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5P4f-m","user":{"login":"jackjlli","id":35080149,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MDgwMTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35080149?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli","html_url":"https://github.com/jackjlli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-07T00:36:21Z","updated_at":"2022-12-07T00:36:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@Jackie-Jiang This PR doesn't intend to fix the `ZKOperatorTest` but it faces the same test failure on `ZKOperatorTest` in Github Actions.
