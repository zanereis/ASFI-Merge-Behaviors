some info about this issue:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1956569/67639892-751b9880-f930-11e9-9219-8f29396bbeae.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1956569/67639888-659c4f80-f930-11e9-8090-ee33caaccb3b.png)\r\n\r\nNow the question is:\r\n`connect` works based on `chart.makeActionFromEvent`. But `connect` is a common feature and use a common way to generate an action from a event. That is, current connect do not know how the charts should be connected accurately. It just use a fuzzy way to connect charts.\r\n\r\nTo solve this problem, probably their are two ways:\r\n\r\n(1) If `connect` do not match the requirement of users accurately, do not use `connect`, but connect charts manually. That is, listen to one chart and convert the `event` to `action parameters` manually (with user customized convert logic) and call `dispatchAction` to the other charts.\r\nThe backwards of the way is that it probably brings lot of burden to users to listen every events the needed (for example, including `highlight/downplay`, `updateAxisPointer`, `hideTip`, ...)\r\n\r\n(2) Enhance the current `connect` feature. Enable it to customize the `chart.makeActionFromEvent` by users.\r\n\r\n(3) Any other ideas?\r\n\r\n@Ovilia @yufeng04 @pissang @The-only
