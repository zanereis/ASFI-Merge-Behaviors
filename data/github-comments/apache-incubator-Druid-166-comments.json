understand your concerns and totally agree that it would be a nightmare to manage in future, if there is some changes inside metadata core classes.\r\n\r\nBut the problem I faced, there are some SQL queries inside in SQLMetadata*** classes, which are not supported by oracle. For Example, Oracle does not have datatype `boolean`, need to use either type `NUMBER` with values 1, 0 or type `VARCHAR` with values \"true\", \"false\". While creating tables, this problem is overcome by overriding the create table methods inside `OracleMetadataConnector` extending `SQLMetadataConnector`. But when running select or update queries need to change used = true to used = \"true\" inside where conditions. Another example is oracle does not have mysql like auto increment, instead need to use sequence by explicitly calling sequence.nextval for create statements. For these, all the insert queries that has incremental ids also need to be updated. But all these queries are inside the core methods. These are some of the reasons behind duplicating core codes.\r\n\r\nIt would have been better if there were some sort of functionality to provide the sql queries to core classes by overriding the core methods just like we have for creating tables inside SQLMetadataConnector. So that main functionality inside core will remain same and It will use the provided SQL
