I would like to take a look and comment.\n\nI am a bit skeptical whether this is going in the right direction. For example, I see no reason why there should be a `SorterMemoryAllocator`, or any specialization for sorters. Ideally, we get also fewer specializations for iterative tasks, not more.\n\nThis looks like many specializations and case distinctions. Flink runs in critical production settings and this memory allocation stuff is super critical, so we can really only merge it when we feel super comfortable that this is (1) rock solid and (2) a good design for the future. Otherwise this will be a lot of code.\n\nTo achieve that, I think it would help to break this down into finer issues and address them one at a time.

I agree this is a super important piece of FLINK where the memory is involved and that is one reason why I wanted to know its managment and usage and wanted to work on this. I have already split this into 2 tasks. One that deals with sorters and another is with the Iterators.\nIn an iterative task I found that memory is being allocated with the iterators and then with the sorters.\nThis PR is only for sorters.\nthe other one is for the iterators \nhttps://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2510/commits/e17462881cc2f0137cc8412eb578fb4c42baeb15\n@ggevay  is sheperding it and helping me out with the idea of making ResettableDrivers which I was not fully sure if it can be done.\nI had added some docs to the JIRA itself about splitting up the tasks and what is being addressed here and how it can be addressed.\n`SorterMemoryAllocators` are nothing but just holders of the memory segments that needs to be passed to the sorters. They hold the memory so that the read buffers, write buffers and large memory buffers can pull in memory and put back the memory to them at the end of each iteration. I initially understood that changing this should have minimal impact on other areas which are not impacted without which it is going to be difficult to review. \nAs said above it was just to show the intention of the changes and I am very much aware that these change needs time to get a thorough review and any design needs to be focussed on future enhancements as I had mentioned in the doc.

Ideally the reporter should not be aware that there are different delimiters at all. It should be handled completely behind the scenes.\n\nFurthermore, using a Map for the delimiters is a bit wasteful; every reporter has an implicit index determined by its position in the list of reporters in the registry, thus we could store the delimiters in a char[].\n\nSomething i thought of was to create a \"front\" metric group for every reporter that is aware of this index. Whenever a metric is registered the referencce to the group it was registered on would be stored in the front.

Would different encodings be used on the same file?\n\nAllow the user to set the character encoding in `CsvReader` which would be applied in `CsvReader.configureInputFormat`?\n\nAre the new tests checking the encoding?

Does that make sense?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/248300108/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/248305707","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2514#issuecomment-248305707","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2514","id":248305707,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0ODMwNTcwNw==","user":{"login":"mxm","id":837221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNzIyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/837221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm","html_url":"https://github.com/mxm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-20T13:46:28Z","updated_at":"2016-09-20T13:46:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Actually, I have written a much better test case for this some time ago, see https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/142912b031df42d2abe43b41e98be5596cb3a7f9/flink-runtime/src/test/java/org/apache/flink/runtime/resourcemanager/ClusterShutdownITCase.java\n\nSo I would only merge the addition to the ResourceManager shutdown.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/248305707/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/248316170","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2304#issuecomment-248316170","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2304","id":248316170,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0ODMxNjE3MA==","user":{"login":"twalthr","id":5746567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDY1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5746567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr","html_url":"https://github.com/twalthr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-20T14:22:56Z","updated_at":"2016-09-20T14:22:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks again for the review @fhueske.

As an alternative solution for too test stability and dead code, may it possible to create another code repository say \"flink-library\" with independent ci?\n\n**BTW: here are the answers to your questions one by one:**\n\n> How complete is the implementation?\n\nSiddhi is a rich-featured CEP and has its own community, and maybe almost the only open source CEP solutions compatible with Apache License. And this library `flink-siddhi` is mainly focused on bring siddhi's capability to flink users seamlessly by:\n- Integrate Siddhi CEP runtime with flink lifecycle\n- Schema and DataStream source mapping\n- State management and fault-tolerant.\n\nSo I think it would be extremely light-weight but useful, and the current implementation should be almost completed. \n\n> Would you be up for maintaining this code?\n\nSure, first of all, personally I am very willing to keep continuously contributing to Flink project in any way.  \n\nAnd also we used siddhi with distributed streaming system a lot in production, and currently considering to support flink as well under consideration of better state management and window supporting. So I would continuously maintain the code if merged, it not, I would maintain as separated project to make sure it's open sourced and workable as well.\n\n> Are you building this as an experiment, or building a production use case based on Siddhi on Flink?\n\nWe use siddhi with streaming environment in production a lot, currently supports storm and spark streaming, and also consider extending to Flink.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/248352875/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/248365403","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2458#issuecomment-248365403","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2458","id":248365403,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0ODM2NTQwMw==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-20T17:03:58Z","updated_at":"2016-09-20T17:03:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"We already gave up Java 6, and setting the source and target version in the Maven compiler plugin already prevents Java 6 usage.

Because by passing MutationActions user can still utilize its API to handle Mutations creation logic which makes it easier to code. I also added a connect() method as @ramkrish86 suggested, but didn't explicitly check existence of table in the code, because once Admin#tableExists is added a NoSuchColumnFamilyException will be thrown during running the example.

I suggest the following changes:\n\n## 1) Renaming the state handle that points to operator state: PartitionableStateHandle -> OperatorStateHandle\n\n## 2) Rename: PartitionableStateBackend -> OperatorStateStore\n\n```\n    /**\n     * User-side interface for storing (partitionable) operator state.\n     */\n    public interface OperatorStateStore {\n\n        /**\n         * Creates (or restores) the partitionable state in this backend. Each state is registered under a unique name.\n         * The provided serializer is used to de/serialize the state in case of checkpointing (snapshot/restore).\n         */\n        <S> ListState<S> getListState(String name, TypeSerializer<S> partitionStateSerializer) throws Exception;\n    }\n```\n\n## 3) Rename: PartitionableSnapshotStateBackend -> OperatorStateBackend. I propose that the term backend now refers to some (i) store with the ability to (ii) snapshot.\n\n```\n    /**\n     * Interface that combines both, the user facing {@link OperatorStateStore} interface and the system interface\n     * {@link SnapshotProvider}\n     */\n    public interface OperatorStateBackend\n            extends OperatorStateStore, SnapshotProvider<PartitionableOperatorStateHandle> {\n    }\n```\n\n## 4) Rename: PartitionableCheckpointed -> CheckpointedOperator\n\n```\n- `storeOperatorState` -> `snapshotState`\n- `restoreOperatorState` -> `restoreState`\n```\n\n```\n    public interface CheckpointedOperator {\n\n        /**\n         * This method is called when state should be stored for a checkpoint.

The state can be obtained from the\n         * provided state store.\n         */\n        void restoreState(OperatorStateStore stateStore) throws Exception;\n    }\n```\n\n## 5) Rename: StateRepartitioner -> OperatorStateRepartitioner\n\n```\n    /**\n     * Interface that allows to implement different strategies for repartitioning of operator state as parallelism changes.\n     */\n    public interface OperatorStateRepartitioner {\n\n        List<Collection<OperatorStateHandle>> repartitionOperatorState(\n                List<OperatorStateHandle> previousParallelSubtaskStates,\n                int parallelism);\n    }\n```\n\n## 6) Add new interface that allows user-friendly checkpointing code for simple cases that to not require custorm serializer\n\n```\n    /**\n     * Simplified interface as adapter to the more complex CheckpointedOperator\n     */\n    public interface ListCheckpointed<T extends Serializable> {\n\n        List<T> snapshotState(long checkpointId) throws Exception;\n\n        void restoreState(List<T> state) throws Exception;\n    }\n```\n\n## 7) OperatorStateBackend lifecycle\n\nAnother point that we might want to discuss is the life cycle of `OperatorStateBackend`. Currently, a new backend is created (+restored) for each invocation of the methods in `CheckpointedOperator`. This always provides a clean backend to take the operator state for a snapshot. I wonder if it could make sense to create `OperatorStateBackend` just once for each `AbstractStreamOperator`, similar to the KeyedStateBackend. This would give users the option to actually keep operator state only in the `OperatorStateBackend`. However, we need a way to signal that all state must be passed to the backend before a snapshot. For example, large operator states could be managed in RocksDB this way, and we could provide more proxy collections (currently we only support a list of substates) over time.\n\nWhat do you think @aljoscha @StephanEwen ?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/248554684/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/248555722","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2452#issuecomment-248555722","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2452","id":248555722,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0ODU1NTcyMg==","user":{"login":"liuyuzhong","id":12843176,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODQzMTc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12843176?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyuzhong","html_url":"https://github.com/liuyuzhong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyuzhong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyuzhong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyuzhong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyuzhong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyuzhong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyuzhong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyuzhong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyuzhong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyuzhong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-21T09:14:03Z","updated_at":"2016-09-21T09:14:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"That's OK.

In order to make this PR mergable, we need to figure out what kind of guarantees it provides under which assumptions / in which scenarios. As an example see the [documentation of the Cassandra sink](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-master/dev/connectors/cassandra.html). This is very important because users will rely on the stated guarantees.\n\nI am not very familiar with HBase and what kind of write semantics and transnational guarantees it provides.

One thing that would be good to change is to remove `SnapshotProvider` and just have that method directly on `OperatorStateBackend`.\n\nI really like the separation between the user facing state store and the backend.

In the end, all state is at an operator, plus there is the existing interface `OperatorState` that is an alias for `ValueState`.

The exactly once semantic can be implemented the way CassandraSink did, storing input records in a state backend and flushing to HBase upon receiving a checkpoint barrier. One thing that might be a concern is the order of execution of these writes are not defined when making such a batch call. In other words, a write of an earlier record could be observed later, but this could be also true even sending each write immediately.
