We can make the test to assert on different expected output depends on the whether the `USER` env variable exists or not. But then I looked the public `resolveAll` method and found it is so trivial and simply calls the other non-public `resolveAll` method. And the non-public `resolveAll` is already covered by the unit test.

@szehon-ho, in your example above shouldn't Thread B's get() call reset the counter in the cache?\r\nAnd if so, then Caffeine should not invoke the removalListener as the object was not removed, so serving the same client pool object should work for Thread B (for another x time duration, 5 mins default AFAIK)\r\n\r\nSimilarly, if the pool object did time out since the last access (done by Thread A), then Caffeine should remove that object, and serve Thread B a fresh one (and in the meantime it may very well call the removalListener on the old one simultaneously, that's fine as Thread B won't have a reference to that)\r\n\r\nTo me it seems like that the scenario that you describe could only go sideways if Caffeine itself is not thread safe with handing out / expiring objects within.

In light of the stack trace above...\r\n```\r\njava.lang.IllegalStateException: Cannot get a client from a closed pool\r\n    at org.apache.iceberg.relocated.com.google.common.base.Preconditions.checkState(Preconditions.java:502)\r\n    at org.apache.iceberg.ClientPoolImpl.get(ClientPoolImpl.java:118)\r\n    at org.apache.iceberg.ClientPoolImpl.run(ClientPoolImpl.java:56)\r\n    at org.apache.iceberg.ClientPoolImpl.run(ClientPoolImpl.java:51)\r\n    at org.apache.iceberg.hive.CachedClientPool.run(CachedClientPool.java:76)\r\n    at org.apache.iceberg.hive.HiveTableOperations.doRefresh(HiveTableOperations.java:203)\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n... this is how I think things happened:\r\n- inside `HiveTableOperations.doRefresh()` we wanted to do a `getTable()` call on HMS\r\n- so we invoked `CachedClientPool.run`\r\n  - this has called `clientPool()` first to get an instance of the appropriate ClientPoolImpl instance, which in this case is a HiveClientPool object\r\n    - this calls `get()` on the `clientPoolCache`, which either creates a new instance or returns a used one, but either way the **clock is reset at this point** (this part is not visible in the stacktrace but should have already happened quite recently)\r\n  - right after we have the instance, we invoke `run()` (and its overloaded `run()` right after)\r\n    - which calls `get()` to get one Client from the ClientPool\r\nAnd this is where the exception happens stating that the whole pool is closed already.. \r\n\r\nWe didn't event get to start working on the Hive operation, we just got `HiveClientPool (ClientPoolImpl)` from the `clientPoolCache` with clock reset on it and attempted to get one `Client` from it, but it was already closed between these couple of frames.\r\n\r\nPerhaps somebody else closed this HiveClientPool, and it was stored in this closed state within the cache, or there's a problem with the cache implementation?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1199900780/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1199940719","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/5377#issuecomment-1199940719","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/5377","id":1199940719,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85HhaRv","user":{"login":"kbendick","id":9833362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MzMzNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9833362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick","html_url":"https://github.com/kbendick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-29T20:58:29Z","updated_at":"2022-07-30T03:06:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I ran coverage.\r\n\r\nThe changes I made in:\r\n- `BaseCatalog` -
