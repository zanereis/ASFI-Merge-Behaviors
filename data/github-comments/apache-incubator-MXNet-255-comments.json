I checked and log the shapes as suggested and realize that it is not the batch size dimension that is lost but the channel one (I had 1 for both, so I didn't realize at first).\r\n\r\nThe network is a u-net very similar as the one describe in the original u-net paper.\r\nEach pixel can be in one of two classes, as in the original paper.\r\nSo, the last layers are:\r\n```scala\r\n    // output\r\n    val conv10 = Symbol.Convolution()()(Map(\"data\" -> conv9, \"num_filter\" -> 2, \"kernel\" -> \"(1,1)\"))\r\n    val label  = Symbol.Variable(\"softmax_label\")\r\n    val so     = Symbol.SoftmaxOutput()()(Map(\"data\" -> conv10, \"label\" -> label, \"multi_output\" -> true))\r\n```\r\nNow, when I run the code to train the network (posted above) with more logging, I get the following:\r\n```\r\n2017-10-03 23:40:37,808 [run-main-0] [UNet] [INFO] - so - Shape: Vector((1,2,868,868))\r\n2017-10-03 23:40:37,897 [run-main-0] [TrainModuleUNet] [INFO] - symbol shape:

However, the error message said that prediction shape is (1, 868, 868). How can this be?\r\n\r\nI also see that my label is likely not in the right shape (one channel, with either 0 or 1 instead of two channels with the probability of 0 and 1). However, the bind function seems ok, which makes me think that there is possibly a implicit conversion done somewhere.\r\n\r\nAnother very strange thing is that the program doesn't really stop after this exception. Memory and CPU usage continue to grow up until I kill sbt. Despite the filed require, the C++ backend continues to work...\r\n\r\nAny hint about how to correctly use SoftmaxOutput with muli_output would be greatly appreciate.

But that dependency is only needed for very specific applications/operators. We (Eric & me) didn't want to have all people in the world that use MXNet already and just trying to update it to a new version to have suddenly their installation failing because they are missing lapack (which they don't need at all). This is the case for Ubuntu 14.04 (as there installing openblas will not install lapack automatically) and potentially other platforms. We rather decided to give a runtime-error for people that use the new functionality.   \r\nSo this is all about making sure that the user community goes through minimal hassle. In the long run, we may phase out that logic, but not now. \r\nIs there any  problem in adding a \"-L/usr/lib64\" directive to LDFLAGS in case that we found lapack being installed in the /usr/lib64?

for replying. Unfortunately, for some reasons, I could not make the code public now. I will try to make some toy codes for reproducing the phenomenon. In fact, I am writing some codes about RCNN, and I suspect ROIpooling, Reshape, FullyConnected might be the causes for low speed with different versions, which I will check myself.
