Changes made between the Script Engine/Body properties stay in place as changes are made and as you move between the standard/advanced editors. I did not experience anything odd there.\r\n\r\nI agree with others about how closing it should return to point from which you came.\r\n\r\nRegarding the save/close behavior - I would not expect 'SAVE' to close as well. It is, however, not very intuitive to save then have to go up the the 'X' button to close it out. Ideally I'd suggest an auto-save behavior that continuously notifies the user their work has been saved after a certain amount of time. Then place a close/done/ok button at the bottom right to close it out. Alternatively, and probably easier, group a separate 'Save' button with the code editor and add a close/done/ok button at the bottom right. There is more of a natural flow that way, working from the top left to the bottom right of the dialog.\r\n\r\nAlso, another idea, with the exception of Jolt these advanced UIs are pretty simple in that you're only choosing a type (engine) then entering code (body). It would be nice to simply have access the code editor directly from the property list when you click the cell to edit the value. This would eliminate the need for the advanced UI.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/345307945/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/345309410","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2269#issuecomment-345309410","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2269","id":345309410,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NTMwOTQxMA==","user":{"login":"moranr","id":14202495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjAyNDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14202495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/moranr","html_url":"https://github.com/moranr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moranr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moranr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moranr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moranr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moranr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moranr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moranr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moranr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moranr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-17T17:29:01Z","updated_at":"2017-11-17T17:29:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"To add to my previous comments, I also notice some styling changes, not only in the advanced UI but other areas of the app as well. For example:\r\n\r\n- Visible elements in the toolbar, status bar, and canvas palettes now have a border-radius being applied; previously they had square corners (i.e., no border-radius)\r\n\r\n- Other areas such as shells and dialogs where the same canvas palette style buttons appear are being affected as well (e.g., 'Open in New Window', 'Close', 'Refresh', etc.)\r\n\r\n- Scott noted the fa-align icon sitting a pixel or two higher - I think this is occurring on many other 'fa-...' icons. I notice shifted positions in the canvas palette buttons, dialogs, and shells too\r\n\r\nI would suggest that unless a new UI component is being introduced, we use established styles to maintain a consistent look. From what I've seen I don't believe there is a need to introduce anything new.\r\n\r\nIn the advanced UIs:\r\n\r\n- the primary buttons (e.g., 'SAVE') have a border-radius now and also as Scott noted some position shifting occurs on hover\r\n\r\n- select/combo box styling is completely different, including the menu that is shown when it is clicked on\r\n\r\n- the 'Format' button should be square as are others that share the same look\r\n\r\nI would also suggest capitalizing 'ruby', 'lua', and 'python' --> Ruby, Lua, Python","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/345309410/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/345360756","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2276#issuecomment-345360756","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2276","id":345360756,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NTM2MDc1Ng==","user":{"login":"mcgilman","id":123395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzM5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman","html_url":"https://github.com/mcgilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-17T20:46:00Z","updated_at":"2017-11-17T20:46:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @sbouchex!

The full build with contrib-check passed.  I have been able to run through the encryption functionality without problems so far.  I have a few comments and questions:\r\n\r\n* I see warnings like \"The service APIs should not be bundled with the implementations\" when starting NiFi:\r\n```\r\n2017-11-19 03:01:29,148 WARN [main] org.apache.nifi.nar.ExtensionManager Controller Service org.apache.nifi.processors.aws.s3.encryption.EncryptedS3ClientService is bundled with its supporting APIs org.apache.nifi.processors.aws.s3.S3ClientService.

The service APIs should not be bundled with the implementations.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs part of the recent restructuring of the nifi-aws-bundle, service interfaces are now defined in the nifi-aws-service-api project, with implementations in one of the other projects.  I think we should move the interface definitions for S3ClientService and S3PutEnrichmentService into the nifi-aws-service-api project.\r\n\r\n* In PutS3Object, I recommend that calling the S3PutEnrichmentService be the very last thing before making the request to S3, to provide the maximum range of modification options.  At the moment, there are some ACL settings that follow enrichment.  Does that make sense?\r\n* Why does the EncryptedS3PutEnrichmentService offer to capture and use the MD5 hash of the key?  I vaguely understood that the AWS SDK would handle the MD5 hash when necessary, which I also understood to be for get requests, and I'm not sure when I would fill it in.  The documentation is not very clear, but [ObjectMetadata.setSSECustomerKeyMd5](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/s3/model/ObjectMetadata.html#setSSECustomerKeyMd5-java.lang.String-) says \"for internal use only\".  The service seemed to work just fine for me without providing it, and it is not described as required.  From line 163:\r\n```\r\n    if (StringUtils.isNotBlank(customerKeyMD5)) {\r\n        putObjectRequest.getMetadata().setSSECustomerKeyMd5(customerKeyMD5);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nWhen would we need this?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/345579321/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/345712284","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2278#issuecomment-345712284","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2278","id":345712284,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NTcxMjI4NA==","user":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-20T14:31:42Z","updated_at":"2017-11-20T14:31:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Reviewing...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/345712284/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/345714751","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2278#issuecomment-345714751","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2278","id":345714751,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NTcxNDc1MQ==","user":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-20T14:40:10Z","updated_at":"2017-11-20T14:40:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"All looks good. +1 merged to master.

For example:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ mvn -T 2.0C clean install -Dhadoop.version=2.8.2 -Dhadoop.guava.version=12.0.1 -Dhadoop.http.client.version=4.5.2 -Dhadoop.http.core.version=4.4.4 -DskipTests\r\n```\r\nThat said, this is a little bit of a lie because in later versions of HttpComponents HttpClient and HttpCore aren't versioned identically and we currently only use a single property hadoop.http.client.version for these; i.e., the hadoop.http.core.version property doesn't exist yet. See [NIFI-4650](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-4650) though.\r\n\r\nSo, I did the build above with the new property and tested with the following jars and things seem to work:\r\n\r\n```\r\naws-java-sdk-core-1.11.68.jar\r\naws-java-sdk-kms-1.11.68.jar\r\naws-java-sdk-s3-1.11.68.jar\r\nhadoop-aws-2.8.2.jar\r\nhadoop-common-2.8.2.jar\r\nhttpclient-4.5.2.jar\r\nhttpcore-4.4.4.jar\r\njackson-annotations-2.6.0.jar\r\njackson-core-2.6.1.jar\r\njackson-databind-2.6.1.jar\r\njoda-time-2.8.2.jar\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe're trying to be very cautious about updating the default to the next major version of Hadoop so it might be best to stick with this still being a property override.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/348250850/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/348254937","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2293#issuecomment-348254937","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2293","id":348254937,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0ODI1NDkzNw==","user":{"login":"threeseed","id":657041,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NzA0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/657041?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/threeseed","html_url":"https://github.com/threeseed","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/threeseed/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/threeseed/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/threeseed/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/threeseed/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/threeseed/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/threeseed/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/threeseed/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/threeseed/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/threeseed/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-30T17:08:38Z","updated_at":"2017-11-30T17:08:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"People like myself who represent very large enterprise customers are looking to run a supported platform in production i.e. HDF.
