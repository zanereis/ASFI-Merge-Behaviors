I'm not sure you can do it in a way that doesn't amount to asserting that poll() is called in commitAsync(). It's really the integration between `ConsumerNetworkClient` and `ConsumerCoordinator` that needs testing. I guess your concern is creeping build time (more than 11 minutes now)?\n\n@13h3r This changes behavior in two ways: (1) the commit will be sent when commitAsync() is called, and (2) commitAsync() can trigger heartbeats. My guess is that (1) is probably how users think this API works anyway. I really can't see a case where a user would depend on commitAsync() _not_ sending the commit. For users who are doing the standard poll loop, the difference won't be noticeable. For (2), this won't affect externally observed behavior at all, except that users won't fall out of the group as quickly ;-).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/199576883/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/199582598","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1110#issuecomment-199582598","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1110","id":199582598,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5OTU4MjU5OA==","user":{"login":"gwenshap","id":1189030,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODkwMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1189030?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap","html_url":"https://github.com/gwenshap","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-22T01:54:53Z","updated_at":"2016-03-22T01:54:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Modified version for the python tests based on advice from @granders. @ewencp - can you take another look?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/199582598/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/199582963","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1108#issuecomment-199582963","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1108","id":199582963,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5OTU4Mjk2Mw==","user":{"login":"ewencp","id":47366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp","html_url":"https://github.com/ewencp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-22T01:55:42Z","updated_at":"2016-03-22T01:55:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@hachikuji I am worried about creeping build time, but also just hoping that it was testable via unit tests because they are much easier to debug/fix if anything changes.

I only mentioned the unit test approach because that test seems to use real versions of `ConsumerNetworkClient` and `ConsumerCoordinator` and I thought the `MockClient` could return a successful indicator for the first commit request and then the `ConsumerNetworkClient` would take care of failing any subsequent requests and invoking the callback.

I think there's more we could be doing internally to mitigate this problem. For example, maybe it makes sense to set a default max.poll.records. Also we currently just block in the send loop after polling the records in receive(), but we probably should abort that loop immediately when the session timeout expires since we'll have no chance of committing offsets anyway. We _could_ try to tackle some of this in this patch, but I'm thinking of opening a separate JIRA since a bigger change will be harder to get into 0.10.
