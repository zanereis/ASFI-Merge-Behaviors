Here's the issue; in every other place where we use stellar (i.e. enrichments) assignment to null implies a variable removal.  In field transformations, assignment to null is noop.  I'm just trying to make them consistent.  We could make both noop, but then we'd remove the ability to have temporary variables in enrichment, which has proven very useful.  Also, if we keep the current functionality, the example above, I'd argue, yields confusing results.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I think this is probably the WRONG behavior in both cases.  What I'd propose, instead, is support within stellar to be able to modify the variables.  I'd propose:\r\n* `REMOVE('field')` would remove the field\r\n* `^=` instead of `:=` would create a temporary variable so you would not need to remember to remove.  e.g. `foo ^= TO_UPPER('casey')` would not be persisted to the message in either field transformations or enrichments.\r\n\r\nI think the current functionality is a bit kludgey, but I think as a stopgap we should at least make them do the same thing and I think removal is the most sensible choice.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/325029901/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/325030234","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/718#issuecomment-325030234","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/718","id":325030234,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNTAzMDIzNA==","user":{"login":"cestella","id":540359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella","html_url":"https://github.com/cestella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-25T20:44:50Z","updated_at":"2017-08-25T20:44:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Currently you cannot have two statements in stellar field transformations with the same variable, so \r\n```\r\n{\r\n\"transformation\" : \"STELLAR\"\r\n,\"output\" : [ \"better_title\", \"title\"]\r\n,\"config\" : {\r\n\"better_title\" : \"title\"\r\n,\"title\" : \"SOME_UDF_THAT_CAN_RET_NULL()\"\r\n,\"title\" : \"if title == null then GET_RANDOM_TITLE()\r\n}\r\n}\r\n```\r\nwould evaluate only the last `title` expression.

Currently, when you start a topology, you can specify certain properties of the topology via the CLI.  These are things like the spout parallelism, number of executors, etc.  Originally these were added to the CLI because they were the things that you needed to adjust to scale a given parser.  What this PR is about is giving you the alternative to specify these topological or structural properties in the parser config in zookeeper.  This enables the admin to specify a config setup for a given instance of a parser in zookeeper without having to specify the CLI options.  \r\n\r\nNow, it bears mentioning that this is also backwards compatible.  For these configuration options mentioned in this PR's description, the order of precedence is:\r\n* CLI\r\n* Zookeeper\r\nwhich is to say that properties specified in the CLI will be honored first.\r\n\r\nIn a post-777 world, you would still have these CLI parameters for the basic topological properties (likely) and the config is still stored in zookeeper, so there really should be no conflict between this and what's going on in 777, I think.\r\n\r\nNow, as to the 'how', well, when starting the parser, in the CLI code, we pull the zookeeper config and figure out the parameters to `ParserTopologyBuilder.build(...)` which gets invoked to construct the parser topology, like it did prior to this PR. \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/325748803/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/325751650","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/709#issuecomment-325751650","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/709","id":325751650,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNTc1MTY1MA==","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-29T18:23:11Z","updated_at":"2017-08-29T18:23:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Assuming your test in Full Dev goes smoothly, my +1 stands.

How often do analysts that have possibly 1000s of alerts find the one magic alert?\r\n\r\nI can imagine a flow in the ui like:\r\n\r\nDo some queries and dig around, select some set of alerts from there to escalate, get an escalate dialog where you add some info, fill out some fields required for target routing etc ( so you need per target config unless you are going to automate it with nifi in-between? ) and then send the alerts as a set.\r\n\r\nAside from that, to restate where I am coming from:\r\n\r\n* it is my exp. that escalateTheseAlerts is preferable and more practical than escalateThisOneAlert\r\n* it is my exp. that most query api with possibly huge returns, paging etc for dense data objects ( remember the original string etc ) try to return contextually appropriate subsets of the data, across different network zones etc for performance etc, and the assumption that what the UI has is what you need to push to the other system is not a good one.  There is def. a tradeoff between optimizing for server-client ( only send what you need to, LDAP comes to mind for example, you get the props you need ) and not wanting to make other ES/? calls to get the real data.\r\n\r\nThese things are worth talking about though.\r\n\r\nAt this point in our REST api, we only have the main readme.
