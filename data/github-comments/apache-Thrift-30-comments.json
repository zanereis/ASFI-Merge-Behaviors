AppVeyor builder with the `MSVC2013` configuration generates large double constants differently as the old `MSVC2010` configuration used to do. So I will add a condition to not do the `TestRenderedDoubleConstants` test on that builder. I also suspect that this problem might be due to the architecture (x86). The result of the `CYGWIN x86` builder will give us some clues on this.
