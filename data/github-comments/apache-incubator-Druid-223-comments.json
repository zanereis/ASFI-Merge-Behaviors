People want to see _something_ as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n@leventov thanks. I think this is the argument. I think people should know it. For an extreme example, no one wants the result of 1% of accuracy. They might not know the exact allowed error bound, but at least they should know a rough one. Then, I think updating the query result progressively is not necessary because, as you said, they want to see the query result as soon as possible. Once the query result shows up and the error bound is allowed, they will just want to do something else rather than waiting for the query result to be more accurate. If this makes sense, the query can be processed by just sampling some segments and returning an approximate result.\r\n\r\nI think this is why the online aggregation hasn't been implemented in any production systems even though it's been almost 20 years since it was introduced.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/465304294/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/465309153","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/7087#issuecomment-465309153","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7087","id":465309153,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NTMwOTE1Mw==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-19T21:04:33Z","updated_at":"2019-02-19T21:04:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I think this is why the online aggregation hasn't been implemented in any production systems even though it's been almost 20 years since it was introduced.\r\n\r\nI think not quite true. Splunk does something like this. I couldn't find documentation on it, but I think the feature is called a \"preview\". It can show time charts and tables that sort of bounce around until they're done being computed, and at that point a checkmark is shown. I found it useful for search results, but annoying for aggregations (since the previewed results can easily be misleading, like a time chart in a totally different shape from how it will end up being).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/465309153/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/465310018","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/7087#issuecomment-465310018","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7087","id":465310018,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NTMxMDAxOA==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-19T21:06:59Z","updated_at":"2019-02-19T21:06:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"In the context of how Druid is usually used, I could see this functionality being useful for topNs that are used for autocomplete or quick-filter widgets (they are sort-of like searches and partial searches can be useful).

I am not very familiar with this area of the code and am definitely guilty of reviewing this change in a superficial manner without verifying that the `other` being in a sparse state was legitimate or not, or having a deeper understanding of the design that went into creating this hll collector in the first place. Maybe this should have been my cue to not get involved in this one 😜 \r\n\r\n> The additional code added to `HyperLogLogCollector` is unnecessary.  It would only ever be executed from tests that create illegal states of the sketch.\r\n\r\nIf I understand your analysis correctly, rather than changing nothing, if the `other` buffer should _never_ be in the sparse state then this check should instead throw some sort of illegal state exception instead of allowing it to explode with `BufferOverflowException`. Explicitly checking for this illegal condition (and linking to this discussion thread in code comments) I think would be beneficial since the `BufferOverflowException` makes it appear is it is an implementation bug rather than a design flaw in the hll collector.\r\n\r\nOther thoughts:\r\n> `storageBuffer.duplicate().put(other.storageBuffer.asReadOnlyBuffer());`\r\n>\r\n> The returned duplicated read-only buffer is never captured or used.\r\n\r\nI don't think this is actually a no-op, [`ByteBuffer#duplicate`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/ByteBuffer.html#duplicate--) makes a new object that points to the same storage as the original buffer.. changes to the original show up in the duplicate, and the other way too, the duplicated buffer just has independent position, limit, etc. So this line is copying the contents of `other` into `storageBuffer`, without modifying the positions or limits of either, meaning the added check from this PR that follows this line adjusts the `limit` of the now modified `storageBuffer` and then densifies it if it is not 'dense' sized.\r\n\r\nIt sounds to me like there are too many design flaws in the hll collector as is to make it worth fixing in terms of _correctness_, since fixing sounds like would break compatibility anyway, so I think we should probably focus on just trying to get users away from using it. But I do think it is worth addressing implementation level things like this in some manner, either allowing design flaws to function as intended, however flawed they may be, or throwing sensible exceptions so users can at least know they have hit the limits of the capabilities of the algorithm, so issues like this don't appear as legitimate bugs in the implementation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/465452225/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/465459440","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/6043#issuecomment-465459440","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6043","id":465459440,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NTQ1OTQ0MA==","user":{"login":"QubitPi","id":16126939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTI2OTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16126939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/QubitPi","html_url":"https://github.com/QubitPi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QubitPi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QubitPi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QubitPi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QubitPi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QubitPi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QubitPi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QubitPi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QubitPi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QubitPi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-20T07:35:56Z","updated_at":"2019-02-20T07:36:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"We concluded that the cause is our application had extremely high memory usage on heap, causing GC-pauses to over-kill Druid process resources.

But I have been rather side tracked with some other things and haven't got back to it yet, so I can at least share my thoughts so far in case they are useful to you or someone else wants to run with it before I can pick it back up.\r\n\r\nBesides selectivity, my limited experiments lead me to think that the type of filter can also drive whether or not a filter should be done as a pre or a post filter, since not all filter value matching is equal. Particularly, things like bloom filters which need to compute a hash per value and test each hash against the bloom filter, the match itself is very expensive for high cardinality dimensions before it even gets to combining the bitmaps. #6633 illustrates that it can be useful in that case to always push to a post filter if the cardinality is high, even if the filter is highly selective.\r\n\r\nThe hard part of this then would be figuring out how to encode this somehow so that the threshold can be a function of how expensive the filter is, assuming such classification is possible or useful in practice and that other filters exhibit a similar patterns to what I was observing with bloom filters which was my main focus so far. By side effect, introducing the idea that filters have some sort of cost value additionally opens up another optimization for evaluating 'and' filters, by giving a sensible mechanism to control the order in which filters are evaluated so that cheaper filters can be evaluated first and non-matches potentially shake out faster.\r\n\r\nIt looks like some effort has gone into selectivity estimation for use with `search` queries in the past, but my gut tells me many of these estimates look fairly expensive, so i'm unsure of their utility for all query types. I have not verified this however, nor am I super familiar with these estimators, so it's possible I'm wrong. I was hoping experimentation would shake out whether or not knowing filter selectivity directly is even necessary. It might be well enough that we know that certain types of filters (selectors and combinations of selectors) should rarely if ever not be pre-filters, while others should generally always skip bitmaps if the cardinality is high enough, perhaps with the threshold adjusted based on how expensive the filter is or not. However, I suspect it's not actually that simple either, but hard to say without further experiments.\r\n\r\nI don't really know what this looks like yet implementation wise, too many unknowns at this point. All testing I have done so far has been very manual. For my next steps, I was planning on setting up a test harness that would let me manually control whether or not filters should use bitmap indexes similar to #6633, but maybe as an option to all filters, and then benchmark with parameters to run under a variety of conditions to find if there is indeed a 'break even' point and how it varies between filter types, overall dimension cardinality, and filter selectivity. But like I said, I'm not sure when I'll get to this, so if this interests you, I say have at it and I'll be more than happy to support with further discussion or review instead in order to see this get done :+1:\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/465459575/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/465461771","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/6365#issuecomment-465461771","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6365","id":465461771,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NTQ2MTc3MQ==","user":{"login":"zhaojiandong","id":5977839,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Nzc4Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5977839?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaojiandong","html_url":"https://github.com/zhaojiandong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaojiandong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaojiandong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaojiandong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaojiandong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaojiandong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaojiandong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaojiandong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaojiandong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaojiandong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-20T07:44:45Z","updated_at":"2019-02-20T07:44:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've merged remote/upsteam/master to my branch and triggered the TeamCity build @gianm ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/465461771/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/465466750","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/6865#issuecomment-465466750","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6865","id":465466750,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NTQ2Njc1MA==","user":{"login":"leerho","id":12941506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTQxNTA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12941506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leerho","html_url":"https://github.com/leerho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leerho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leerho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leerho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leerho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leerho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leerho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leerho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leerho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leerho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-20T08:02:24Z","updated_at":"2019-02-20T08:09:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you for your thoughtful comments.  I looked again at the “noop” line ... and you are right ... I missed it!  But it is a convoluted statement that would have benefited from a code comment!\r\n\r\nI also agree that throwing an exception would make a lot of sense.  That may cause some of the tests that take advantage of the ability to fill the Sketch with illegal sequences to fail.  They would have to be rewritten.  I’m not sure, you would have to try it and see.  \r\n\r\nAn ISE would be fine, as long as the message indicates that the user of the Sketch has done something seriously wrong be feeding the Sketch with an illegal (astronomically unlikely) sequence.  \r\n\r\nThis Sketch implementation is highly vulnerable to accidental corruption because the default hash seed used by the aggregator is zero.  And most people when using hash functions never bother with a seed.  So anybody using the Murmur3_128() in other parts of their code may inadvertently create correlation corruption effects with this Sketch.  And there is no warning!  Unfortunately, I don’t know of any way to detect this or fix it in a compatible way WRT historically stored sketches.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/465466750/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/465592795","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/6349#issuecomment-465592795","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6349","id":465592795,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NTU5Mjc5NQ==","user":{"login":"leventov","id":609240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwOTI0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/609240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov","html_url":"https://github.com/leventov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-20T14:16:13Z","updated_at":"2019-02-20T14:17:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"In retrospect, I think the \"maintenance\" term is too vague and somewhat misleading.

of the challenges I've faced with shading is that it becomes very hard to figure out which version of a library is actually deployed in a production cluster. With reflection (or full classloader isolation), the jars are kept separate and it is easier to debug exactly which version things are coming from. With shading you loose the version information, and can accidentally shade (or neglect to shade) things which should not have (or should have) been shaded.\r\n\r\nIn such scenarios tracking down which version of what libs are getting pulled into which dependencies at what point in the build and deploy process is a huge pain. It is much easier to go \"Oh, I see version X.Y.Z and X.Q.R in the `lib` dir, those must have a conflict\" and then work out how to make them play nice together.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/465662283/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/465663721","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/6996#issuecomment-465663721","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6996","id":465663721,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NTY2MzcyMQ==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-20T16:55:12Z","updated_at":"2019-02-20T16:55:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It could be useful to add a section like that to this document: http://druid.io/docs/latest/development/build.html","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/465663721/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/465665475","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/7010#issuecomment-465665475","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7010","id":465665475,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NTY2NTQ3NQ==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-20T16:59:28Z","updated_at":"2019-02-20T16:59:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I don't know, sorry.

This issue is about a very specific problem: `unionDimensionValueBitmaps()` calls in `BoundFilter.getBitmapResult()`, `LikeFilter.getBitmapResult()` and `Filters.matchPredicate()`, when they literally union 100k bitsets, each of cardinality 1 (in other words, the dimension values are unique). It's just always a very bad idea. Properly in such cases bitmap indexes should be disabled for such columns (see #5402), but sometimes they are not disabled, e. g. in old segments produced by Druid versions that didn't have #5402 yet.\r\n\r\nThere are also less extreme cases when bitmaps are generally shouldn't be disabled, but union should be avoided for particular queries. Imagine that `LikeFilter` or `BoundFilter` ends up unioning bitmaps corresponding to 90% (99? 100?) of values in the dimension in the segment. There is also little doubt that unioning should be skipped in such case. The question is where is that threshold. Even if threshold-based heurstic leads to a suboptimal decision sometimes, it's anyway better to have it than not having any threshold at all. (All query planners generate suboptimal plans sometimes; it's not the reason not to use

My suggestion would provide a means to get the former value, which I think is maybe the better thing to use in Druid world to compare here since data needs to be loaded to be useful, so ... yes I guess? 😅That said, you might need both values if you also wanted to also meter segments that are in deep storage and _not_ loaded, or are trying to bill for all costs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/466235056/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/466296865","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/7119#issuecomment-466296865","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7119","id":466296865,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NjI5Njg2NQ==","user":{"login":"mihai-cazacu-adswizz","id":45362709,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzYyNzA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45362709?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihai-cazacu-adswizz","html_url":"https://github.com/mihai-cazacu-adswizz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihai-cazacu-adswizz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihai-cazacu-adswizz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihai-cazacu-adswizz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihai-cazacu-adswizz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihai-cazacu-adswizz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihai-cazacu-adswizz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihai-cazacu-adswizz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihai-cazacu-adswizz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihai-cazacu-adswizz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-22T07:09:52Z","updated_at":"2019-02-22T07:11:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"There is also no task in `Running Tasks` (Overlord Console) and the EMR has no job running.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/466296865/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/466307474","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/7120#issuecomment-466307474","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7120","id":466307474,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NjMwNzQ3NA==","user":{"login":"kamaci","id":3921885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjE4ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3921885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamaci","html_url":"https://github.com/kamaci","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamaci/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamaci/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamaci/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamaci/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamaci/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamaci/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamaci/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamaci/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamaci/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-22T07:55:41Z","updated_at":"2019-02-22T07:55:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Most other places we add forbidden api entries to prevent such assumptions.
