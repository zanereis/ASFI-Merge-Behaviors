way to have more flexibility and be semantically consistent,\r\nwould be to introduce three static functions to create an\r\nempty configuration, create a configuration from the default\r\nconfiguration file and create a configuration from the file given\r\nas parameter and set the current public constructor to private.\r\n\r\nThe code would be something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nprivate CrailConfiguration() {\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic static CrailConfiguration createEmptyConfiguration() {\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\npublic static CrailConfiguration createConfigurationFromFile() {\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\npublic static CrailConfiguration createConfigurationFromFile(String path) {\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe function `createEmptyConfiguration` instantiates an empty configuration.\r\nThe user can set properties by calling `public void set(String key, String value)`\r\nand `public void setInt(String key, int level)`, two already existing functions.\r\n\r\n`createConfigurationFromFile` instantiates `CrailConfiguration` and\r\nloads the default configuration file. This would be the exact same\r\nbehaviour as the current default public constructior `CrailConfiguration()`.\r\n\r\n`createConfigurationFromFile(String path)` would do the same as the above\r\nfunction, but read the configuration from the explicitely given full\r\npath to the configuration file, instead of loading the default\r\nconfiguration file.\r\n\r\nThis implies a change to the applications.
