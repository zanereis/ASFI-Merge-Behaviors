Another major difference is the much more efficient parametrisation in SegNet [4], which is an order of magnitude faster to run, and can be trained end to end in one step. I believe DeConvNet [1] uses stage wise training and multiple region proposals in inference time.\n\nWe found class weighting to be very important for scene understanding tasks. If you are more interested in datasets such as [SUN](http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/VideoRec/CamVid/) or [CamVid](http://rgbd.cs.princeton.edu/) then I'd recommend implementing it.

I figured this was way less code as this SumAll would need to be converted to a \"loss\" op anyway.\n\nSorry for all the questions, but one more thing: What exactly do you mean by a GradientChecker class? The function itself is stateless so what would go in this class? Utilities to check relative / absolute error like in [theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano/blob/master/theano/gradient.py#L1353)?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/159478880/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/159486599","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/645#issuecomment-159486599","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/645","id":159486599,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1OTQ4NjU5OQ==","user":{"login":"phunterlau","id":1690881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTA4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1690881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phunterlau","html_url":"https://github.com/phunterlau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phunterlau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phunterlau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phunterlau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phunterlau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phunterlau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phunterlau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phunterlau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phunterlau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phunterlau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-25T04:10:25Z","updated_at":"2015-11-25T04:10:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mwegman4 have you tried `brew install opencv` as in the instruction?

During testing, \"for _, label in test_dataiter:\" seems to be unpacking from an iterator (defined as MXDataIter). \n\nAnyway, the sad story is that I have to use mxnet on windows for now and I am using the pre-build version from https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/releases as recommended. Maybe the pre-build version is obsolete. If there is really no other way around, say, the behavior of the iterator class totally changed in the new version, I will bother to compile the latest version from scratch.
