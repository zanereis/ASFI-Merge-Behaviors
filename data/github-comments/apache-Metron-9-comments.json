I'm going to disagree heartily that we should spend much time constructing javadocs for an API that is extremely fluid and changing.  To put it frankly, we are in a state of extreme code churn as we grow the platform and those kinds of docs tend to go stale very quickly.  I would rather see more focus on external documentation on the portions of the stack which are stable.\n\nAt this point in our maturity, we expect a certain ability to grok code by reading it with the judicious help of the integration tests, unit tests and a debugger.  This is precisely why I spent so much time constructing an integration test harness, so we could trace code to better understand it.\n\nTL;DR: Your position around javadocs and general code documentation is not committer consensus and may not (is not IMO) the best approach for this position in our maturity.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/246686685/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/246728641","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/242#issuecomment-246728641","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/242","id":246728641,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NjcyODY0MQ==","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-13T15:51:19Z","updated_at":"2016-09-13T15:51:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The Stellar function is now configured via global properties instead of Capabilities.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/246728641/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/246779027","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/242#issuecomment-246779027","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/242","id":246779027,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0Njc3OTAyNw==","user":{"login":"cestella","id":540359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella","html_url":"https://github.com/cestella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-13T18:34:59Z","updated_at":"2016-09-13T18:34:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"+1, looks good.

Because this test is using low amounts of data, it's prone to a bit of jitter it seems and the compression level specified before isn't sufficient to ensure that the epsilon chosen (1e-2) is sufficient for repeated runs.

This is supposed to fix an issue that you saw last week.

That work continues. Our lack of documentation around Enrichment is making METRON-421 quite painful.  But the link you sent above might help.

Not a deal breaker, but want to get your feedback on it.  If I auto-complete a function, it adds a space after the function name.
