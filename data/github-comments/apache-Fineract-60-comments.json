@wkigenyi superb, as soon as you're ready, I can review it.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to create a cashier \r\n\r\n1. Full Day\r\n2. Not full day (you have to specify the startTime and endTime)\r\n\r\nThe second option does not seem to be supported anymore because when you provide values for fields when creating the cashier you get an error that they are not supported, when you leave them out in the request without setting isFullDay to true you will get an error message saying startTime is required. \r\nI have noticed that the web-app UI does not have provision for startTime and endTime.\r\n\r\nShould I therefore assume that these fields are no longer used when creating the cashier and rewrite the query without considering them?
