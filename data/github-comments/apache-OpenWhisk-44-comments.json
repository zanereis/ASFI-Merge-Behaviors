be good to compile a list of popular languages and work out the \"fast path\" for those developers to go from finishing their microservice to having it running as a Docker Action.** \nThis might mean

From a microservice architecture perspective I think we could be dealing with distinct concerns that could be isolated in distinct microservices should we chose to. API Management may bring extra concerns on top of serverless ones, and I'm listing a few bellow:\n- _restification_ - defining RESTful endpoints -> which I think is what this thread intends to solve, but feel free to keep me honest.\n- _API Facade_ - a pattern for combining multiple endpoints into a single API . I think @mbehrendt might have referred to this when he asked _how would i add more routes to a mapping_\n- _Traffic Management_ -Throttling and Rate limiting plans which are a combination of:\n  - _API plans_ - rules around a single API\n  - _Application plans_ - rules concerning applications that use an API\n  - _User plans_ - rules concerning the end-users that use and application that consumes an API\n- _Application AuthN and AuthZ_ - how do applications authenticate ? API-KEY, OAuth Tokens.\n- _Users AuthZ_ - how to authorize users to consume an API. This is usually in a relation to a _User plan_. ( i.e.  applications may want to limit free subscribers more than the paid ones ) \n\nSo if we implement all these into OW ( starting with _restification_ for now but possibly growing to the other aspects ) then would it make it easy to swap API Management implementations later ?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/252776161/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/252779336","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/1175#issuecomment-252779336","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1175","id":252779336,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1Mjc3OTMzNg==","user":{"login":"mdeuser","id":18535381,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTM1Mzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18535381?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser","html_url":"https://github.com/mdeuser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-11T00:17:24Z","updated_at":"2016-10-11T00:17:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/252779336/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/252833882","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/898#issuecomment-252833882","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/898","id":252833882,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MjgzMzg4Mg==","user":{"login":"domdom82","id":1755853,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTU4NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1755853?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82","html_url":"https://github.com/domdom82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-11T07:26:40Z","updated_at":"2016-10-11T07:26:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Team

longer term, it might be advisable to support .tgz files produced with the `npm pack` command. `npm pack` is smart enough to include \"bundled\" dependencies and exclude files that are not needed for production use (automated tests, build files, README, etc.).\n\nThis would require that `npm install` is run on the .tgz each time, however, if all the required dependencies are bundled, this command is essentially equivalent to just unpacking the .tgz. However, if all the required dependencies are not bundled, the installation will still work (albeit slower due to the overhead of fetching dependencies). At this point, using `bundledDependencies` is an optimization we can strongly encourage to the user through documentation, the aforementioned Yeoman generator, and even log messages when running actions that did not include all the required

Because the Docker Compose can be used not just on Mac but on other OSs as well, I have placed it under its own folder in `./tools/docker-compose`.  \n\nI've also created a [README](https://github.com/ddragosd/openwhisk/tree/fork/tools/docker-compose) with more details.\n\nFor organizations such as mine this proves beneficial as we're not using Ansible, we're going to deploy and run OpenWhisk on top of Apache Mesos, and the way that components such as Kafka and others get installed is different. \n\nDocker Compose's `YML` file makes it easy to understand the components to be executed and it makes it easy to understand the dependencies between them by looking at hints such as `depends_on` or `links`.

See https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/5821\n\nSo I tend to agree with @csantanapr to keep both vagrant and travis in sync. There is one problem with overlay though, because vagrant is still no 3.13 which does not support overlay. So I suggest we stick with aufs for now as it is way easier than to bump the kernel during vagrant up.\n\nOn second note we will be having fun in the test cases that are about to use things like `--pids-limit` to protect from forkbombs. Features like these only work at 4.3 and above so we will have to skip them if the kernel does not support it. I have tested locally and Docker is fine with it. It will print a warning and go on without the feature.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/253155239/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/253193121","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/1334#issuecomment-253193121","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1334","id":253193121,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MzE5MzEyMQ==","user":{"login":"domdom82","id":1755853,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTU4NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1755853?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82","html_url":"https://github.com/domdom82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-12T11:53:29Z","updated_at":"2016-10-12T11:53:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rabbah @sjfink \nfor less disruption: can we do a `docker version` at invoker startup to collect the server version and branch off into the config.json reader if version >= 1.12.x and just keep the old code otherwise? this would be like a feature-toggle and @perryibm would not have to wait until all systems are on 1.12.\n\nwe will probably need to check for kernel version, too. some security features only work on certain kernel levels.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/253193121/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/253195450","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/1388#issuecomment-253195450","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1388","id":253195450,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MzE5NTQ1MA==","user":{"login":"domdom82","id":1755853,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTU4NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1755853?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82","html_url":"https://github.com/domdom82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-12T12:05:51Z","updated_at":"2016-10-12T12:05:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"We will have to hop on to docker_container anyway, even though it does not yet support all features.
