For example `getelementptr` needs to know the \"starting type\" (i.e. the type associated with the input pointer) in order to properly calculate the address corresponding to the index arguments.  In the past, this information was included in the pointer type, i.e. from `i32*`, you could easily infer that the pointee was a `i32`.

Right now, there’s a small subset of committers who do a large amount of shepherding code. These people are the ones whose workflows have been most affected because they are being tagged in nearly everything and can’t sort through the noise. I think that this is a good reason to revert the system where we tag all code owners in the short term.   However, I don’t think that moving to the round robin review where we tag 2 people out of the current code owners list is a good long-term solution. Most of the code owners are not active so the result will pretty much be going back to the way things are where we just tag relevant people and hope they respond.\r\n\r\nBacking up a bit, I think the three main goals of tagging all code owners was:\r\n**G1.** Spread the load of “close reviewing” to more committers\r\n**G2.** Increase visibility across TVM subprojects (i.e., we might want someone who works on automation to look at microTVM PRs (and vice-versa) to make sure that the goals of those subproject are consistent)\r\n**G3.** Give new community members who don’t have a network inside TVM visibility\r\n\r\nTagging all code owners did not accomplish G1, but I think it is helpful in getting us closer to G2 and G3. (Although it is worth noting that I only think it helps us get closer to G2 since it tags so many people rather indiscriminately). If I understand correctly, Manupa, Christopher and Leandro’s concern is that the round robin solution does not accomplish G1 and moves us further from accomplishing G2 and G3. \r\n\r\nI think that (G1) and (G2 and G3) require separate but complimentary solutions. Before talking about those solutions, though, it’s helpful to consider the kinds of reviews that there are in TVM and their purpose:\r\n\r\n**R1.** Review from someone who works closely on this aspect of the project and can provide very specific feedback based on a “close reading”\r\n(Purpose of R1: Ensuring good-quality code and getting it in in time (code shepherding))\r\n\r\n**R2.** Review from someone who is not familiar with this subproject but is doing a “close reading” with the goal of that person gaining domain knowledge of that subproject\r\n(Purpose of R2: Knowledge spreading; creating more people who can do “close readings” of this subproject (creating more code shepherds))\r\n\r\n**R3.** Review from someone with expertise in another part of the project for consistency with overall TVM goals and cross-company / cross-subproject networking\r\n(Purpose of R3: Ensuring project consistency and preventing siloing of groups of contributors)\r\n\r\nTo spread the reviewing load out (G1), we need close reviews from more code shepherds (R1). I think that the easiest way to do this is to **drastically increase the number of committers**. To do this, we should make it a lot easier to become a committer. Specifically, I think we should consider allowing committers to nominate reviewers. Additionally, we should consider having a bot that notifies the community when contributors and reviewers hit certain milestones (like number of PRs submitted, LOC submitted, etc). It would still be up to a committer / PMC member to do the nomination, but this would essentially create a short-list of people to nominate. Another benefit of this is that it will reduce cognitive load on PMC and committers because they don’t need to be watching for who to nominate. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, for community members to gain domain knowledge, they need to be able to do R2s, which means they need visibility into PRs relevant to a certain area. From this standpoint, I think that fine-tuning the code owners of a certain part of the codebase and then notifying all of those code owners is the way to go.  (Also, I think that“code owners” is not the right concept here— ideally the people notified would be everyone who wants to be notified of PRs in that part of the codebase, whether they are contributor, reviewer or committer. This way everyone gets notified for what they want to be notified. As a reviewer I am not pinged as a code owner, even if I would like to be). \r\n\r\nTo increase R3s, it would be nice to do a round-robin where we randomly tag people who are not “code owners” for the part of the project the PR is relevant to (in addition to tagging all the code owners). Ideally we’d limit the number of times someone gets tagged for an R3 review to once or twice a month so it’s not too much and they can adequately engage in the conversation if they want to.\r\n\r\nFinally, I just wanted to clarify that I don't think reviewing people's code should be mandatory in any way. (But like @leandron said it would be helpful to have a way to communicate to the community if you are unavailable). And, I think that auto-tagging people is supplementary to contributors tagging other contributors for review -- we still want people to have working relationships with other contributors). \r\n\r\nIn summary, I think we should:\r\n1. Increase the number of committers by making it easier to become a reviewer and creating a bot that reports contributor milestones.\r\n2. Fine-tune who is notified for parts of the project via some sort of opt-in / opt-out system and notify all of them for PRs in that part of the project. Additionally, we should allow people who are reviewers and contributors to opt-in so that they can keep up with what is going on.\r\n3. Occasionally notify people on PRs for subprojects they don’t regularly work in to facilitate cross pollination and consistency across the project.\r\n\r\nI’m not saying we should implement all of this right now, but I'd like to see us moving towards a world like this (though my thoughts are by no means finalized, so if you have any suggestions / feedback / thoughts please share them!)\r\ncc

My original +1 was based on cursory look at `CODEOWNERS` in which I thought only a smaller subset of `CONTRIBUTORS` (e.g. maybe those who would opt in to lots of code-review notifications) were listed. In fact that's not true; instead:\r\n- there are 42 codeowners, one of them being apache/tvm-committers\r\n- there are 43 committers\r\n- nearly everyone in CODEOWNERS is a committer.\r\n\r\nIn general, having the problems raised by this thread is a positive thing as it means the community and the pace of PRs is growing as adoption increases :). I think many of @electriclilies proposals reflect a need to consider how we might scale the whole review process as the project grows--increasing the number of committers is a way to help with the review load, as are modifications to the way we notify and assign people to code-reviews.\r\n\r\nHowever, I would like to request we focus this thread on the issue being voted on, which I'll attempt to qualify more below. We should absolutely continue discussing on another thread e.g. in the discuss forum or perhaps also at Community Meeting/TVMConf. I personally feel the pain of the current system--I get about 50 notifications per day and properly reviewing them often takes about 3h of time--and would be happy to discuss the broader code-review process more there. There are many days I simply don't have this time, as evidenced by my higher response latency recently.\r\n\r\nTo provide more context on the current thread: there are a number of things contributing to the current situation:\r\n1. Prior to updating CODEOWNERS in apache/tvm#8500, mentions were the primary way to get a committer's attention. The change was intended to provide a more explicit indication to contributors of who might be a reasonable reviewer.\r\n2. In addition to mentions, we also have the \"assign review\" feature of GitHub. Assign is typically used manually to indicate who is shepherding a PR.\r\n3. Then there are review requests, which are similar to assignments but which can be added by non-committers. Prior to apache/tvm#8500, at least my personal experience was that review requests were infrequent.\r\n4. After apache/tvm#8500 landed, review requests became quite frequent (many PRs wound up requesting reviews from a large cross-section of the CODEOWNERS file because the way we've chosen the ownership means that a typical change which spans e.g. `python`, `src`, and `tests` has a good chance of triggering `CODEOWNERS` lines underneath those directories. For example, a relay change which includes an incidental microTVM test fix might result in requesting from a microTVM CODEOWNER. Prior to apache/tvm#8500, an assigned reviewer (either explicitly through GH assignment or implicitly through mention/thread history) could bring in others as was needed.\r\n5. We now have 3 categories which reviewers need to monitor: mentions, assignments, review requests. It seems the GH solution here is notifications; however, both review requests and assignments trigger cause GH to subscribe and thereby notify you. And, we haven't assigned meaning behind a review-request vs an assignment.\r\n\r\nThe root problem exacerbated by apache/tvm#8500 is not so much getting review from a wider set of audience--it's assigning a committer to shepherd the review and own the process of merging it. Now, many PRs have 10+ committers listed as \"reviewers\" (e.g. review-requested). Even with two committers assigned, there is ambiguity in who's shepherding the PR. And, with both review requests and assignments in play, I think people can be getting confused between the two. Compounding the problem, we aren't consistent in our use of assignments--so, there is no authoritative place to look for PRs which a committer needs to shepherd.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of ways to address this shepherd-assignment problem:\r\n1. Through CODEOWNERS, in which review requests suggest an assigned shepherd and one of the reviewers self-assigns.\r\n2. Through mentions or side-channel pings, also a self-assignment.\r\n3. Through project leadership combing through incoming PRs and issuing assignments.\r\n\r\napache/tvm#8500 was an attempt to move from 2 and 3 towards 1. However, I think it has been a bit hampered because CODEOWNERS operates at the directory level but we have not really correctly organized the project to support this style of OWNERS. For instance, the test structure is different than the actual code structure.\r\n\r\nThis vote was originally intended to further address the shepherd-assignment problem by reducing the number of suggested reviewers auto-requested on a PR. Any open source project is going to have committers which are more and less active. My concern with this proposal was primarily that a PR may get a varying speed of review if it's round-robin'd to a less active contributor. Originally I had thought this wasn't likely to be a problem immediately because I'd thought that `CODEOWNERS` was a subset of the committers. It looks like this actually could happen--but, I think there are actually a couple of remedies:\r\n1. First off, a familiar contributor who merely wants a fast review can always mention a committer they work with regularly to nudge them to look. \r\n2. Any committer is free to reassign the review to take shepherding responsibilities.\r\n3. We could consider the [triage role](https://infra.apache.org/github-roles.html) to help here.\r\n\r\nThere has been suggestion that contributors use e-mail filters to help sort the incoming review requests. First off this is something I do and I'm supportive of it; however there are a couple of cases which may cause the filters to be hard to compose (e.g. at least in gmail which many of us use):\r\n1. Some committers get mentioned on tons of reviews which they never find time to comment on.\r\n2. With the current CODEOWNERS, I don't think it's possible to differentiate between a requested review due to CODEOWNERS and a review requested explicitly.\r\n3. There are situations where e.g. you neither were mentioned on a review nor assigned/review-requested but would like to watch a PR.\r\n\r\nCompounding these challenges is time--these conditions may come and go throughout the life of a review. GitHub supports subscriptions for this reason, I believe.\r\n\r\nIn summary, I've gone back and forth in supporting this change (from supportive to unsupportive and now back to supportive given the remedies). I'm not completely sure this is the right thing to do, but wiling to try as I don't think the current fully-automatic system is working that well. I would further support codifying the purpose of assignments/review-requests and considering adopting a project-wide methodology of triaging new review requests (e.g. perhaps utilizing a triage role and indicating who is responsible for this). And, we should definitely continue discussing the process of scaling code-review in other threads, as this is merely one aspect to discuss.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/931579113/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/931595264","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/9057#issuecomment-931595264","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/9057","id":931595264,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM43hwQA","user":{"login":"hogepodge","id":367747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2Nzc0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/367747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hogepodge","html_url":"https://github.com/hogepodge","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hogepodge/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hogepodge/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hogepodge/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hogepodge/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hogepodge/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hogepodge/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hogepodge/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hogepodge/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hogepodge/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-30T19:16:12Z","updated_at":"2021-09-30T19:16:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+0 as someone who is not actively reviewing a large body of code, I don't have a strong opinion on if this is the right move. It's clear that the current \"tag all code owners\" is not workable, and I fully support removing that. To me the big questions is: how do we fairly allocate work amongst the community and code owners. We can look at how other communities have handled this.\r\n\r\nO1) Within the Kubernetes community, code ownership is allocated to Special Interest Groups, and SIG leaders are round-robin allocated to review code under their ownership. Other reviewers can be automatically added also based on codeowners files, and reviewers and assignees can be manually added through tags to bots.\r\nO2) The Rust community allows for volunteers to join a \"high five\" program that automatically round robin assigns them for code review. It's opt-in, and is a way to gain experience and merit within the community.\r\n\r\nEchoing what @areusch was saying, since every pull request needs a review from a committer to merge, I feel we need a way to allocate committers, but it does no good if committers have become inactive and we're just spamming them. Going back to Kubernetes as an example, their three-month release cycle creates a natural period of time where contributors can volunteer for work but be able to step back gracefully if work or personal demands take them away from the project. Looking at O2, I could imagine a quarterly \"call for reviewers\" to give us space to build an equivalent of that \"high five\" list, and for the PMC to review contributions by community members and identify who is active, and who is inactive.\r\n\r\nWithin a community ladder I like to think of what roles and responsibilities people have to be regarded as active in the community. For example, an active reviewer or committer should be maintaining a certain level of reviews, and similarly somone who is not an active reviewer but wants to be promoted should be able to demonstrate an ability to do that. This is somewhat at odds with The Apache Way of doing things, but in my mind it helps to distinguish between active an inactive, as it helps the community in general identify who is there to help, and how to share the work amongst them.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/931595264/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/931609061","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/9057#issuecomment-931609061","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/9057","id":931609061,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM43hznl","user":{"login":"electriclilies","id":17014049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDE0MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17014049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/electriclilies","html_url":"https://github.com/electriclilies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electriclilies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electriclilies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electriclilies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electriclilies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electriclilies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electriclilies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electriclilies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electriclilies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electriclilies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-30T19:38:21Z","updated_at":"2021-09-30T19:45:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@areusch I definitely agree with everything you said.

The problem is that when I'm tuning on a 64 bit host and measuring on a 32 bit edge device, the size_t on the host is a 64 bit value which gets serialized into a byte stream. When the 32bit edge device tries to read that, it thinks the value should be a 32 bit size_t, and ends up corrupting the data stream as it reads it.

originally the request was essentially around the integration tests, which we run in smaller sets (e.g. relay, topi, etc). when a test in the early set fails, results from the later ones aren't reported. this change isn't quite the same--but, it's the same argument as to why you may not want fail-fast; for example, if a test fails in the `ci_arm` container, you may not know whether it's also failing in ci_gpu or vice versa. i agree CI is not a personal testing environment, but it is sometimes the easiest way for developers to access cloud platforms they don't have e.g. arm, gpu.\r\n\r\n@Mousius the comment you referenced is a bit more general and i'm not sure this specific issue contributes to CI taking a while to complete. you can monitor CI if you're anxious for the test results. one effort in progress is the `xdist` which should have a bit bigger impact without potentially making it harder to access a test platform you don't have locally. i'm not opposed to changing CI to improve developer productivity, but could you motivate this specific change a bit more? in practice this seems most likely to result in cancellation of GPU integration tests, but the [number of available GPU executors](https://ci.tlcpack.ai/label/GPU/load-statistics?type=hour) has not been 0 in the past month. perhaps we should track that stat for a bit now that #9128 is in. i am wondering if maybe it already somewhat addressed this concern. \r\n\r\n@jroesch your comment is a bit generic. i still would like to see more rationale as to why cancelling the GPU unit tests when an ARM one fails.
