The result is still quite different from R, and very sensitive to the strength of bias.\n\nUsers may re-scale the features to improve the convergence of optimization process, and in order to get the same coefficients without scaling, each component has to be penalized differently. Also, users may know which feature is less important, and want to penalize more. \n\nAs a result, I still want to implement the full weighted regualizer, and de-couple the adaptive learning rate from updater.
