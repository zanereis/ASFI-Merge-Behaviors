Together with current PR, I believe, they make ipv6 in 4.10 functional, unfortunately your PR wido/ipv6-icmpv6all wasn't included in 4.10 by unknown reason.\r\n \r\nI suppose it's wise to keep current PR, because together:\r\n1. this PR (to merge to 4.11)\r\n2. wido/ipv6-icmpv6all (merged to 4.11)\r\n3. CLOUDSTACK-10138 (merged to 4.11)\r\n\r\nthey do all necessary IPv6+sg work. But I still feel that in security_group.py code should include try-except:\r\n```python\r\n        for ip in rule['ipv4']:\r\n            try:\r\n                if protocol == 'all':\r\n                    execute('iptables -I ' + vmchain + ' -m state --state NEW ' + direction + ' ' + ip + ' -j ' + action)\r\n                elif protocol != 'icmp':\r\n                    execute('iptables -I ' + vmchain + ' -p ' + protocol + ' -m ' + protocol + ' --dport ' + range + ' -m state --state NEW ' + direction + ' ' + ip + ' -j ' + action)\r\n                else:\r\n                    execute('iptables -I ' + vmchain + ' -p icmp --icmp-type ' + range + ' ' + direction + ' ' + ip + ' -j ' + action)\r\n            except:\r\n                pass\r\n\r\n        for ip in rule['ipv6']:\r\n            try:\r\n                if protocol == 'all':\r\n                    execute('ip6tables -I ' + vmchain + ' -m state --state NEW ' + direction + ' ' + ip + ' -j ' + action)\r\n                elif 'icmp' != protocol:\r\n                    execute('ip6tables -I ' + vmchain + ' -p ' + protocol + ' -m ' + protocol + ' --dport ' + range + ' -m state --state NEW ' + direction + ' ' + ip + ' -j ' + action)\r\n                else:\r\n                    if range == 'any':\r\n                        execute('ip6tables -I ' + vmchain + ' -p icmpv6 ' + direction + ' ' + ip + ' -j ' + action)\r\n                    else:\r\n                        execute('ip6tables -I ' + vmchain + ' -p icmpv6 --icmpv6-type ' + range + ' ' + direction + ' ' + ip + ' -j ' + action)\r\n            except:\r\n                pass\r\n```\r\nat least because user can pass wrong icmp type/code and we should handle it at least skipping but not failing all security group configuration. So if you could improve current PR with try-catch I think it's more reasonable than diving into: https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/2320 as it includes several cherry-picks which already in master and it is quite messy and I believe it shouldn't be merged to master. Just for those who willing to make 4.10 work.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/349971327/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/350048098","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/2320#issuecomment-350048098","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/2320","id":350048098,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MDA0ODA5OA==","user":{"login":"GabrielBrascher","id":5025148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjUxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5025148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher","html_url":"https://github.com/GabrielBrascher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-07T18:06:45Z","updated_at":"2017-12-07T18:06:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks,
