Wanna attempt a PR?\r\n\r\nCode location is here: https://github.com/apache/couchdb/blob/d0445f53a837db374e56eb59ede63694ed6e4c33/src/mango/src/mango_error.erl#L330\r\n\r\nWhat you are seeing is a so-called Erlang binary. In particular, it is a three-byte binary with the decimal ascii values of `f`, `o` and `o`.\r\n\r\nThe problem now is that the format specifier `~w` is meant for [Erlang atoms](http://erldocs.com/current/stdlib/io.html?i=0&search=io:format#format/1) or roughly an 8-bit ascii string, not a binary.\r\n\r\nThere are two options now.\r\n\r\n1. typecast the binary into a list (that in this case will map to the `~w` specifier with [`binary_to_list()`](http://erldocs.com/current/erts/erlang.html?i=0&search=binary_to_list#binary_to_list/1)\r\n\r\n2. change the format specifier to something that can render the binary into the string, namely [`~s`](http://erldocs.com/current/stdlib/io.html?i=0&search=io:format#format/1).\r\n\r\nOne challenge arises, and that’s something you can play with: what if the bad sort specifier is not a string, but a JSON structure? Then the above solutions would show some different gobbledygook, or they might not. It might be worth trying a few different ones and see which solution gets you closest to a satisfactory result. If you are looking at solution #2, [check out the other format specifies](http://erldocs.com/current/stdlib/io.html?i=0&search=io:format#format/1), especially `~p`.\r\n\r\nLet us know if you have any questions :)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/340184977/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/340185128","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/926#issuecomment-340185128","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/926","id":340185128,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MDE4NTEyOA==","user":{"login":"janl","id":11321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl","html_url":"https://github.com/janl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-28T11:45:31Z","updated_at":"2017-10-28T11:45:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Agreed this is a bug.

There does not seem to be a way to assign a key to documents in the `_changes` feed so that we can perform the `reduce` function manually. Furthermore, we don't want to transfer all documents over the wire (or even their ids), this would be too much when all we need is a summary (the result of the `reduce`).\r\n\r\n* Mango queries are somewhat limited for our needs. A common operation we perform in documents involves iterating over some of its (object-typed) properties, look for a common property in them, and then extract the max or min value. JS `map` based filtering can be applied in the `_changes` feed by using the `_view` parameter, but this implies having a `_view` created already with the `map` function.\r\n\r\nWe are fans of CouchDB are will not move away from it, but we are disappointed to see this feature removed and being forced to redesign our analysis module, which is a core feature of our system. We do accept any suggestions for alternatives to implement our required functionality in 2.x, besides creating and deleting \"permanent\" views.\r\n\r\nWe also kindly request the development team to reconsider re-enabling temporary views in future versions of CouchDB.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/341111125/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/341144874","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/932#issuecomment-341144874","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/932","id":341144874,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MTE0NDg3NA==","user":{"login":"wohali","id":112292,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjI5Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112292?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali","html_url":"https://github.com/wohali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-01T15:41:47Z","updated_at":"2017-11-01T15:41:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"FYI there is work in progress to add reduce functionality to Mango.
