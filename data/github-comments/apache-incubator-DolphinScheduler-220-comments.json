However for the first point, if there are images of unexpected types, assertion will fail right away. Therefore, we only need to remove images not referenced in the docs directory. Please correct me if I get it wrong.\r\n\r\nGood catch, you're right. Maybe we only need to dynamic get `expect_img_types` from `docs` directory https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/blob/9f84dbbda00956d5bf198ce7eb4c47f2ea335173/docs/img_utils.py#L35-L38 , cause we

new img type like `*.svg`, we can not get svg path in `docs` by https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/blob/9f84dbbda00956d5bf198ce7eb4c47f2ea335173/docs/img_utils.py#L123-L124 cause our function `build_pattern` do not get it from directory `docs`, and sub command `prune` will remove `*.svg` file when I run it.\r\nFor now I have to add `svg` into `expect_img_types` to fix
