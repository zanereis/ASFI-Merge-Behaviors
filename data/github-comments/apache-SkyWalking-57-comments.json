Text is here, links are not working in comment, but right in doc md.\r\n\r\n____\r\n# Trace Data Protocol v2\r\nTrace Data Protocol describes the data format between SkyWalking agent/sniffer and backend. \r\n\r\n## Overview\r\nTrace data protocol is defined and provided in [gRPC format](../../../apm-protocol/apm-network/src/main/proto).\r\n\r\nFor each agent/SDK, it needs to register service id and service instance id before reporting any kind of trace \r\nor metric data.\r\n\r\n### Step 1. Do register\r\n[Register service](../../../apm-protocol/apm-network/src/main/proto/register/Register.proto) takes charge of \r\nall register methods. At step 1, we need `doServiceRegister`, then `doServiceInstanceRegister`.\r\n\r\n1. First of all, do `doServiceRegister`, input is **serviceName**, which could be declared by any UTF-8 String. The return \r\nvalue is KeyValue pair, **serviceName** as key, **service id** as value. Batch is also supported.\r\n1. After have **service id**, use `doServiceInstanceRegister` to do instance register. Input is **service id**, **UUID**,\r\nand **register time**. UUID should be unique in the whole distributed environments. The return value is still KeyValue pair,\r\n**UUID** as key, **service instance id** as value. Batch is also supported.\r\n\r\nFor register, the most important notice is that, the process is expected as async in backend, so, the return could be **NULL**.\r\nIn most cases, you need to set a timer to call these services repeated, until you got the response. Suggestion loop cycle, 10s.\r\n\r\nBecause batch is supported, even for most language agent/SDK, no scenario to do batch register. We suggest to check the  `serviceName`\r\nand `UUID` in response, and match with your expected value.\r\n\r\n### Step 2. Send trace and metric\r\nAfter you have trace id and trace instance id, you could send traces and metric. Now we\r\nhave \r\n1. `TraceSegmentReportService#collect` for skywalking native trace format\r\n1. `JVMMetricReportService#collect` for skywalking native jvm format\r\n\r\nFor trace format, there are some notices\r\n1. Segment is a concept in SkyWalking, it should include all span for per request in a single OS process, usually single thread based on language.\r\n2. Span has 3 different groups.\r\n\r\n* EntrySpan\r\nEntrySpan represents a service provider, also the endpoint of server side. As an APM system, we are targeting the \r\napplication servers. So almost all the services and MQ-comsumer are EntrySpan(s).\r\n\r\n* LocalSpan\r\nLocalSpan represents a normal Java method, which don't relate with remote service, neither a MQ producer/comsumer\r\nnor a service(e.g. HTTP service) provider/consumer.\r\n\r\n* ExitSpan\r\nExitSpan represents a client of service or MQ-producer, as named as `LeafSpan` at early age of SkyWalking.\r\ne.g. accessing DB by JDBC, reading Redis/Memcached are cataloged an ExitSpan. \r\n\r\n3. Span parent info called Reference, which is included in span. Reference carries more fields besides \r\ntrace id, parent segment id, span id. Others are **entry service instance id**, **parent service instance id**,\r\n**entry endpoint**, **parent endpoint** and **network address**. Follow [SkyWalking Trace Data Protocol v2](Trace-Data-Protocol-v2.md),\r\nyou will know how to get all these fields.\r\n\r\n### Step 3. Keep alive.\r\n`ServiceInstancePing#doPing` should be called per several seconds. Make the backend know this instance is still\r\nalive. Existed **service instance id** and **UUID** used in `doServiceInstanceRegister` are required.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/440203914/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/440205539","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/1724#issuecomment-440205539","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/1724","id":440205539,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MDIwNTUzOQ==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-20T09:34:35Z","updated_at":"2018-11-20T09:34:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Fix
