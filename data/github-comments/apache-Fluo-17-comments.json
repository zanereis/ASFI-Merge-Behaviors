Not all commands would need this additional method. `execute()` can call this method and do any necessary printing. APIs and UIs can use the public method. For example `FluoStatus` could look like this\r\n```java\r\n@Parameters(commandNames = \"status\",\r\n    commandDescription = \"Prints status of Fluo application for <app>\")\r\npublic class FluoStatus extends AppCommand {\r\n\r\n  public enum AppStatus {\r\n    NOT_FOUND, RUNNING, STOPPED\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @Override\r\n  public void execute() throws FluoCommandException {\r\n    AppStatus appStatus = status();\r\n    System.out.println(appStatus);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public AppStatus status() {\r\n    FluoConfiguration config = getConfig();\r\n    try (FluoAdminImpl admin = new FluoAdminImpl(config)) {\r\n      if (!admin.zookeeperInitialized()) {\r\n        return AppStatus.NOT_FOUND;\r\n      } else if (admin.applicationRunning()) {\r\n        return AppStatus.RUNNING;\r\n      } else {\r\n        return AppStatus.STOPPED;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n`FluoWait` and `FluoInit` will probably be a little tricky, especially since `FluoInit` can read input from `System.in`.\r\n\r\nFor 3 we can simply add setter methods for all the options.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/574491855/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/581090727","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fluo/issues/579#issuecomment-581090727","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/579","id":581090727,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MTA5MDcyNw==","user":{"login":"jkosh44","id":10800303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODAwMzAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10800303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44","html_url":"https://github.com/jkosh44","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-02T02:32:03Z","updated_at":"2020-02-02T02:32:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think this issue can be closed with the -f option in [FluoInit](https://github.com/apache/fluo/blob/master/modules/command/src/main/java/org/apache/fluo/command/FluoInit.java).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/581090727/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/596143707","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fluo/pull/1088#issuecomment-596143707","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/1088","id":596143707,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NjE0MzcwNw==","user":{"login":"kennethmcfarland","id":29900332,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTAwMzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29900332?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennethmcfarland","html_url":"https://github.com/kennethmcfarland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennethmcfarland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennethmcfarland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennethmcfarland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennethmcfarland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennethmcfarland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennethmcfarland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennethmcfarland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennethmcfarland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennethmcfarland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-07T22:26:59Z","updated_at":"2020-03-07T22:26:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hello,\n\nIve been out for a while with health issues sapping energy but saw this.\n\nKeith should remember a very similar race condition we tracked to Curator.\n\nWhen we changed the recipe it fixed the race condition.

(https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.7.2/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/SingleCluster.html#Setup_passphraseless_ssh), but you may have to confirm with the Hadoop or setup logs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/596664073/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/596713006","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fluo/issues/1084#issuecomment-596713006","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/1084","id":596713006,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NjcxMzAwNg==","user":{"login":"flyingcanopy","id":26763271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzYzMjcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26763271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyingcanopy","html_url":"https://github.com/flyingcanopy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyingcanopy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyingcanopy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyingcanopy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyingcanopy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyingcanopy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyingcanopy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyingcanopy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyingcanopy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyingcanopy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-09T18:40:02Z","updated_at":"2020-03-09T18:40:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ctubbsii you were right , I checked the logs and the issues seems to be with not having passwordless authentication. \r\n\r\nThis did the work\r\n`\r\nssh-keygen -t rsa -P '' -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa \r\n`\r\n`\r\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys\r\n`\r\nCurrently I am able to access uno shell.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/596713006/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/596815804","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fluo/issues/1084#issuecomment-596815804","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/1084","id":596815804,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NjgxNTgwNA==","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-09T22:48:54Z","updated_at":"2020-03-09T22:48:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> @ctubbsii you were right , I checked the logs and the issues seems to be with not having passwordless authentication.\r\n\r\nGreat!

I was looking at the proposed solution and I think it has the following problem. \r\nImagine you start a worker at 10:05 and then you start an oracle at 10:15. If you call fluo list it will show that the application is running and the start time is 10:05. If you then stop the worker and call fluo list again, it will show that the application is still running but the start time has changed to 10:15. So for any application whenever the oldest worker/oracle is stopped the start time would change.\r\n\r\nAnother possible solution I was thinking of was storing start time as metadata in a ZNode under the app's root path. However I think this is full of concurrency issues around starting and stopping oracle/nodes at the same time. Basically there would be no good way of dealing with the scenario where there is 1 worker/oracle up, and it is stopped around the same time another oracle/worker is started.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/599239295/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/599710963","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fluo/issues/530#issuecomment-599710963","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/530","id":599710963,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5OTcxMDk2Mw==","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-16T19:06:03Z","updated_at":"2020-03-16T19:06:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"There are definitely alot of concurrency issues with trying to keep an accurate start time.

I thought maybe it had to do with Java 11 issues, but haven't had time to investigate. Fluo shades Thrift, so it shouldn't be a conflict with other dependencies, and the only API breakage was the relocation of TFastFramedTransport to a subpackage. All the tests seem to be hanging/timing out.

The name of the property we use in Fluo to manage the version of the shaded libthrift in Fluo is the same name as the property in accumulo-core. So, when resolving the version of libthrift during integration tests, it picked up the wrong version. It needed the version Accumulo uses, but it picked up the version Fluo had configured. This caused a ClassNotFoundException in Accumulo Maven Plugin, and Accumulo couldn't start for the ITs to
