I was trying to read up on JDBC spec to understand what can be done here.\n\nIn section 13.4.2 of the JDBC 4.1 spec [1] it shows that proper SQL statement escape would be\n\ndate:  `{d 'yyyy-mm-dd'`\ntime: `{t 'hh:mm:ss'}`\ntimestamp: `{ts 'yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss.f . . .'}`\n\nI'm always quite skeptical to see if the JDBC drivers out there _actually_ implement such details of the JDBC spec. Often I have found that implementations are not spot on in that regard. But I think the above could form the basis of a good default. We could override the default in case of deviating JDBC drivers.\n\nOur normal way of handling such deviations is to not rely on the FormatHelper (because it is generic and context-free) but rather rely on the `IQueryRewriter` interface, which actually has the method `rewriteFilterItem(...)` method. There's a hierarchy of classes that implement the interface and the default implementation (which most deviating implementations extend from) does delegate eventually to FormatHelper. But that's what we should change IMO. So instead of changing FormatHelper I would change `DefaultQueryRewriter`.\n\nI would also want to cover this in all of our JDBC integration tests. Those aren't part of the Travis build but once we have a good implementation going then I am happy to test at least on the usual suspect databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, MS SQL Server, DB2 and Oracle.\n\n[1] http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/jcp/jdbc-4_1-mrel-spec/jdbc4.1-fr-spec.pdf\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/148908260/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/148913788","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metamodel/pull/58#issuecomment-148913788","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/58","id":148913788,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0ODkxMzc4OA==","user":{"login":"ankit2711","id":3010530,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMTA1MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3010530?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit2711","html_url":"https://github.com/ankit2711","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit2711/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit2711/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit2711/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit2711/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit2711/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit2711/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit2711/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit2711/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit2711/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-17T12:35:07Z","updated_at":"2015-10-17T12:35:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The build was failing because some tests were added with the use of the below constructor \nnew Timestamp(long milliseconds) and then assertion were applied on the Timestamp in string.

I have only myself used it wrt. COUNT function, but you could also query an approximate AVG function or something like that. This means that \"just\" adding approximate_count would not work - and it would not support people plugging in new functions themselves.\n\nI guess we could introduce it as a first-class keyword like DISTINCT, then it would be `SELECT APPROXIMATE COUNT(*) FROM table` instead ... Not sure I like that better, but it would work I guess.\n\nA word of comfort: People that expect MetaModel to use \"standard SQL\" would probably never set this flag because it is not part of any standard at all.

I have some remarks:\n- The build is breaking on Travis. This should be fixed one way or the other.\n- It's a pity about the dependency still on elasticsearch. But not because of the dependency itself I think, but because it still complicates the code when you build query filter etc. and have to use reflection there. This would be a lot better to build dynamically using a Json request builder of sorts. For me this is not a blocker, but something we should probably make sure to report in JIRA as an improvement we would like to make eventually.\n- There's a lot of code duplication. I don't see a good way out of this though (the obvious would be to have an \"abstract\" E.S. module but that would also be kinda overkill).\n\nI hope this is useful feedback.

I guess that time has come! :)\n- I agree on the ES dependency. I'm not sure the code will be prettier using i.e. GSON, but shedding a huge dependency from a module (or at least making it test-only, we probably wont get rid of the embedded ES node) is always nice. Luckily, our use of the search functionality is rather limited, so I think it should be manageable.\n- I think I might a least be able to make a few things less duplicate-y, like wrapping the client's `IOException` inside `MetaModelException`. The request objects are generic and contains the type returned in `Action<T extends JestResult>`, so a simple wrapper should suffice.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/152835939/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/152942236","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metamodel/pull/68#issuecomment-152942236","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/68","id":152942236,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1Mjk0MjIzNg==","user":{"login":"kaspersorensen","id":291450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTQ1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/291450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen","html_url":"https://github.com/kaspersorensen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-02T07:30:03Z","updated_at":"2015-11-02T07:30:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I also think we should discuss this.

I think this is a good idea, but the PR is a bit questionable in it's current shape, so I hope you would be interested in maybe taking these feedback points?\n\nA few strange things in this PR which I think are technicalies/mistakes, but please clarify:\n- The DerbyTest file already exists in the master branch. Yet on the diff it seems it's been added in full. I can't figure out why that is and if something changed? Did you copy it, change something in it or?\n- The .patch file also seems to be included in this Pull Request. That's also kinda strange.\n\nSo just focusing on the change you've done to FromItemParser (this seems to be the real \"suggestion\"):\n- I would love to see a unittest that uses your new code. We have a lot of existing parsing tests in for instance the class QueryParserTest. You can easily add one or two more cases of parsing with the square brackets.\n- You've removed the final keyword from \"tableNameToken\" and \"aliasToken\" and instead initialized them to empty strings. This seems like a degradation in code quality to me.\n- There's no check on whether the end-bracket is found or not. I can imagine a lot of difficult exception scenarios being thrown there without giving the user proper feedback. We should safe-guard such code quite a lot IMO.\n- The same holds for validation of the alias that may or may not be there. And for the fact that an alias should not have spaces in it.\n- On the code formatting side I have a few remarks:\n  - Mixed use of tabs and spaces in indentation.\n  - No spaces around \"else\" token is not how we format code.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/154881570/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/154977148","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metamodel/pull/67#issuecomment-154977148","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/67","id":154977148,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NDk3NzE0OA==","user":{"login":"LosD","id":1282832,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODI4MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1282832?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD","html_url":"https://github.com/LosD","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-09T07:16:46Z","updated_at":"2015-11-09T07:16:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Reading it again, that was pretty unclear.

For now the question that I am most concerned about is the syntax/API that we expose. The moment we have agreement on that then we can even start with an inferior implementation and consider everything from there on an improvement. But the moment we expose it we also have people using it and expect us to maintain it, so I guess the question is also on what we want to maintain and what we think would be good syntax.\n\nPersonally, I like both syntaxes (double quotes and square brackets) for different reasons (double quotes seems to be the most wide-spread \"standard\" while square brackets is a bit more concise because it has a distinct beginning and end). So I would consider supporting both, in the spirit of MetaModel to \"embrace all\" of the database landscape :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/155147158/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/155152411","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metamodel/pull/72#issuecomment-155152411","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/72","id":155152411,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NTE1MjQxMQ==","user":{"login":"ashwinrayaprolu","id":8037381,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMzczODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8037381?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwinrayaprolu","html_url":"https://github.com/ashwinrayaprolu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwinrayaprolu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwinrayaprolu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwinrayaprolu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwinrayaprolu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwinrayaprolu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwinrayaprolu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwinrayaprolu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwinrayaprolu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwinrayaprolu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-09T18:47:16Z","updated_at":"2015-11-09T18:47:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'll leave this decision up to you..
