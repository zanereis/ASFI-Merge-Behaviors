just two things to think about: \n\n(1) Usually we try to keep the parser(s) free of semantics regarding individual operations. It would be great to have this functionality in the actual validation step. I understand that this piece is pydml-specific and hence moved into the pydml parser. However, maybe it's possible to fill in the missing lower/upper bounds during validate (in a generic manner) but reject missing lower/upper bounds in the dml parser?\n\n(2) Negative ranges: R supports something like X[10:5,] which returns rows 5 through 10 in reverse order. Does python support this too and if yes, how would we define the implicit lower/upper bounds there? I think we should just mention this in the documentation for now, as our runtime/compiler anyway does not support reverse ranges for indexing (yet).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/218334554/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/218365739","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/147#issuecomment-218365739","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/147","id":218365739,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxODM2NTczOQ==","user":{"login":"mboehm7","id":13721609,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzIxNjA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13721609?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7","html_url":"https://github.com/mboehm7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-11T05:32:00Z","updated_at":"2016-05-11T05:32:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@dusenberrymw could you please do me a favor and reproduce this issue with a function that has a scalar/matrix return type?

I looked into doing (1), however, I think that route is going to introduce a lot more confusing logic than simply having it in the initial parser.  If we do this and place it in the validation step of `IndexedIdentifier`, we have to inject state for whether implicit bounds were used (the use of a colon in a statement, such as `X[2:,]`, then override the existing behavior of setting both the upper and lower bounds to the same value if one actual index is received, then add the custom logic for actually injecting the implicit bounds, and all of this is only applicable for PyDML.  I think simply \"filling in\" the implicit bounds for the user when parsing the PyDML and then sending it on to the validation step like normal keeps the code cleaner, at least in this particular example.  Thoughts?\n\nAs for (2), Python doesn't have this functionality.  However, it does have another slicing functionality for having indexes that count backwards from the bounds, i.e., `X[:-1,]` would index all rows _except_ the final row.  This would be good for another JIRA.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/218890405/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/218921938","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/142#issuecomment-218921938","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/142","id":218921938,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxODkyMTkzOA==","user":{"login":"dusenberrymw","id":5431337,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MzEzMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5431337?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw","html_url":"https://github.com/dusenberrymw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-13T00:21:20Z","updated_at":"2016-05-13T00:21:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@niketanpansare Overall, this is awesome!   I created new layers in my library using the new built-in functions internally for convolution and max pooling, and plugged them into all my DML test suites.  The convolution functions work great!  \n\nI did find one problem with the built-in max pooling function: values are always compared to a lower-bounded threshold of `0`, so if a patch has all negative values, the output for the max pooling operation over that patch will be `0`, rather than the maximum negative number in that patch.  I will comment on the line, but a quick update fixes it.  Would probably be good to add a few tests over entirely negative tensors to unit test it.\n\nLooking forward to the GPU & Spark implementations!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/218921938/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/218927436","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/142#issuecomment-218927436","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/142","id":218927436,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxODkyNzQzNg==","user":{"login":"niketanpansare","id":11686380,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjg2Mzgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11686380?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare","html_url":"https://github.com/niketanpansare","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-13T01:06:45Z","updated_at":"2016-05-13T01:06:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @dusenberrymw for your comments.

I will try my best to get the other JIRAs in asap. I understand your concern that people who want to test SystemML on very large models might get a bad impression of SystemML as whole, based on the narrow set of functions. In that case, we have to politely explain them that this is work-in progress and we will get distributed operators implemented soon. On the flip side, this PR (which I believe is somewhat orthogonal to the above JIRAs) will allow the members of SystemML community try out various network on different datasets, refine and optimize the implementation as well as their model and enhance deep learning expertise in our community.\n\nThat said, there are few features that are extremely crucial. For examples: I would be comfortable if we merge this PR with \"WIP\" tag when:\n1. We optimize CP convolution functions for sparse data to somewhat satisfactory degree.\n2. We optimize other CP functions including ba+*, r', max, etc.\n3. We add the layers required to port Caffe's AlexNet and Autoencoder (may be GoogleNet too). This will ensure that this implementation is fairly general enough and not a mock prototype. Examples of remaining layers are LRN, Concat.\n\nSpark/MR and GPU backend would be nice to have but should not stop us from making progress on this front. Anyways, this is my opinion and if others disagree too (or if others won't be trying out additional models in near future), I can be convinced otherwise :)\n\nThe reason I feel this way is because a typical deep learning expert who wants to try out a new framework will use frequently used networks (AlexNet, GoogleNet, Autoencoder, LSTM, etc) on common benchmarks (ImageNet, MNIST, ..) where the model parameters of convolution layers will likely fit on single machine. They will certainly appreciate the flexibility of using larger models on SystemML using our distributed backend. But more importantly, they will also look into whether we are feature complete wrt deep learning (i.e. the layers, initializers, learning rate schedules, different optimizers, preprocessing utility functions, etc.) as well as how much of learning curve there is in trying out SystemML.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/219268323/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/219359296","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/154#issuecomment-219359296","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/154","id":219359296,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxOTM1OTI5Ng==","user":{"login":"Wenpei","id":6813734,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MTM3MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6813734?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wenpei","html_url":"https://github.com/Wenpei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wenpei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wenpei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wenpei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wenpei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wenpei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wenpei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wenpei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wenpei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wenpei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-16T06:37:27Z","updated_at":"2016-05-16T06:37:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"ping @niketanpansare \nIt's a simple doc change.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/219359296/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/219360181","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/108#issuecomment-219360181","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/108","id":219360181,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxOTM2MDE4MQ==","user":{"login":"bertholdreinwald","id":10200727,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjAwNzI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10200727?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertholdreinwald","html_url":"https://github.com/bertholdreinwald","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertholdreinwald/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertholdreinwald/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertholdreinwald/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertholdreinwald/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertholdreinwald/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertholdreinwald/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertholdreinwald/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertholdreinwald/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertholdreinwald/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-16T06:44:38Z","updated_at":"2016-05-16T06:44:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think that it is a good idea.

I created SYSTEMML-610 for this.\n\nAlso, at some point in the near future, I think we will need to restructure the Notebook documentation since it needs to be brought together and made more prominent.

As for the image utils, my preference would be to have those written in Scala/Java & Python as part of `MLContext`.  DML is great for math, but not so great for data wrangling, and especially not with raw bytes ;).  The latter point is important because I don't think we can package MNIST data files directly, and otherwise they have to be processed at the byte level.  For some MNIST examples I'm working on, I just grab them with the TensorFlow utilities. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/219834719/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/219835717","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/160#issuecomment-219835717","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/160","id":219835717,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxOTgzNTcxNw==","user":{"login":"dusenberrymw","id":5431337,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MzEzMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5431337?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw","html_url":"https://github.com/dusenberrymw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-17T20:01:07Z","updated_at":"2016-05-17T20:01:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mboehm7 Thanks for the feedback!  As for the `SystemML-NN` path prefix, my preference would be to keep it, as it signifies a complete neural net library that just so happens to be distributed in the main SystemML repo.  By keeping it, I'll be able to include documentation and examples directly with the rest of the code.  The goal is to promote others to develop libraries for SystemML.\n\nAs for the vectorized functions, that's still on the todo list.
