Some questions from my side:\r\n\r\n1. Can I get some statistical  infomation from profiling results, like what I did in my naive tool:\r\n\r\n    * by op: total time consumed by conv/fc/pooling ...\r\n    * by layer: total time consumed by RNN/LSTM (maybe there is no layer in mxnet)\r\n    * by iteration: total time/memory consumed by one iteration\r\n\r\n2. Which is the most time consuming op instance? \r\n\r\n    * input shape, parameters, output shape\r\n    * in which iteration?\r\n\r\n3. How to profile memory for CPU?\r\n\r\n    * maybe not all memory is allocated in mxnet::storage.\r\n\r\n4. Operator tuning: I saw you have contributed to the operator tuning of mxnet. Seems it will create many omp threads before executing graph. How does this function affect the performance of mxnet? If I have set cpu affinity in my environment, these omp threads will be binded to each core. Then when executing computation graph, many other omp threads will be created and binded again. Do you think that will impact the performance?\r\n\r\nThanks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/360400949/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/360445475","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/8245#issuecomment-360445475","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/8245","id":360445475,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MDQ0NTQ3NQ==","user":{"login":"benqua","id":1128612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjg2MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1128612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benqua","html_url":"https://github.com/benqua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benqua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benqua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benqua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benqua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benqua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benqua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benqua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benqua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benqua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-25T11:54:28Z","updated_at":"2018-01-25T11:54:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"checks have passed!\r\n@yzhliu can you have a look please?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/360445475/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/360452347","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/7873#issuecomment-360452347","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/7873","id":360452347,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MDQ1MjM0Nw==","user":{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-25T12:26:26Z","updated_at":"2018-01-25T12:26:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@apache/mxnet-committers: This issue has been inactive for the past 90 days.

And we can get the execution time of MKL-DNN by setting MKLDNN_VERBOSE=1, [details](https://github.com/01org/mkl-dnn/blob/master/doc/perf_profile.md). \r\nThe output includes lots of very useful information for the performance debug, one example as below:\r\n >mkldnn_verbose,exec,convolution,jit:avx512_common,forward_inference,fsrc:nChw16c fwei:OIhw16i16o fbia:undef fdst:nChw16c,alg:convolution_direct,mb32_g1ic64oc64_ih56oh56kh3sh1dh0ph1_iw56ow56kw3sw1dw0pw1,**1.14307**\r\n\r\navx512_common: the executed instruction set architecture\r\nforward_inference: the convolution type\r\nfsrc/fwei/fbia/fdst: format of input data/weight/bias/destination\r\nalgorithm: the convolution algorithm, direct convolution\r\nmb32_g1ic64oc64_ih56oh56kh3sh1dh0ph1_iw56ow56kw3sw1dw0pw1: \r\n  mb, mini-batch, 32\r\n  g, group, 1\r\n  ic, input channel, 64\r\n  oc, ouput channel, 64,\r\n  ih, input height, 56,\r\n  ....\r\n  1.14307, the runtime of this kernel. \r\n\r\nSo, you can see the output are really meaningful.\r\nI think we can simplify the MKL-DNN output from MXNET side and make it more readable rather than the raw data.\r\n\r\n- **Text Output**\r\nThe text level summary may be not such fancy as the visualization tools. But it's really concise and efficient. The user doesn't need to bother chrome and post-processing json file.\r\n\r\nA very good example is from Theano's profiling tools [example](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/tutorial/profiling.html).\r\n\r\nAs @TaoLv mentioned, this profile includes the runtime from Class, OPs and their instance (Apply).\r\nI really like this kind of format :) and I think @TaoLv 's [tiny tools](https://github.com/TaoLv/mxProfileParser) are following this principle as well.  \r\n\r\n```\r\n Function profiling\r\n==================\r\n  Message: None\r\n  Time in 1 calls to Function.__call__: 5.698204e-05s\r\n  Time in Function.fn.__call__: 1.192093e-05s (20.921%)\r\n  Time in thunks: 6.198883e-06s (10.879%)\r\n  Total compile time: 3.642474e+00s\r\n    Theano Optimizer time: 7.326508e-02s\r\n       Theano validate time: 3.712177e-04s\r\n    Theano Linker time (includes C, CUDA code generation/compiling): 9.584920e-01s\r\n\r\nClass\r\n---\r\n<% time> <sum %> <apply time> <time per call> <type> <#call> <#apply> <Class name>\r\n  100.0%   100.0%       0.000s       2.07e-06s     C        3        3   <class 'theano.tensor.elemwise.Elemwise'>\r\n   ...

For K workers, you will only need log K bits per coordinate when broadcasting the weights  (come and ask why in person if this is not straightforward. I'm sitting near Mu).  Because you are sending only the differences to the workers. I thought Chao did that before passing over the project to you.

You need to change the bitmasks in the struct quantize_signum and dequantize_signum, and also change the start and end indices to cover 32 values in one call. \r\nYou could use masks like 0x80, 0x40, 0x20, 0x10, 0x08, 0x04, 0x02, 0x01 for the values which are greater than 0. As an optimization don't encode negative values, and remove the second if statement in quantize. Let them be 0. During dequantization change them to -1. \r\n\r\nYes you'll not lose accuracy if the server forwards the differences to worker. But the way mxnet kvstore currently works is that it pushes the full model to the workers. As against this, if we tried to send differences then we would need to send (num_workers * compressed_size) data as updates to each worker. This is because we can't merge the updates from different workers without decompressing, merging and then compressing them back. Also if we do this, then if num_workers becomes higher than the compression factor, then gradient compression would give no speedup.

Seems it will create many omp threads before executing graph. How does this function affect the performance of mxnet? If I have set cpu affinity in my environment, these omp threads will be binded to each core. Then when executing computation graph, many other omp threads will be created and binded again. Do you think that will impact the performance?\"_\r\n\r\n@cjolivier01:\r\n\r\nSo yes, the graph executor itself will be a couple of threads that execute the operators which tend to, in turn, fork into many OMP threads for some parts of the operation (in some cases).  Operator tuning actually supresses this for some cases where the overhead of forking and converging the OMP threads takes longer than it would have taken to just do the whole operation on a single core.  This is much more pronounced on non-Intel-OMP libraries (ie libgomp).\r\n\r\nBut anyway, your question is about does the execution thread binded to a core cause the binded OMP thread to be slower due to caching concerns?  I'd answer \"maybe, but without data to the contrary, I assume that since the execution thread tends to be stalled while the operator is running its omp threads, that it's worse to reserve a whole core that will be idle while N-1 OMP threads run\".\r\n\r\n^^ this assumes multiple operators are not running in parallel, which is a whole other discussion as it relates to core binding.\r\n\r\nI am by no means steadfast in this opinion, but it is an assumption at this point.  Have you known this to be the case with other frameworks or experiments?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/360680487/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/360680765","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/9545#issuecomment-360680765","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9545","id":360680765,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MDY4MDc2NQ==","user":{"login":"pengzhao-intel","id":22461308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDYxMzA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22461308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pengzhao-intel","html_url":"https://github.com/pengzhao-intel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pengzhao-intel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pengzhao-intel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pengzhao-intel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pengzhao-intel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pengzhao-intel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pengzhao-intel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pengzhao-intel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pengzhao-intel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pengzhao-intel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-26T04:22:17Z","updated_at":"2018-01-26T04:26:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@cjolivier01 yes, looks good :)\r\nOne minor suggestion is to show the different instance of the Class/OP because their performance will be very different.

on feedback, I simplified the selector to reflect the current arrangement and ordering of the 22 Gluon/MXNet (v1.0) tutorials. \r\n\r\nOne of these v1.0 tutorials is commented out because it is broken (#9532).\r\n\r\nNow we do not have topical categories. The seven topics such as human language and image recognition are commented out for now. We can return to discussing their placement, the tutorials within, ordering, etc in the next release.\r\n\r\nI retained the addition of the 13 tutorials for C++, Scala, and R. \r\n\r\nMy first draft had 46 Python tutorials arrange into topics, but since we need alignment on what to add I've reduced this to 33 tutorials by removing any Gluon tutorials from The Straight Dope that were not in v1.0.\r\n\r\nOverall this still gives us an increase of over 20 tutorials that were fixed during the usability sprint. Most of these are now in the \"Applications\" grouping. They are alphabetized. \r\n\r\nNote: It isn't possible to use category headings in markdown to break these apart, since they'll always appear. This is from the selector code problems... which is why I had forced tutorials into categories that we generally related and not exactly, technically a perfect match.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/360927660/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/360928440","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/9580#issuecomment-360928440","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9580","id":360928440,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MDkyODQ0MA==","user":{"login":"zhanghang1989","id":8041160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNDExNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8041160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghang1989","html_url":"https://github.com/zhanghang1989","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghang1989/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghang1989/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghang1989/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghang1989/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghang1989/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghang1989/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghang1989/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghang1989/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghang1989/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-26T23:00:00Z","updated_at":"2018-01-26T23:00:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Solved.
