The data set I use to train the model is the same as used in this paper, and I just want to reproduce this experiment result see whether it really work. I think it is not overfitting cause the training loss and validations loss are both high. I think it's still underfitting. Can you just read this paper to check if my model structure is correct? Cause it is not too complicated and won't take you too much time. maybe about ten minutes at most.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13534043/33006930-47302874-ce07-11e7-95a0-f63d539f30b9.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13534043/33006123-19511100-ce04-11e7-9867-7e856d59255c.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/345611895/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/345613723","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/8720#issuecomment-345613723","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/8720","id":345613723,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NTYxMzcyMw==","user":{"login":"liuzhi136","id":13534043,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTM0MDQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13534043?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzhi136","html_url":"https://github.com/liuzhi136","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzhi136/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzhi136/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzhi136/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzhi136/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzhi136/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzhi136/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzhi136/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzhi136/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzhi136/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-20T07:35:51Z","updated_at":"2017-11-20T07:35:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I still wander whether the way I pad end character is correct ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/345613723/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/345615703","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/8720#issuecomment-345615703","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/8720","id":345615703,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NTYxNTcwMw==","user":{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-20T07:46:58Z","updated_at":"2017-11-20T07:46:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I'm asking you to try and overfit a small dataset first as sanity check.
