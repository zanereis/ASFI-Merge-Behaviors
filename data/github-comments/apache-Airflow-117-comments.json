That is why we are using timezone aware columns.\r\n\r\nChanging this potentially causes exactly the problem you are trying to avoid: suppose I am in -7:00 timezone and my server is set to UTC; now I create a new timezone aware datetime at 15:00-7:00 but I calculate now using utcnow, what ends up being created is 24:00-7:00, which gets stored as 7:00UTC the next day.\r\n\r\nIf columns are timezone aware, feed them timezone aware, then the columns and datetime objects will take care of all of this for you.\r\n\r\nThis is NOT a bug; this is working as intended.\r\n\r\nReasonably, one might want to use `server_default=func.now()` so that the server does the calculations and we don't worry about network latency but that's a different

The transition is handled by Airflow, all dates should be stored in UTC regardless of what time zone database server thinks it is in. Note that for many databases the current time zone is dependent on the connection (MySQL) or connection and server setting (Postgres) or no support at all (SQLite). In addition none of these databases are really time zone aware as they don’t store the time zone itself (only Oracle does afaik). This means that transitions are not handled correctly if left to the database.\r\n\r\nThis means that func.now created an arbitrary date that we cannot rely on across workers/scheduler and it circumvented the check we do to only store UTC date times as it was executed at the database level. \r\n\r\nDAGS store the information on time zones and with pendulum (and not pytz) we manage transitions across time zones and dst.\r\n\r\nYou could argue that converting the D.B. fields to time zone aware fields was redundant, however I think it is an improvement across the board.\r\n\r\nSo the mantra is:\r\n\r\n1. Everything in the database is required to be UTC\r\n2. Airflow uses UTC internally\r\n3. DAGs maintain time zone information\r\n4. Only at next/previous schedule for Cron schedules we convert back the DAG time zone.\r\n5. User interface (web) can therefore function time zone independent (not implemented)\r\n\r\nThis keeps things sane and is according to best practices.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/353574816/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/353578833","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2900#issuecomment-353578833","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2900","id":353578833,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MzU3ODgzMw==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-22T11:21:52Z","updated_at":"2018-01-04T08:47:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#
