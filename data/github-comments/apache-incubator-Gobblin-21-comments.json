Wich is wanted behaviour i guess. IMO the gain of the whole looping thing in Task,processRecord() is very little, it just shifts the place where they see nor record for long time from the position between n to n+1 to n-1 to n. This only has an impact when its the last record. In this case the fast forks will still be done faster then the problematic fork that caused the blocking.

First, since there is no rollback script if the upgrade fails in the database is an invalid state. Second, on an existing database the upgrade could take large amount of time which would delay the startup of gobblin. Third, many companies strictly control their databases and want to be in charge of when they are upgraded. This would not be possible if we automatically upgraded.\n\n I would much prefer if the code was backwards compatible with older versions of the database. That way upgrades could happen whenever and new features wouldn't be exposed until the upgrade had been applied. This is outside the scope of the pull request,  which was scoped to improving the performance of the job history database and ensuring the upgrades could be done. \n\nAlternatively I wouldn't be opposed to having a configurable option to automatically upgrade the
