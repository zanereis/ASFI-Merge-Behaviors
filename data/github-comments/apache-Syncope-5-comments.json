@DmitriyBrashevets please apply similar changes to `GroupDataBinderImpl` and `AnyObjectDataBinderImpl`\r\n\r\nFor groups the provisioning works well when the realm is changed.\r\n\r\nIf the org.apache.syncope.core.provisioning.java.data.AbstractAnyDataBinder#setRealm is executed after the before-projection is created then `org.apache.syncope.core.provisioning.java.data.AbstractAnyDataBinder#propByRes` calculates resources correctly as there may be changes in the `org.apache.syncope.common.lib.to.AttrTO` with schema \"__NAME__\" because of connObjectLink.\r\nThis leads to a consistent behavior for UserDataBinder and GroupDataBinder.\r\n\r\nSo, I'd say that moving of the execution of `org.apache.syncope.core.provisioning.java.data.AbstractAnyDataBinder#setRealm` below the creation of projections solves the issue.
