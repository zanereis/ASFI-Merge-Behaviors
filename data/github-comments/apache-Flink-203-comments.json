This worked so far for the network buffers when memory as a whole was set to off-/on-heap and the flink-reserved memory was not completely used. Now, however, if set to on-heap, the `-XX:MaxDirectMemorySize` is too sharp. I'm unsure about the solutions:\r\n1) remove setting `-XX:MaxDirectMemorySize` and let the JVM adjust automatically, or\r\n2) add some \"sane\" default to our off-heap usage?\r\n\r\nThe same may apply to Mesos if `ResourceProfile(cpuCores, heapMemoryInMB, directMemoryInMB, nativeMemoryInMB)` is used.

That would mean that Kafka doesn't support transactional parallel writes from two different process, which would be very strange. Could you point to a source of this information?\r\n\r\nIt does not prohibit parallel transactions. Just restricts what an EOS consumer, which reads only the committed messages can see.\r\n\r\nSee 'Reading Transactional Messages' section in JavaDoc for KafkaConsumer : https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/0.11.0/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/consumer/KafkaConsumer.java#L421 : \r\n\r\n> In read_committed mode, the consumer will read only those transactional messages which have been successfully committed. It will continue to read non-transactional messages as before. There is no client-side buffering in read_committed mode. Instead, the end offset of a partition for a read_committed consumer would be the offset of the first message in the partition belonging to an open transaction. This offset is known as the 'Last Stable Offset'(LSO).\r\n\r\nIf there is an open transaction, the EOS consumers don't read past it.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/321406973/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/321433194","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4500#issuecomment-321433194","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4500","id":321433194,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMTQzMzE5NA==","user":{"login":"FangYongs","id":28703471,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NzAzNDcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28703471?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FangYongs","html_url":"https://github.com/FangYongs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FangYongs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FangYongs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FangYongs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FangYongs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FangYongs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FangYongs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FangYongs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FangYongs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FangYongs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-10T02:29:28Z","updated_at":"2017-08-10T02:29:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@zentol I have created this PR to fix [https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-6787](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-6787), could you please have a look when you're free, thanks :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/321433194/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/321440303","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4188#issuecomment-321440303","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4188","id":321440303,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMTQ0MDMwMw==","user":{"login":"dbrinegar","id":1753336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTMzMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1753336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbrinegar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbrinegar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbrinegar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbrinegar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbrinegar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbrinegar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbrinegar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbrinegar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbrinegar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbrinegar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbrinegar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-10T03:24:20Z","updated_at":"2017-08-10T03:24:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Totally understand!

In that time we can not use the same `transactional.id` for new transactions. \r\n\r\nWe can walk around this issue by implementing a pool of `transactional.id`s, which we can save on the state.
