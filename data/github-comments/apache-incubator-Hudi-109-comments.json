Hudi does allow you to keep history of changes to the table, upto a certain time in the past (configured via cleaner settings). If we never cleaned the table, then all changes from time 0 to now, will be available. I need to think through what exactly the problems would be if we did that. I can think of the file listing time grow over time, but then with 0.7.0+ we have the metadata table to alleviate that. Also if these dimension tables are typically much smaller, it may not be an issue per se. \r\n\r\nThe bones are there for this to work. we will have to spend sometime to fully declare a table table can store infinite amount of changes without every cleaning (i.e get rid of) older versions.

\r\n- If there are more than 2 records, we apply the same logic right? \r\n\r\nSo, initial proposal was to change the signature of preCombine to take in schema. but feedback was given to try out serializable version so that we don't need to change the api and incur perf impact. \r\n\r\n@Karl-WangSK : feel free to clarify my questions and give us the latest update on this PR. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/789807546/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/789832019","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/2106#issuecomment-789832019","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/2106","id":789832019,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4OTgzMjAxOQ==","user":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-03T16:14:14Z","updated_at":"2021-03-03T16:14:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"fyi: we have another [PR](https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/1929) open to support similar feature for combineAndUpdate ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/789832019/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/789832412","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/1929#issuecomment-789832412","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1929","id":789832412,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4OTgzMjQxMg==","user":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-03T16:14:44Z","updated_at":"2021-03-03T16:14:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"FYI: we have another [PR](https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/2106) open to support similar feature just for preCombine.
