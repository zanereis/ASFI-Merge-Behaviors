Hopefully we can expose more performance problem areas and address them much like this ticket.\n\nVOTE +1.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/157084517/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/157085990","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/144#issuecomment-157085990","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/144","id":157085990,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NzA4NTk5MA==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-16T16:20:07Z","updated_at":"2015-11-16T16:20:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"do we keep this ticket open even after merging this PR?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/157085990/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/157090801","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/144#issuecomment-157090801","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/144","id":157090801,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NzA5MDgwMQ==","user":{"login":"twilmes","id":4722637,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MjI2Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4722637?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twilmes","html_url":"https://github.com/twilmes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twilmes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twilmes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twilmes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twilmes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twilmes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twilmes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twilmes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twilmes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twilmes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-16T16:36:44Z","updated_at":"2015-11-16T16:36:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"One thought I had was to create a new discovery type ticket to go in and do a more thorough analysis across a wider range of traversal uses to pull out other areas we can make similar improvements that will decrease traversal execution overhead.

Is that a problem or am I not thinking of that right?\n\nactually, I'm trying to think of what weird things might happen if there is something long running in the executor and then we call closeAsync()? If there was such a situation, that will schedule a job to close the transport which might somehow be in use by that long run job.  It seems like it is wrong to try to use the executor in shutdown.

not a problem - i figured your IDE was the culprit.  if you'd like to amend your PR with the fix to the imports that will be fine.  \n\nThe other thing we tend to do is mark all variables `final` (unless they are not - which really makes them jump out at you and makes you wonder why they are not when you see them in the code base). so for example you added:\n\n``` text\n    public static Io.Builder createIoBuilder(String graphFormat) throws ClassNotFoundException, IllegalAccessException, InstantiationException {\n        Class<Io.Builder> ioBuilderClass = (Class<Io.Builder>) Class.forName(graphFormat);\n        Io.Builder ioBuilder = ioBuilderClass.newInstance();\n        return ioBuilder;\n    }\n```\n\n`graphFormat`, `ioBuilder` and `ioBuilderClass` should be `final`.  `IoCore` is also a \"public\" API class, so some javadoc on that method would be good.  \n\nAnd last but not least, if you want to really tie a bow on this, you would add an entry to the CHANGELOG for 3.1.1:\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-tinkerpop/blob/master/CHANGELOG.asciidoc#tinkerpop-311-not-officially-released-yet\n\nPlease comment when you've updated the PR with those little changes and i'll merge after that.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/158584247/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/158643120","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/151#issuecomment-158643120","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/151","id":158643120,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1ODY0MzEyMA==","user":{"login":"dkuppitz","id":572377,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjM3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/572377?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz","html_url":"https://github.com/dkuppitz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-21T13:58:12Z","updated_at":"2015-11-21T13:58:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Worked

I guess that opens up the opportunity for there to be some inconsistency in the exceptions as one provider might choose to include cause and the other might not have a cause in the first place to throw....that might not matter i suppose.\n\nI also wonder if all exceptions should have this option.  It's a bigger change, but perhaps all exception methods should be deprecated and instead return some sort of `ExceptionBuilder<T extends Throwable>`.  That way, the provider could do something like:\n\n``` text\nthrow Property.Exceptions.buildDataTypeOfPropertyValueNotSupported(value).cause(root).create();\n```\n\nor \n\n``` text\nthrow Property.Exceptions.buildDataTypeOfPropertyValueNotSupported(value).create();\n```\n\nas the need was required.  Then this would be consistently applied.  Of course, perhaps this specific issue is isolated as a problem and we aren't hiding \"native\" causes and messages elsewhere.  If that's the case, then this pull request is the \"simple\" thing to do.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/158979326/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/158980645","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/141#issuecomment-158980645","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/141","id":158980645,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1ODk4MDY0NQ==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-23T16:05:18Z","updated_at":"2015-11-23T16:05:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@kushal256 i see you made some changes -

Consider the following sequence of operations in SparkGraphComputer when `null != System.getSecurityManager()`.\n- submit passes a task to CompletableFuture.supplyAsync (served by the forkjoin common pool)\n- submitted task calls FileSystem.get\n- FileSystem.get calls a bunch of Hadoop permission guts and eventually gets to UserGroupInformation.newLoginContext\n- UserGroupInformation.newLoginContext calls setContextClassLoader on the current thread\n- setContextClassLoader throws SecurityException if `null != System.getSecurityManager()` and the task is running in a common forkjoin pool thread, killing the task\n\nThe FileSystem.get call is visible in SGC's source.  The succeeding calls happen inside FileSystem.get and aren't visible in TP's source.  But GGC calls FileSystem.get with the same parameter signature as SGC, so they should both be affected by this problem.\n\nI don't know whether the same problem applies to TinkerGraphComputer, but my guess is no, unless TinkerGraphComputer's internals touch the context classloader or something else that does, like Hadoop.\n\nI'll rework the PR to apply to both SGC and GGC (but not TGC).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/159313974/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/159551463","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/156#issuecomment-159551463","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/156","id":159551463,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1OTU1MTQ2Mw==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-25T09:42:43Z","updated_at":"2015-11-25T09:42:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for this.
