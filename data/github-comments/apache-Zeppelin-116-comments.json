@tae-jun \r\n\r\nIt's good idea to introduce limitation when notes are in trash. Let me comment\r\n\r\n(1) What you mentioned is about restricting modification of archived notes (i mean, notes are in trash)\r\n(2) Removing `rename` and `clear output` **does not** mean disabling those functionality. It's just about hiding the menus. We can rename and clear output in the trashed notes. It's not about (1)\r\n\r\nSo I I think removing `rename` and `clear output` menu for archived notes can be handled in this PR.

Let me share the result in short. (and [created JIRA - ZEPPELIN 1850](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1850) for it)\r\n\r\n- (**IMPORTANT**) ~~It is impossible to handle in a single PR. It requires changing directory structure and this will causes sooooooo many rebase as other PR is merged. It would be painful if it is not merged quickly.~~\r\n- angular is more tricky to use webpack. (e.g how to handle ng-include? - [webpack-require-loader](https://github.com/shanhaichik/webpack-require-loader) )\r\n- we need to fix index.html. It includes all css, scripts instead of bundled one.\r\n- webpack configuration is not hard as expected.
