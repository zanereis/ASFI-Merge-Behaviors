Chris...\n\nThanks for looking at my PR.  Sorry about the unit test failure.  Ive addressed this and added another test case to cover checking delimiters that need regex escaping.\n\nTo make applying the patch simple, can you clarify what needs to be done here?   Are you suggesting I remove this PR, apply my changes on a fresh clone of the trunk and do a new pull request on that?   Or is there a set of steps I can do to resolve it in this PR?\n\nHere are the current plugin test results...\n\n```\n$ ant test-plugins....\n\ntest:\n     [echo] Testing plugin: creativecommons\n
