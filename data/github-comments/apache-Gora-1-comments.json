And yes this is a problem we have seen in other data stores as well. I mean managing complex data types because not all data stores provide the same functionality. For example, in gora-cassandra depending on your mapping file, you could create subcolumns inside a super column or even separated columns. Then when updating maps, you could end up updating a whole column even when a single value was modified inside an array or map. This behaviour is of course wrong. I guess this is also happening in accumulo per your test.\nI think there is a trade-off here between generating a column for each specific value of a map/array which leads to a more complex scan operation or using a single column to store them all which leads to the current behaviour.\nIn Cassandra, arrays and maps can be now stored natively, so I guess we will be using them soon instead of adding this extra \"mapping\" complexity.

Yes, it is recursive if there are nested objects, but the exception is for when \"something\" goes wrong with serialization (for example, class changes can easily make your serialized data unreadable if you were using reflection) that is why Java forces us to throw an IOException and not NullPointerException. And caching this exception makes us \"retry\" serialization calling again to <return toBytes(o)> on the object. If we don't print the IO exception, we would probably get an stackOverFlowException because of the recursion and catching this error would be a lot harder.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gora/issues/comments/136675372/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gora/issues/comments/137359947","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gora/pull/22#issuecomment-137359947","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gora/issues/22","id":137359947,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNzM1OTk0Nw==","user":{"login":"lewismc","id":1165719,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjU3MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1165719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc","html_url":"https://github.com/lewismc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-03T07:30:20Z","updated_at":"2015-09-03T07:30:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This
