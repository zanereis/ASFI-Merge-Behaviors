That was the case even in the pre-Apache days.\r\n\r\nI can tell you how it is meant to be:\r\n\r\nThe build result of the project we've just changed is a (quite small) `.dll` file. This lib is a helper library for the NBI Engine and thus gets physically embedded inside `nbi-engine.jar`. (if you open up a copy of `nbi-engine.jar` you'll find a path called `native/jnilib/windows/` where it lives). The `.dll` library is only used from Java code (it is JNI stuff) and is as such unrelated to `nlw.exe` which is simply the launcher for that Java code..\r\n\r\nAs I said my knowledge of the build process is near zero. What I wonder myself are:\r\n\r\n1. Have we actually triggered a new build of the `.dll`. If so, where did the build result go?\r\n2. How does the build result, the .dll file, get embedded into `nbi-engine.jar` ?. Do we need to trigger that build too?\r\n\r\nI believe that even in the pre-Apache days there were manual steps involved but that is just a hunch.\r\n\r\nIn the end the test of the change is simple:  Do an install of the IDE itself using installer (.exe) and when finished open `regedit.exe`. Have a look at the screenshot in [NETBEANS-2523](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NETBEANS-2523). The yellow highlight is what goes wrong. It should display the value \"1\" instead of displaying \"(invalid DWORD (32-bit) value)\".\r\n\r\nFor some time I've had my own version of NBI (all components) with this bug fixed. This is why I know it works.

If you use it today, in a week it could be obsolete. It is not like in Java, or in PHP. Just saying. I know that it is possible to change it, as you already said it, but it is not obvious to every user of NetBeans.
