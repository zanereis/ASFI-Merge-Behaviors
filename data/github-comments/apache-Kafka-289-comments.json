@ijuma This is particularly sensitive code since it's used everywhere so I'm doing at least one full round of tests here: https://jenkins.confluent.io/job/system-test-kafka-branch-builder/941\r\n\r\nI found this because of a timeout in an external test, but realized we could refine the last patch that added the `nc` check.\r\n\r\nThere is a slight change in behavior in this version because we only wait for JMX not the first message, where the first message would normally indicate a message had been consumed and therefore also indicates assignment must have happened. I'm honestly not sure if we have tests that depend on that behavior (unless there's some other output that may happen too, but I think we split out stdout, stderr, and log for just that reason). I am wondering if we should just put a `wait_until` on `has_partitions_assigned` after the JMX setup when it's the new consumer just to make use of the class simpler.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/311510267/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/311510627","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/3445#issuecomment-311510627","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/3445","id":311510627,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMTUxMDYyNw==","user":{"login":"asfgit","id":1341245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDEyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1341245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit","html_url":"https://github.com/asfgit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-27T23:06:22Z","updated_at":"2017-06-27T23:06:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer
