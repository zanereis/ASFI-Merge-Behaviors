all feedback or asked for more details (also poked you in slack)\r\n\r\nyou have 2 similar / related feedbacks, so trying to address here (GH isn't letting me reply...)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/3486#pullrequestreview-2263041945 - I tested out a `CommandsBuilder` and it made the test `RouteIndextTest` in cep-15-accord easier to read, but I don't see how it helps in this case due to 2 variables that I am not sure how to handle (without making the builder specific to this class)\r\n\r\n```\r\nfinal List<Runnable> preActions = new CopyOnWriteArrayList<>();\r\nfinal List<Runnable> onError = new CopyOnWriteArrayList<>();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `State` has a `preActions` and `onError` actions... these kinda distort the model and are plugged into the `Commands` functions... if I move to a `CommandsBuilder` model I think `onError` doesn't really change much, but `preActions` gets funky.  Personally I feel the `preActions` is a hack... it would be great to return `Command` so the history does reflect those steps... but that would kinda require each `Command` returned to be a `MultiCommand`... and what about actions that don't mutate anything and just update the `State`'s bookkeeping?  those don't change the history and would just clutter up the error message...\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/3486#discussion_r1732701880\r\n\r\nI don't see how a builder works in this specific case.  We are creating a single `Command` and this command has 3 behaviors: if topology changed do read, 20% of the time do reads, 80% of the time do writes.... the builder would need to handle the `if topology changed` bit... which seems funky... and doing a builder for the 20%/80% case seems more verbose than the current logic","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/comments/2313302319/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/comments/2313360928","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/3486#issuecomment-2313360928","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/3486","id":2313360928,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmWM6J4xYg","user":{"login":"dcapwell","id":1852601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTI2MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1852601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcapwell","html_url":"https://github.com/dcapwell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcapwell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcapwell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcapwell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcapwell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcapwell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcapwell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcapwell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcapwell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcapwell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-27T19:36:15Z","updated_at":"2024-08-27T19:36:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"ok

is also prerequisite for CASSANDRA-19556 which is on guardrails itself. This is just the minimum we need to do in order to do that.

But, we should briefly consider what our roadmap is for safely migrating a replica from stale to safely not stale.\r\n\r\n_Ideally_ the operator would have an unmark stale operation that indicates the other replicas should stop cleaning up state until this replica has caught up (like this achieves), but equally we might like the replica to continue to be marked stale in some way until we know that's happened (e.g. a round of durability scheduling has run successfully on the previously stale replica to confirm it is not stale, as otherwise e.g. a repair might need to be run by the operator).\r\n\r\nWhich raises a question: do we want more than one stale flags, e.g. one for whether a replica is to be included in durability scheduling, and another for whether the replica can be treated as healthy by other replicas for querying and by the operator for availability?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/comments/2316946511/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/comments/2317282438","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/3466#issuecomment-2317282438","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/3466","id":2317282438,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmWM6KHuyG","user":{"login":"smiklosovic","id":588603,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODYwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/588603?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smiklosovic","html_url":"https://github.com/smiklosovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smiklosovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smiklosovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smiklosovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smiklosovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smiklosovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smiklosovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smiklosovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smiklosovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smiklosovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-29T10:35:53Z","updated_at":"2024-08-29T10:35:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@frankgh maybe you could help with this one?

I think a comment could be updated, and in principle with the better knowledge afforded us by cluster metadata we might be able to avoid re-checking the electorate when the peer is known to have a stale view of the ring, but otherwise LGTM\r\n\r\nWe'll only actually re-check the electorate if the current epoch has moved on from the one in which the coordinator built the initial electorate. We could make that a bit more specific and check against the last modified epoch of the actual replica group for the token rather than the overall metadata epoch, but that's essentially equivalent to simply re-calculating it anyway.
