Summarizing our discussion here. We want to see if we can do the same for MergeHandle or not. Here are my initial thoughts on this.\r\nMerge Handle does 2 below operations\r\n\r\n- Read records from Spark and add it to \"keyToNewRecords\". There is no benefit in parallelizing this operation.\r\n- Read records from old parquet file and write it to new parquet file. I think there is some room here to optimize based on how much total time is spent in reading records from old parquet file vs total time spent in writing records to new parquet file. I will measure the timings and update it. If needed I will create another PR to handle MergeHandle use case.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/357061910/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/357155835","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/289#issuecomment-357155835","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/289","id":357155835,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NzE1NTgzNQ==","user":{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-12T06:39:33Z","updated_at":"2018-01-12T06:39:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"lets continue this review, after we work through the perf issues as well..
