Spring.  Notice that even Spring didn't dare to upgrade directly. We need to be careful with that.\r\n\r\n> As of Spring Framework 4.0, Java 8 is supported as a first-class citizen and we’ve seen some confusion in the Spring community since then. How do we manage to support Java 8 and remain compatible with Java 6 and Java 7 after all? \r\n\r\nSee https://spring.io/blog/2015/04/03/how-spring-achieves-compatibility-with-java-6-7-and-8 \r\n\r\nMy opinion is, if Saga needs JDK 8, the question is, in the compile stage or running stage. Even in the running stage. ShardingSphere could be compiled into two components, **ss-core**, and **ss-transaction**.\r\n\r\n**ss-core** could stay in JDK 7 for the longer term. **ss-transaction** moved into JDK 8, considering it is the new feature to everyone, right?\r\n\r\nOf course, this is only about Sharding-Sphere's JDBC lib part. Sharding-Sphere Proxy is free to upgrade.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/413795884/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/413797551","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/1157#issuecomment-413797551","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/1157","id":413797551,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMzc5NzU1MQ==","user":{"login":"jian365066744","id":35258103,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MjU4MTAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35258103?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jian365066744","html_url":"https://github.com/jian365066744","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jian365066744/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jian365066744/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jian365066744/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jian365066744/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jian365066744/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jian365066744/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jian365066744/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jian365066744/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jian365066744/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-17T08:36:13Z","updated_at":"2018-08-17T08:36:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/413797551/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/413797562","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/1157#issuecomment-413797562","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/1157","id":413797562,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMzc5NzU2Mg==","user":{"login":"wujun8","id":7053898,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNTM4OTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7053898?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wujun8","html_url":"https://github.com/wujun8","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wujun8/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wujun8/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wujun8/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wujun8/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wujun8/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wujun8/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wujun8/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wujun8/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wujun8/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-17T08:36:17Z","updated_at":"2018-08-17T08:36:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"-1\r\nUpgrading
