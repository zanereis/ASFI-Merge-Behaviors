@fdoumet \r\n\r\nFirst off, apologies for letting your issue get stale, we get quite a lot and sometimes we miss them, so thanks for chasing away the stale bot 😅. On the bright side, it made me notice this issue, and while I don't have access to an Azure environment to actually test this, I was able to do a bit of research and have an idea about how maybe we can improve the situation.\r\n\r\nLooking into the error message the issue report, specifically the \r\n\r\n```The specified block list is invalid.```\r\n\r\ni ran into this [stackoverflow discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12917857/the-specified-block-list-is-invalid-while-uploading-blobs-in-parallel), and these 2 issue reports for a .net library https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-net/issues/456 and https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-net/issues/780 seem to indicate that this error message can potentially happen when multiple writers try to write to the same blob, and a potential solution might be to perform a retry.\r\n\r\nThe good news is that the Azure storage pusher does have a retry mechanism, controlled by `druid.azure.maxTries` and it defaults to `3`, but in this case it looks like an `IOException` which was not internally considered as retry-able. However, the `StorageException` which is the cause of that `IOException` is considered eligible for retry,  so I've opened a PR, #8296, that adjusts the retry logic that the push implementation uses to now retry in the case of the error messages like you have reported.\r\n\r\nI don't know if this will actually fix this issue and unfortunately am unable to test, but with any luck maybe it will do the trick 🤞.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/521048760/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/521049419","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/8296#issuecomment-521049419","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8296","id":521049419,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMTA0OTQxOQ==","user":{"login":"dampcake","id":6202532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMDI1MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6202532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dampcake","html_url":"https://github.com/dampcake","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dampcake/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dampcake/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dampcake/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dampcake/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dampcake/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dampcake/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dampcake/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dampcake/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dampcake/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-13T23:43:22Z","updated_at":"2019-08-13T23:43:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"👍","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/521049419/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/521072996","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/8025#issuecomment-521072996","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8025","id":521072996,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMTA3Mjk5Ng==","user":{"login":"JiajianQtl","id":16909734,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTA5NzM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16909734?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiajianQtl","html_url":"https://github.com/JiajianQtl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiajianQtl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiajianQtl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiajianQtl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiajianQtl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiajianQtl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiajianQtl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiajianQtl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiajianQtl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiajianQtl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-14T01:57:19Z","updated_at":"2019-08-14T01:57:19Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I met the same issue, have any solution?

I've managed to reproduce this issue internally but don't have a fix yet.\r\n@leventov Could you help in giving some pointers on how to debug this issue, since this seems to entirely based on the rewrite of the index merging code via #5335. The overall gist of the issue is that the combined values of theta sketches after index merging using the `RowPointer` approach is different from the combined values using Rowboats merging. This mismatch happens only in case of a fairly large input data file. For example, the testcase I have currently has close to 110,000 events with a single thetasketch metric. Querying the indices merged using the RowBoat technique gives me the sketch value to be 1756 and querying those merged using the RowPointer technique gives the value as 1746. This difference widens as there are bigger indices to be merged.\r\nI don't think this issue is related to sketch merge unpredictability since the sketch size and the data set are the same and this should return consistent results.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/521781933/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/521786344","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/8257#issuecomment-521786344","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8257","id":521786344,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMTc4NjM0NA==","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-15T20:30:43Z","updated_at":"2019-08-15T20:30:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you for the review.\r\n\r\n> currently, user needs to set `totalNumMergeTasks` which by default is set to a static value of 10. as a follow up, it would be great to change the default value dynamically based on size of data, number of partitions, number of segment intervals etc ... so that default behavior just works for most cases.\r\n\r\nYes, the number of merge tasks can be automatically computed in the future. `PartitionStat` was added to collect some statistics which could be useful for such computation.

Adding tests to catch these kinds of errors is not very productive, so using lombok to automatically generate methods like these is helpful. I also find lombok useful to generating getter/setters for DTOs, for similar reasons.\r\n\r\nThe lombok builder generator is very useful and will make the code more readable in places like this:\r\n```\r\n           new IndexTuningConfig(\r\n                null,\r\n                10000,\r\n                10,\r\n                null,\r\n                null,\r\n                null,\r\n                null,\r\n                null,\r\n                null,\r\n                indexSpec,\r\n                null,\r\n                3,\r\n                false,\r\n                null,\r\n                null,\r\n                null,\r\n                null,\r\n                null,\r\n                null,\r\n                null\r\n            )\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's also possible to easily [ignore the lombok-generated methods from code coverage](https://www.rainerhahnekamp.com/en/ignoring-lombok-code-in-jacoco/), making the code coverage reports more useful.\r\n\r\nSome possible drawbacks of using lombok:\r\n- Slower IDE performance (since it has to delombok the code to index it)\r\n- \"Missing\" code for IDEs/editors without lombok plugins (although most of the popular IDEs, like Eclipse and IntelliJ, do have support)\r\n- Debugging/callstacks do not match the source code\r\n\r\nOverall, I think the advantages of lombok outweigh its drawbacks.
