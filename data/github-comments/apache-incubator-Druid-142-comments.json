thanks for taking a look at this\r\n\r\non line 468 of KafkaIndexTask, the nextOffsets map is updated based on the currentOffset taken from the message itself so this should be accurate regardless if messages were skipped or not (the +1 being to read the next message, which might wind up not existing and it would skip ahead again)\r\n```\r\nnextOffsets.put(record.partition(), record.offset() + 1);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs for the equality check vs a greater than or equal, I was considering this and decided against it because with the current implementation, even with skipping offsets, getting an offset value greater than the endOffset would be considered a bug in the logic. The ending offset is set by the supervisor after the taskDuration elapses and is based on the latest offset any of the replicas made it to before they were paused, which means that this has to be a valid offset, so if one replica read a certain offset value and another one skipped that offset, that shouldn't be treated as correct

These two properties directly correlate to `port` and `tlsPort` on `DruidNode`. HTTP connector always uses `port` and HTTPS always uses `tlsPort`. If we want standard TLS ports then they can be the default port number + 100 or something like that.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/301925360/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/301925567","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/4270#issuecomment-301925567","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4270","id":301925567,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMTkyNTU2Nw==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-16T21:48:06Z","updated_at":"2017-05-16T21:49:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Both of those seem a bit magical to me.
