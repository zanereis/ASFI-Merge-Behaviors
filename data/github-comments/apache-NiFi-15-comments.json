I understand you want to share a common base class for the Kinesis processors, and use shared AWS code for credentials, property validation, etc.  I also see that AbstractProcessor's functionality is not particularly hard to replicate right now.  But that might change in the future, and most of the AWS processors would benefit from common functionality and compliance without benefiting from the customization.\n\nThese Kinesis processors seem more of an exception to the rule rather than an indicator of the common needs of AWS processors.  As you point out above, the Kinesis producer/consumer processors use a different set of AWS libraries, running an out-of-process native code module, and driven by different concurrency and flow control concerns.  I don't believe these requirements will be shared by any other AWS processors on the near horizon.\n\nI don't have any big concerns about your implementation of AbstractBaseAWSProcessor, it appears OK.  Our AWS processor class hierarchy is already in need of some repairs, and this could be made to fit.  But I'm not sure that should be done for this PR, driven by the Kinesis processors.\n\nA few other comments:\n- I recommend renaming the processors something like \"GetKinesisStream\" and \"PutKinesisStream\", to distinguish them from PutKinesisFirehose and possible future Kinesis processors for their analytics product.\n- We should document the AWS permission requirements, at least a link to the AWS docs on the permissions required by the KCL/KPL (Kinesis, DynamoDB, and CloudWatch?).\n- There does not appear to be a lot of unit test coverage of key onTrigger methods and flowfile processing.\n\nI am still working on running the integration tests and doing more detailed code review.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/221619193/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/221623264","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/420#issuecomment-221623264","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/420","id":221623264,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMTYyMzI2NA==","user":{"login":"julianhyde","id":1130553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzA1NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1130553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde","html_url":"https://github.com/julianhyde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-25T16:01:52Z","updated_at":"2016-05-25T16:01:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@joewitt I agree with your philosophy... however sometimes the other project didn't put as much thought into the decision as you imagine.

I can create separate KPL/KCL based processors but then I will not able to reuse some of the properties, methods available in the Nifi's AWS base classes.  Also, there is are `AmazonWebServiceClient` based Kinesis consumer and producer just like for S3, SNS, SQS, etc but as you've also pointed out we loose the advantages of automatic recovery, batching, monitoring, load balancing across shards etc provided by the KCL/KPL libraries. I also think (this is just MHO), that maybe other event driven services (SQS,SNS, etc) can benefit from the KCL/KPL model. Let me know if using the re-implementing KCL/KPL based processors independent of the current processor (ie, without changing the base classes) is a better choice.\n\nI can change the names, document permissions required for dynamodb, cloudwatch, etc, and add more unit tests as you've recommended.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any other suggestions.\n\nThanks again for your comments/advice.\n\nMans\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/222020291/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/222057686","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/239#issuecomment-222057686","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/239","id":222057686,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMjA1NzY4Ng==","user":{"login":"jvwing","id":3151078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTEwNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3151078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing","html_url":"https://github.com/jvwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-27T04:29:18Z","updated_at":"2016-05-27T04:29:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Your suggestion about the plain old SDK Kinesis API is interesting, but I guess I don't recommend it.  Using the plain SDK would let NiFi handle the multithreading, retries, batching, etc.  It would be a win for the NiFi model.  But then we would also have to pick up at least some of the KCL's other features, like balancing traffic across shards, or leave that as an excercise for the user.  It sounds complicated and hard, and I'm lazy.  Also, the KCL is recommended by Amazon, as you pointed out earlier, and not using it might be a point of confusion as to why we didn't do it the \"right\" way, especially if a new version of the KCL is released with features we hadn't thought of.  So even though the KCL is an awkward fit in NiFi, as long as it is an opt-in feature, it seems like a good addition to NiFi's AWS interoperability story.\n\nPart of why I would prefer to not change the base AWS processor classes is to keep it opt-in.  I'm not sure how the other AWS Get\\* processors would benefit from the Kinesis-like threading model, they do not have applications or threads to drive activity outside of NiFi's scheduling.  But I can see lobbying for a change to `AbstractProcessor` to remove `onTrigger`'s `final` modifier for cases like these without divorcing the class hierarchies.\n\nA recently merged [change in the 0.x branch](https://github.com/apache/nifi/commit/de7ecd719a2e9907042628ea3a8283cfe2d4fbac) for NIFI-786 has some shared credential property descriptors and validation logic that you may be able to use, that will hopefully make it easier to implement separate base classes.

Will fix the typos.\n\nThe Apache Commons Email API decodes them automatically (reason I used the API in the first place)\n\ne.g, \n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3108527/15710053/8fee0b20-284b-11e6-928c-df2912e393f3.png)\n\nclicking \"download\" will result in NiFi gracefully sending the logo.gif file, with the correct filename, ready for consumption. \n\nWould you prefer the child flowfiles to contain the blobs or to keep the data still in base64? \n\nI know we have the Base64Encode processor but I wonder if it is a good choice to keep the data in base64. I may be projecting my personal choice but I would imagine one of the main reasons people would decode an attachment is to do something with the decoded data itself?\n\nRegarding additional attributes, I agree and will have a look on what extra details may be valuable.\n\nI for example, noticed that parent flowfile UUID attribute isn't there, and this is something that IMHO would be particularly valuable for those looking to use NiFi as an interface between SMTP and an email archival database running on Mongo or ElasticSearch.\n\nRegarding timing information, I am considering if we shouldn't split ListenSMTP into ListenSMTP and ParseEmail.\n\nThis way DFM can decide between:\n1.

The first few I have are below:\n\nFirst in regards to the internal queue of messages, there needs to be some kind of limit on it. If a user doesn't set a fast enough trigger duration the queue could become enormous and, since all the messages are held in memory, potentially bringing NiFi to a halt. Here is the property I add to ConsumeMQTT[2].\n\nThis leads to the second, what to do with the internal queue when the processor is stopped. There will potentially be some data left in the internal queue when the processor is stopped and if that data is not handled it will more than likely be lost. In the OnStopped I actually transfer all messages in the queue (just like is done int he OnTrigger)[3].\n\nIn the PutAWSIoT processor, you read the attributes from the FlowFile to essentially overwrite Processor defined properties. Being able to have different QoS/Topics/Retained different messages is very important and the most user friendly way to do this is through Expression Language. Check out how I do it here[4].

I don't think the AppVeyor build is reliable, there don't appear to be any recent successful builds.\n\nFor GetKinesisStream exceptions, I think your approach of logging without creating a FlowFile is correct.  I'm not sure we could count on there being anything useful to put in a FlowFile other than the error message, such that the failed FlowFile can be meaningfully processed other than logging.  I did not find any other Get\\* processor with a failure route.\n\nHave you experienced errors at that stage of Kinesis client processing?  I don't have enough experience with Kinesis Streams to know what bad things are going to happen there, so I don't have clear failure scenarios to think through.  By checkpointing to the last successfully processed record, I believe the 'bad' record will be retried by the KCL.  This seems reasonable, but if NiFi continues to fail on the same record, won't we end up in an infinite retry loop?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/223107257/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/223123823","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/239#issuecomment-223123823","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/239","id":223123823,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMzEyMzgyMw==","user":{"login":"mans2singh","id":8467404,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0Njc0MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8467404?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh","html_url":"https://github.com/mans2singh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-01T21:02:56Z","updated_at":"2016-06-01T21:05:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @jvwing:  \n\nRegarding exception handling - Kinesis will automatically handle retrying if there is kinesis client error from the last checkpoint created in the GetKinesisStream.  \n\nIn case of exceptions while handling a record inside the GetKinesisStream (line 220)\n\n{code:GetKinesisStream.java}\ncatch (Exception e) {\n           if ( flowFile != null ) {\n                session.remove(flowFile);\n            }\n            getLogger().error(\"Error while handling record: \" + e.getMessage());\n } \n{code}\n\nI was thinking instead of just removing the FlowFile, I should pass the flowFile to failure relationship, and include it among the checkpoint record so that user can handle it separately and we will continue processing all the record being passed to the GetKinesisStream handler and won't get into a loop with a bad record.\n\nLet me know what you recommend.\n\nThanks\n\nMans\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/223123823/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/223139346","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/239#issuecomment-223139346","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/239","id":223139346,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMzEzOTM0Ng==","user":{"login":"jvwing","id":3151078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTEwNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3151078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing","html_url":"https://github.com/jvwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-01T22:05:35Z","updated_at":"2016-06-01T22:05:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Checkpointing after catching an exception would keep things moving, I can see the benefit there.
