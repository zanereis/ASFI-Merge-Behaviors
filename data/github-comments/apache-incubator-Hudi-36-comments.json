If `HIVE_ASSUME_DATE_PARTITION_OPT_KEY` is set `true`, the fsutil can only match `basePath + /*/*/*`, but the partition is `basePath + /yyyy-MM-dd` actually. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20113411/70967797-5cc72f00-20d2-11ea-8004-6d910879d1ac.png)\r\n\r\n### Two ways to solve this problem\r\n1, Set `HIVE_ASSUME_DATE_PARTITION_OPT_KEY` to `false`. After that, HoodieHiveClient will get all folder partitions, for detail, you can visit `FSUtils#getAllPartitionPaths`.\r\n\r\n2, If user custom the partition extractor, HiveSyncTool sync no partition at the first commit, we can get the partiton info from `HoodieTimeline`, just like the code I modified.\r\n\r\nIMO, the second solution can guarantee that whether `HIVE_ASSUME_DATE_PARTITION_OPT_KEY` is true or not, we can sync acpartition at first time.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/566390544/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/566403318","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/1091#issuecomment-566403318","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1091","id":566403318,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NjQwMzMxOA==","user":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-17T06:35:39Z","updated_at":"2019-12-17T06:35:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vinothchandar : have addressed all feedback so far. waiting for few clarifications from you.

BufferedFSInputStream allows seek forward (file pointer to make forward progress) and limited seek backwards functionality (seek to a previously set mark on the stream).
