I had realized this was not the correct procedure so had already started to create separate branches on my fork for the other PR's.  Apologies for the scare here with the \"Merge\" label.\n\nAFA this particular PR. I did work through the original (prior to my PR) logic with a coworker. yes it is actually correct. It is also complicated.  Now I am not attempting at this point to resurrect my PR. But I will still maintain that it is better code.\n\na) Shorter, more concise and yes better performing - though as Josh points out correctly there is actually no long running code that is being locked in the original code : so the benefits in this case are insubstantial.\n\nb) AFA the - correct - protest about the use of interning numbers - which could be re-used in other parts of the code. I agree. But  a small fix takes care of it. Simply prepend the interned ShuffleId with the className:objectName and now it is unique.  e.g.  s\"o.a.s.MapOutputTracker.shuffleID$shuffleId\".  That would then not collide with potentially other usages of this tactic.\n\nI will actually look at the half dozen other cases that use the present Set checking tactic at some point. But we are all a bit tired of this topic right now - and 1.1.0 is in any case \"a wrap\".  So this particular PR can safely remain closed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50814023/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50814109","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1698#issuecomment-50814109","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1698","id":50814109,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwODE0MTA5","user":{"login":"mengxr","id":829644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyOTY0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/829644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr","html_url":"https://github.com/mengxr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-31T20:30:16Z","updated_at":"2014-07-31T20:30:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@andy327

@pwendell Are you suggesting something like this:\n\n```\nif no \"--\" exists in CLI arguments\n  treat all those options after primary resource as application options\nelse:\n  split them at \"--\"\n  take those before \"--\" as spark-submit options\n  take those after \"--\" as application options\n```\n\nThis logic accepts the following invocation happily:\n\n```\nbin/spark-submit --class Foo user.jar --arg1\n```\n\nBut we still need to rewrite the following one (which is mostly used in those scripts that delegates to `spark-submit`)\n\n```\nbin/spark-submit --class Foo user.jar --master local --arg1\n```\n\ninto\n\n```\nbin/spark-submit --class Foo user.jar --master local -- --arg1\n```\n\nTake `sbin/start-thriftserver.sh` as an example, the core lines of this script is:\n\n``` bash\nCLASS=org.apache.spark.sql.hive.thriftserver.HiveThriftServer2\nexec \"FWDIR\"/bin/spark-submit --class $CLASS spark-internal \"$@\"\n```\n\nNote that `$@` may contain both `spark-submit` options as well as application options by design. Consider the following two invocation:\n\n``` bash\n# Case A\n./sbin/start-thriftserver.sh --hiveconf hive.root.logger=DEBUG,console\n# Case B\n./sbin/start-thriftserver.sh --master local -- --hiveconf hive.root.logger=DEBUG,console\n```\n\nCase A is compatible with the current documented design, while case B still require the _user_ to add `--` after `--master local`. Although a little better, this is still an incompatible change (you can't just pass `--master local --hiveconf ...` as what we can do now).\n\n(And I haven't updated the documentation yet, will do that after we come to a final conclusion).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50829383/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50829596","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1661#issuecomment-50829596","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1661","id":50829596,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwODI5NTk2","user":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-31T22:55:53Z","updated_at":"2014-07-31T22:55:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@marmbrus Since #1686 can be a cleaner solution for this issue, let's wait a little bit before merging this one.

no, I'm suggesting keeping the current behavior, which is defined in SparkSubmitArguments.scala around line 310, starting with this:\n\n```\ncase value :: tail =>\n  if (inSparkOpts) {\n```\n\nWhat that code does is, as soon as an unrecognized option is found, it considers everything else as app options. That means that it doesn't matter where in the command line the \"primary resource\" is.\n\nExamples:\n\n```\nspark-submit /my.jar --master foo --unknown-option 10\n```\n\n`--unknown-option 10` becomes argument to main class.\n\n```\nspark-submit --master foo /my.jar --unknown-option 10\n```\n\nSame thing. The issue you point out, and that's true, is that if `--unknown-option` is added as a SparkSubmit option, it won't be passed to the app anymore. In that case, and that case alone, the command line must be re-written as either of:\n\n```\nspark-submit /my.jar --master foo -- --unknown-option 10\nspark-submit --master foo /my.jar -- --unknown-option 10\n```\n\nNote that it doesn't require anyone except the user who wants his application to still get `--unknown-option` as an argument to do anything.\n\nBasically, don't change any of the existing code; just add a case that handles \"--\" to stop parsing SparkSubmit options. That should be very, very simple to do. Could be as simple as adding:\n\n```\ncase \"--\" :: tail =>\n  childArgs = tail\n```\n\n(Although that's obviously completely untested.)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50831029/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50831248","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1697#issuecomment-50831248","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1697","id":50831248,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwODMxMjQ4","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-31T23:17:35Z","updated_at":"2014-07-31T23:17:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I have some concern (maybe unfounded) about runtime.

, sorry for the confusing. From the architecture point of view (see http://www.slideshare.net/Hadoop_Summit/spark-and-shark page 22 & page 23), `CLI` and `JDBC Service` have lots of common functions which is done within the `Driver`. So, I think it's better to fix the #1661 in `Driver` rather than in `CLI`, currently it doesn't matter, but we need to test if JDBCService has the same bug.
