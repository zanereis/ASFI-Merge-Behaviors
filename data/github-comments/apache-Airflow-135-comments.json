Makes some changes to allow the k8s executor to run outside of a kubernetes cluster. This will be really good for future development, but also just makes sense since the executor itself isn't exactly k8s dependent\r\n2. Creates a \"kube_run\" command with unit tests. This command looks a lot like \"test\", except it records the state once the task is finished. Please let me know if there is a different way you would like me to handle this.\r\n3. Allows users to specify if their airflow home is different on the workers than on the leader (which would often be the case for local development).\r\n\r\nLemme know what you think and I'll be sure to do some more for this tomorrow!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/385313565/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/385323918","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2784#issuecomment-385323918","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2784","id":385323918,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NTMyMzkxOA==","user":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-30T06:53:02Z","updated_at":"2018-04-30T06:53:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Done

The `kube_run` function wouldn't just be used for the tests but would also be used in the production k8s run. The idea is that there's no real reason to have a running scheduler on the workers since if the task dies the watcher would pick up the failure and report it back. Another option would be to add a `--kubernetes-mode` to the run function. But I found that having a second scheduler running on the workers just added a lot of extra logging and complexity/made it hard to debug why the tasks were reporting failures.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/385457746/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/385460425","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2847#issuecomment-385460425","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2847","id":385460425,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NTQ2MDQyNQ==","user":{"login":"moe-nadal-ck","id":28959205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTU5MjA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28959205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck","html_url":"https://github.com/moe-nadal-ck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-30T16:56:44Z","updated_at":"2018-04-30T16:56:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@r39132 Done!
