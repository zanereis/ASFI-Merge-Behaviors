Either way, I'm still concerned about potentially relaxing an integrity constraint without sufficient justification, even if it is slightly easier.\r\n\r\nYou've requested my opinion, and my opinion is that stores without this integrity check put users at greater risk and we shouldn't let users shoot themselves in the foot like that. I don't think this risk justifies whatever ease of use comes from avoiding setting a password to add an integrity check to the store (which can be done by running the simple command `keytool -storepasswd -keystore my.truststore`). Even if the risk is small, I think the ease of use benefit is smaller.\r\n\r\nI'm not convinced that you've made a case that this ease does justify the risks, but I'm willing to hear you out if you wish to make such a case. Otherwise, feel free to proceed with my objection outstanding. I won't veto or block it... I just think it's a bad idea.

Then we could have an API for listing active bulk imports that also gives this ID back OR we could modify the FATE print command to show this id.  I think this is an easier to use solution for user because it does not make them persist a tx id in a durable way.  In the new API, this could look like the following.\r\n\r\n```\r\nString bulkId = userApplicationName+\":\"+dir;\r\nconn.tableOperations().importDirectory(dir).to(aTable).withUserId(bulkId).load();\r\n```\r\n\r\nAn API for listing active bulk import may be nice, it could show the source dir, number of files, table, start time, fate tx id, user id, and number of outstanding tablets.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/422409536/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/422439275","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/636#issuecomment-422439275","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/636","id":422439275,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMjQzOTI3NQ==","user":{"login":"milleruntime","id":11872539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODcyNTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11872539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime","html_url":"https://github.com/milleruntime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-18T15:26:23Z","updated_at":"2018-09-18T15:26:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Why replace Connector with AccumuloClient?

I am not convinced the readme is better place for new devs to find this critical piece of information.  My thinking was that javadoc is something that developers read in their IDE, therefore its important we define the API there.  I had two goals for this javadoc that I thought new developers were likely to read:\r\n\r\n  * Define the public API\r\n  * Help new developers find other top level API entry points \r\n\r\n>  the README is also for consumers of the binary tarball... which does not contain the Accumulo.java file\r\n\r\nThats a good point.   Based on these comments I think the following would be a better solution than defining the API in Readme.md or Accumulo.java.\r\n\r\n  * Define the API on the website at a place where it has a stable link, like https://accumulo.apache.org/api.   \r\n  * Link to this definition from README.md, Accumulo.java, Accumulo Tour, Accumulo User manual, and any other docs written for developers.  \r\n\r\nI took a quick look at the tour and the user manual section on writing clients and did not see mention of the API.  We could make all of these places link to the README on github, but I think linking to https://accumulo.apache.org/api is more elegant.

I'm not sure I fully understand your question, but Accumulo manages lexicographical ordered arbitrary byte arrays. The APIs for String (or CharSequence) parameters are for convenience, and if a character encoding is not provided, it will assume UTF-8 (unless there's a bug that we've overlooked, and then it *may* assume whatever default encoding your local JVM is using).\r\n\r\nIf you need to scan/delete/insert something with non-printable (binary) characters, you should be able to provide the exact byte array, rather than use any String with a particular encoding.\r\n\r\nFor convenience, the shell attempts to identify characters which aren't printable and displays them in a hex-encoded format. However, it's not a perfect algorithm... it assumes non-printable, even if your console is capable of printing them, and it may be hard to distinguish between something like the bytes for the literal string `\\x00` (a literal backslash, followed by a literal 'x', followed by two literal '0' characters) and the encoded form of a null (0) byte `\\x00`. The shell has limitations like this, but you should be able to distinguish between these cases easily using the Java API directly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/426385456/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/426389330","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/645#issuecomment-426389330","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/645","id":426389330,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNjM4OTMzMA==","user":{"login":"alerman","id":119506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTUwNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/119506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alerman","html_url":"https://github.com/alerman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alerman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alerman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alerman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alerman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alerman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alerman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alerman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alerman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alerman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-02T18:51:38Z","updated_at":"2018-10-02T18:51:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ctubbsii

Ideally tablets would use the same dir name across volumes.   For example a tablet with two files could look like :  `<vol1>/tables/5/t-000000e/F0000002.rf` and `<vol2>/tables/5/t-000000e/F0000003.rf`.  Notice that `t-000000e` is used across volumes.\r\n * Need to remove directory column from metadata table on upgrade\r\n * Need to remove code using directory column or repurpose column to contain tablet dir name.\r\n * Code that cleans up unused tmp files on tablet load may not inspect all volumes.\r\n\r\nAddressing these issues would be involved.
