Your concerns about license mixing is relevant. And I absolutely agree that keep license clean is a priority.\r\n\r\nI've got your point about reverse linker->tvm dependency. And moreover It will be more elegant solution I guess. I will do it on iOS RPC server side via \"tvm.rpc.server.load_module\" rewriting. It will have the same effect. \r\n\r\nBut anyway, I didn't fully catch your position regarding keep this module in 3rdparty folder. Is it acceptable or not? My wishes is very simple, I would like to have TVM tuning with iOS devices out of box. Doesn't matter how it will be distributed: integrated submodule, checked out by cmake or installed from brew.  \r\n\r\nIf we would like to keep 3rdparty folder only for Apache/MIT/BSD licensed code, I can suggest next plan of integration:\r\n\r\n1. Move all changes into iOS RPC server app. New DSO loader injection via \"tvm.rpc.server.load_module\" modification.\r\n2. Implement minimal loader version from scratch and put it under ALv2 license near iOS_rpc app. Just a minimal quasi loader  suitable for tuning purposes. It will depend only on system header files from public SDK (like `mach-o/loader.h` and may be some others). I hope it's applicable to include files with Apple License header from apache code.\r\n\r\n@tqchen What do you think regarding this?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/833513287/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/833584917","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7875#issuecomment-833584917","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7875","id":833584917,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzMzU4NDkxNw==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-06T14:49:52Z","updated_at":"2021-05-06T14:53:11Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks @apeskov I agree moving the changes into the iOS rpc app.  The files we include in the 3rdparty would beed to be apache compatible, because we bundle and release the source code, which requires more careful handling. \r\n\r\nOnly putting macho loader that is ALv2, and provide instructions/script for the user of iOS RPC to download and link the macho loader is cleaner. Given that particular header's API is generic(can use dlopen on linux), we can also make the name generic(e.g. custom_dlopen),  we can release that particular header under Apache v2, and implement the API using the mach-o library. As the end result, from the source release point of view we are not bundling the source code with Apple license. \r\n\r\nOf course the user who wish to use iOS RPC app would need to build the app, and at that time the app itself need to comply with the Apple license. \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/833584917/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/833597271","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/7971#issuecomment-833597271","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7971","id":833597271,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzMzU5NzI3MQ==","user":{"login":"daniperfer","id":25509726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTA5NzI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25509726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniperfer","html_url":"https://github.com/daniperfer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniperfer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniperfer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniperfer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniperfer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniperfer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniperfer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniperfer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniperfer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniperfer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-06T15:05:48Z","updated_at":"2021-05-06T15:05:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I will reformulate the question in a new issue, since this one is already closed...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/833597271/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/833615631","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7970#issuecomment-833615631","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7970","id":833615631,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzMzYxNTYzMQ==","user":{"login":"leandron","id":437416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzQxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/437416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron","html_url":"https://github.com/leandron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-06T15:29:17Z","updated_at":"2021-05-06T15:29:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> cc @jroesch i think we should move all containers at once rather than just ci_gpu, though.\r\n\r\nSo I guess what you're suggesting is to update all the existing 16.04 images to 18.04?

However, we didn't add loaded records to `self.xs` and `self.ys`, so they won't perform as you expected.

apt-registry which is no longer valid. \r\n\r\nSecond there were some updates to the drivers which caused breakage, specifically this test no longer works because it incorrectly believes that CUDA is on (even though there is no GPU): \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/main/tests/cpp/build_module_test.cc#L84\r\n\r\nThese needs to be patched to actually check for the GPU's existence.
