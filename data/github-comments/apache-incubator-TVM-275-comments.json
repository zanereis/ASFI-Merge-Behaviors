Thanks. I think the only remaining issue is that `prj.conf` generation mechanism currently doesn't account for boards that don't have a FPU (like the `mps2_an521` board), so `CONFIG_FPY=y ` is set for every board. So I think we need to fix it because it's a regression of https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8055. Otherwise I think it's pretty much ready to land once CI is happy too :)\r\n ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/888658001/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/888666059","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/8579#issuecomment-888666059","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8579","id":888666059,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM409_fL","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-28T22:38:55Z","updated_at":"2021-07-28T22:51:19Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Followup with @altanh showing that this might be related to a perf regression, we will follow up on this thread","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/888666059/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/888667161","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8274#issuecomment-888667161","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8274","id":888667161,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM409_wZ","user":{"login":"mbrookhart","id":4065489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNjU0ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4065489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart","html_url":"https://github.com/mbrookhart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-28T22:42:13Z","updated_at":"2021-07-28T22:42:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tmoreau89 @zhanghaohit \r\n\r\nI took this suggestion:\r\n> to fix the VTA unittest, we can remove the multiple targets test in deploy_classification.py.

This means that the previous behavior of caching lowered functions (for given input types) globally across all interpreters no longer holds.\r\n\r\n2. in `check_grad` at https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/720e7b1ebd9b789a1100dee7536d0633c7941dd1/python/tvm/relay/testing/__init__.py#L163 notice that the forward function is being recompiled by the interpreter **executor** for **every element of the input tensor**. Important to note here that the interpreter executor is actually creating a new `Interpreter` object for every evaluated expression (and hence losing the cache) causing a complete recompile on each evaluation.\r\n\r\n## Proposed Solution\r\nThe second point can be easily rectified by hoisting the forward function evaluation outside the hot loop, as the function doesn't change. In fact it only needs to be evaluated once per device and target combination. This will immediately fix the extreme regression. A PR will be posted soon.\r\n\r\nRegarding the first point, we would like to move away from relying on hidden global caching for performance as much as possible as this has caused confusion in the past. Thus we will not modify the new interpreter behavior.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/888686075/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/888710642","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8447#issuecomment-888710642","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8447","id":888710642,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM40-KXy","user":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-29T00:36:28Z","updated_at":"2021-07-29T01:46:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@vvchernov I was informed that the test added in this PR is taking more than 20 min of CI time.

To be specific, please see the following example:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> A_shared[i] = A[i]\r\n> A_local[i] = A_shared[i]\r\n> C_local[i] = A_local[i] + 1\r\n> C_shared[i] = C_local[i]\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> Since `A_shared[i]` is never used when we store to `C_shared`. We can directly store the data into `A_shared[i]` to reduce memory usage. It is supported in `storage_rewrite`\r\n\r\nThanks, I didn't think about reuse support. To support this, I think it is better to drop the new pass in this PR and  merge the new functionality to `storage_rewrite` pass. I'll consider both possibilities and try to find the simplest solution.\r\n\r\nOne difficulty I can imagine is that, dynamic shared memory in general has unknown alloc size. So for the general cases I don't think reuse analysis would work just like it does in `storage_rewrite`. For special cases where dynamic shared memory happens to have a constant size, it is probably worth supporting reuse.

export result is not pure json, it's actually a tvm Map object). In the long term, I am in favor of using json exclusively for `target -> str` conversion.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, IIRC we are using the current `str` function (`target->str`) for compatibility with AutoTVM and Ansor (AutoScheduling).

Therefore I did not raise issue ticket.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/890343844/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/890373873","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8586#issuecomment-890373873","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8586","id":890373873,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM41Egbx","user":{"login":"YuchenJin","id":15164320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTY0MzIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15164320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuchenJin","html_url":"https://github.com/YuchenJin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuchenJin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuchenJin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuchenJin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuchenJin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuchenJin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuchenJin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuchenJin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuchenJin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuchenJin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-31T16:45:59Z","updated_at":"2021-07-31T16:47:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Hi @YuchenJin, regarding this PR, what do you think can be further improved or we should have another PR to systematically refactor the API usage? Thanks.\r\n\r\nHi @ganler, I think for this PR you can pass the `params` directly to `create_executor` as following because it has potential performance benefits, and we should make users become used to this style.\r\n```\r\nexecutor = relay.build_module.create_executor(\"graph\", mod, tvm.cpu(0), target, params).evaluate()\r\ntvm_output = executor(tvm.nd.array(x.astype(dtype))).numpy()\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be great if you want to systematically refactor the APIs in another PR, and I'm happy to discuss! Thanks! :)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/890373873/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/890474869","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8605#issuecomment-890474869","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8605","id":890474869,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM41E5F1","user":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-01T08:20:17Z","updated_at":"2021-08-01T08:20:17Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"CC @yzh119 @MasterJH5574 @tkonolige @vinx13 if you guys are interested","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/890474869/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/890475227","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8567#issuecomment-890475227","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8567","id":890475227,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM41E5Lb","user":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-01T08:22:29Z","updated_at":"2021-08-01T08:22:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The PR looks good to me.
