No matter how you will split the key range between 2 consumers there could be a case where both overloaded keys are attached to one consumer.

fundamental problem with this test is that the broker's implementation of anti-affinity does not guarantee that two namespaces in the same anti-affinity group will be placed on different broker nodes. When all of the preferred brokers are overloaded, the `selectBrokerForAssignment` method will choose a broker that has a namespace in the same anti-affinity group. However, the test essentially asserts that two namespaces in the same anti-affinity group should never get placed on the same broker.\r\n\r\nI propose that we set the overloaded threshold config high enough that it won't allow for the preferred broker to be overridden. Additional detail on how I reached this conclusion follows.\r\n\r\nI ran `$ mvn clean test -Dtest=AntiAffinityNamespaceGroupTest -DfailIfNoTests=false -pl pulsar-broker` locally until I got a failure. This snippet from the failed test's logs show the essential information to expose the problem:\r\n\r\n```\r\n15:23:57.910 [TestNG-method=testBrokerSelectionForAntiAffinityGroup-1] INFO  org.apache.pulsar.broker.loadbalance.impl.ModularLoadManagerImpl - 2 brokers being considered for assignment of tenant-b0b0f443-a4b2-4df9-aa38-ff71fe743e89/use/ns1/0x00000000_0xffffffff\r\n15:23:57.910 [TestNG-method=testBrokerSelectionForAntiAffinityGroup-1] WARN  org.apache.pulsar.broker.loadbalance.impl.LeastLongTermMessageRate - Broker http://localhost:57033 is overloaded: max usage=0.8523102402687073\r\n15:23:57.910 [TestNG-method=testBrokerSelectionForAntiAffinityGroup-1] WARN  org.apache.pulsar.broker.loadbalance.impl.LeastLongTermMessageRate - Broker localhost:57033 is overloaded: CPU: 85.231026%, MEMORY: 27.4213%, DIRECT MEMORY: 2.4414062%, BANDWIDTH IN: 0.0%, BANDWIDTH OUT: 0.0%\r\n15:23:57.910 [TestNG-method=testBrokerSelectionForAntiAffinityGroup-1] INFO  org.apache.pulsar.broker.loadbalance.impl.ModularLoadManagerImpl - Selected broker Optional[localhost:57041] from candidate brokers [localhost:57033, localhost:57041]\r\n15:23:57.914 [TestNG-method=testBrokerSelectionForAntiAffinityGroup-1] INFO  org.apache.pulsar.broker.loadbalance.impl.ModularLoadManagerImpl - 1 brokers being considered for assignment of tenant-b0b0f443-a4b2-4df9-aa38-ff71fe743e89/use/ns2/0x00000000_0xffffffff\r\n15:23:57.914 [TestNG-method=testBrokerSelectionForAntiAffinityGroup-1] WARN  org.apache.pulsar.broker.loadbalance.impl.LeastLongTermMessageRate - Broker http://localhost:57033 is overloaded: max usage=0.8523102402687073\r\n15:23:57.914 [TestNG-method=testBrokerSelectionForAntiAffinityGroup-1] WARN  org.apache.pulsar.broker.loadbalance.impl.LeastLongTermMessageRate - Broker localhost:57033 is overloaded: CPU: 85.231026%, MEMORY: 27.4213%, DIRECT MEMORY: 2.4414062%, BANDWIDTH IN: 0.0%, BANDWIDTH OUT: 0.0%\r\n15:23:57.914 [TestNG-method=testBrokerSelectionForAntiAffinityGroup-1] INFO  org.apache.pulsar.broker.loadbalance.impl.ModularLoadManagerImpl - Selected broker Optional[localhost:57033] from candidate brokers [localhost:57033]\r\n15:23:57.916 [TestNG-method=testBrokerSelectionForAntiAffinityGroup-1] WARN  org.apache.pulsar.broker.loadbalance.impl.LeastLongTermMessageRate - Broker http://localhost:57033 is overloaded: max usage=0.8523102402687073\r\n15:23:57.916 [TestNG-method=testBrokerSelectionForAntiAffinityGroup-1] WARN  org.apache.pulsar.broker.loadbalance.impl.LeastLongTermMessageRate - Broker localhost:57033 is overloaded: CPU: 85.231026%, MEMORY: 27.4213%, DIRECT MEMORY: 2.4414062%, BANDWIDTH IN: 0.0%, BANDWIDTH OUT: 0.0%\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe test fails with the following error:\r\n\r\n```text\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTest set: org.apache.pulsar.broker.loadbalance.AntiAffinityNamespaceGroupTest\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTests run: 7, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1, Time elapsed: 65.387 s <<< FAILURE!

It adds value by testing `selectBrokerForAssignment`'s usage of the anti-affinity method (`LoadManagerShared.filterAntiAffinityGroupOwnedBrokers`). Here is a reference to the `selectBrokerForAssignment` method:  https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/d40fb5837fe33fb9f7630f7674e6953bb63ca164/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/loadbalance/impl/ModularLoadManagerImpl.java#L763-L861\r\n\r\nInstead, I think it would make the most sense to set the `overloadedThreshold` high enough that it won't allow the preferred broker to be overridden. In this way, we remove the main caveat on the anti-affinity logic because no broker will be too overloaded. Note that the other caveat is that a second broker has to be available, but I don't believe that has been a problem.\r\n\r\nFor reference, here are the full logs from the test:\r\n\r\n```text\r\n------- Starting test [TestClass name=class org.apache.pulsar.broker.loadbalance.AntiAffinityNamespaceGroupTest].testBrokerSelectionForAntiAffinityGroup([])-------\r\n15:23:57.795 [pulsar-ordered-OrderedExecutor-0-0-EventThread] INFO  org.apache.pulsar.zookeeper.ZooKeeperChildrenCache -

work on this @michaeljmarshall . \r\n\r\nHowever, it seems that the flakiness remains after this change.\r\n\r\nSometimes it's hard to reproduce the flaky test failures locally. One thing that seems to be a common theme is that the flaky test failures happen in CI, but can be hard to produce in local environments. While working on the fix for flaky test MessageIdTest, I found a way to reproduce some flaky test failures effectively by limiting the CPU resources to somewhat similar that there is in CI. The CI tests run on an Azure VM that has 2 cores and about 6GB free RAM (IIRC). \r\n\r\nSince I use Linux for development, the easiest way for me to constraint the resources of the test run was to use Docker. On other than Linux, VM tooling such as https://multipass.run/ could be helpful in creating an environment with limited cpu resources.\r\n\r\nThese are the commands I used to test this change:\r\n```\r\n$ gh pr checkout 9393\r\n$ mvn clean install -DskipTests -Dspotbugs.skip=true\r\n$ docker run --cpus=2 --memory=6g -u 1000:1000 --net=host -it --rm -v $HOME:$HOME -w $PWD -v /etc/passwd:/etc/passwd:ro ubuntu bash -c 'source \"$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh\"; counter=0; while mvn -Pcore-modules -pl pulsar-broker test -DfailIfNoTests=false -Dtest=AntiAffinityNamespaceGroupTest -DredirectTestOutputToFile=false -DtestRetryCount=0; do echo \"----------- LOOP $counter ---------------\"; ((counter++)); done; echo \"LOOP $counter\"' | tee docker_output_`date +%s`.log\r\n```\r\n\r\nhere's the output: https://gist.github.com/lhotari/7d8c7ae0a9e1a26d92599c585ba64e13\r\nand pulsar-broker/target/surefire-reports/testng-results.xml  https://gist.github.com/lhotari/fbbcd1405d8f16be7106f8ece9f66084\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: did not expect [localhost:42919] but found [localhost:42919]\r\nat org.testng.Assert.fail(Assert.java:99)\r\nat org.testng.Assert.failEquals(Assert.java:1041)\r\nat org.testng.Assert.assertNotEqualsImpl(Assert.java:147)\r\nat org.testng.Assert.assertNotEquals(Assert.java:1531)\r\nat org.testng.Assert.assertNotEquals(Assert.java:1535)\r\nat org.apache.pulsar.broker.loadbalance.AntiAffinityNamespaceGroupTest.testBrokerSelectionForAntiAffinityGroup(AntiAffinityNamespaceGroupTest.java:427)\r\nat sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)\r\nat sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:62)\r\nat sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43)\r\nat java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:498)\r\nat org.testng.internal.MethodInvocationHelper.invokeMethod(MethodInvocationHelper.java:132)\r\nat org.testng.internal.InvokeMethodRunnable.runOne(InvokeMethodRunnable.java:45)\r\nat org.testng.internal.InvokeMethodRunnable.call(InvokeMethodRunnable.java:73)\r\nat org.testng.internal.InvokeMethodRunnable.call(InvokeMethodRunnable.java:11)\r\nat java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.run(FutureTask.java:266)\r\nat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1149)\r\nat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:624)\r\nat java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:748)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat comes into mind is that the test might start before both brokers are available. \r\nSomething like https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/24f759c677bfe7cbb2228cab8a38f2ebd0893945/pulsar-discovery-service/src/test/java/org/apache/pulsar/discovery/service/DiscoveryServiceTest.java#L251-L252 could help with that?\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/770633183/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/770647541","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/8403#issuecomment-770647541","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/8403","id":770647541,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MDY0NzU0MQ==","user":{"login":"diegosalvi","id":3481209,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0ODEyMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3481209?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/diegosalvi","html_url":"https://github.com/diegosalvi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diegosalvi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diegosalvi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diegosalvi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diegosalvi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diegosalvi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diegosalvi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diegosalvi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diegosalvi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diegosalvi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-01T07:49:21Z","updated_at":"2021-02-01T07:49:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@eolivelli Thank you.

The PR only gives the root **group** the necessary permissions to access the /pulsar folder. This is because on an openshift cluster, containers are run using a random user ID.\r\n\r\nAn extract from the openshift documentation, see section \"Support arbitrary user ids\" (https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.5/openshift_images/create-images.html)\r\n\r\n> By default, OpenShift Container Platform runs containers using an arbitrarily assigned user ID. This provides additional security against processes escaping the container due to a container engine vulnerability and thereby achieving escalated permissions on the host node.\r\n\r\n> For an image to support running as an arbitrary user, directories and files that may be written to by processes in the image should be owned by the root group and be read/writable by that group. Files to be executed should also have group execute permissions.\r\n\r\n> Adding the following to your Dockerfile sets the directory and file permissions to allow users in the root group to access them in the built image:\r\n\r\n```\r\nRUN chgrp -R 0 /some/directory && \\\r\n    chmod -R g=u /some/directory\r\n```\r\n\r\n> Because the container user is always a member of the root group, the container user can read and write these files.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I think this PR allows for better security by supporting running pulsar by an arbitrary user

I didn't mean that Pulsar IO is a competitor for Kafka Connect, but I would like to share my experience in porting projects that are working on Kafka Connect to Pulsar IO Sinks.\r\n\r\nI recently got stuck in this problem, that when you deal with GenericRecord you cannot have metadata about the Schema, you can only access the raw schema bytes or you have to use Java reflection in order to deal with the type of each field (and this also is a problem because for null values you do not know the original datatype).\r\n\r\nGenericRecord is a wonderful abstraction over generic data structures and it looks to me that the most missing part of the story is about having this kind of metadata about the structure.\r\n\r\nGenericRecord already provides many APIs to create records and create schemas (RecordSchemaBuilder and GenericRecordBuilder) , the only missing part here is to \"read\" that metadata.\r\n\r\nOnce we have this API working with structured data with Pulsar IO (and probably with PulsarFunctions in general) will be more easier.\r\n\r\nDealing directly with Avro (and Protobuf...) is not a good way to go for my usecases, because I will have to explicitly write code for every schema type, and also enter the details of every technology. \r\n\r\nFor simple cases (but GenericRecord is not that simple, it is already very powerful, as it is already able to deal with nested structs) it is a great feature to be able to code your Pulsar Sink independently from the physical encoding of the records, the same way we do with Compression.\r\n\r\n\r\ncc @shiv4289 @aahmed-se
