That benchmark？\r\n\r\n@githublaohu 我用benchmark的prodcuer压测开启消息轨迹的场景，同时想要知道轨迹消息是否出现丢失，所以添加了个属性，可以指定发送多少条消息就测试结束（像jmeter指定请求数一样），比如1亿条等，不会持续运行需要其它方式中止，这样我也方便查看消息轨迹的数量，如果不指定属性，就还是原有执行方式。我猜测可能会有其它同学有相似场景，就顺便提了个pr，如果觉得意义不大，可以关闭这个pr.：https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/2617","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/765068107/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/765338402","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/2619#issuecomment-765338402","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/2619","id":765338402,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2NTMzODQwMg==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-22T11:30:56Z","updated_at":"2021-01-22T11:30:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\n[![Coverage

In a result, there are some classes which produce non-standard json string and will cause compatibility problem.\r\n\r\nHere is what I thought\r\n1. we could make a new bridge serializable class, and let the non-compatibility protocol class extends it, then through request version to distinguish which method to use to serialize/deserialize the class.\r\nThe advantages are the structure of class and meta file will not change, and affect is limited, also the code will be remove easily when client all updated.\r\nThe disadvantages are the dependency of fastjson will exists in a long term and the compatible code maybe not graceful.\r\n2. Other fastjson annotation problems could be fixed by using different gson parameters.\r\n\r\nwhat's the community's opinions?  @vongosling @duhenglucky @RongtongJin @ShannonDing
