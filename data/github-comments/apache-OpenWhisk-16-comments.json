@nicolelovecoding \nIt will be helpful if you could provide steps to reproduce with some generic sample code.\n\nI'm going to assume that you have a javascript action using default runtime nodejs 0.12\nThat you are using the request library provided by npm package request\ntrying to do some type of http request to a web service or web site.\nAnd you are getting this error.\n\nIf you know that that the endpoint you are trying to reach is a valid one, and that it happens to timeout sometimes and you want to retry, you will need to write the logic, or use an npm package like [node-request-retry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-request-retry)\n\nThe problem is that the nodejs runtime only has a fix number of npm package already pre-installed and node-request-retry is not.\n\nYou can use an npm package that is not available by default by bundling 3rd party dependencies into your javascript action, take a look at the following article on how they use webpack to achieve this.\nhttps://developer.ibm.com/openwhisk/2016/03/17/bundling-openwhisk-actions-with-webpack/\n\nFor reference on which packages are available for default you can look at the [source code](https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk/blob/master/core/nodejsAction/Dockerfile) or the [reference doc](https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk/blob/master/docs/reference.md#runtime-environment)\n\nhope this helps, let us know how else we can

Are you using simple or custom? or you getting the error on both?\n2. Are you saying that if you first vagrant ssh, and then run `wsk` from inside the VM it's correct, but running using the vagrant shortcut `vagrant ssh --` is not correct?\n3. How did you setup ssh on windows that vagrant is using? native ssh, cygwin ssh, etc..\n@dubeejw I know you use windows and ssh, and you install ssh, what ssh works for you?\n4. How you fix the problems with `\\r` in linux scripts? I want to document how to setup git for windows users when using the share folder with linux\n5. Can you try to upgrade virtualbox to the latest version.\n\nIt looks like you have two workarounds:\n1. use wsk from inside the vm after `vagrant ssh` like you posted\n2. configure the outside wsk cli on windows with the apihost and key of the vagrant vm, maybe create a script to make it easy to swift from something like bluemix openwhisk and your VM running openwhisk.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/225903406/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/225904835","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/615#issuecomment-225904835","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/615","id":225904835,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNTkwNDgzNQ==","user":{"login":"sjfink","id":1533170,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzMxNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1533170?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink","html_url":"https://github.com/sjfink","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-14T14:45:20Z","updated_at":"2016-06-14T14:45:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"http://slackindwo.mybluemix.net/  may be a better signup page.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/225904835/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/225906057","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/605#issuecomment-225906057","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/605","id":225906057,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNTkwNjA1Nw==","user":{"login":"domdom82","id":1755853,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTU4NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1755853?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82","html_url":"https://github.com/domdom82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-14T14:48:57Z","updated_at":"2016-06-14T14:48:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"rebased. \nremoving WIP. \n@csantanapr I have made changes to db and custom vagrant readmes.
