For e.g. all Aurora containers are of same size and YARN containers cannot be smaller than the limit configured by the YARN admin.

This PR allows users to submit heron jobs to existing nomad clusters.  In another PR, after this one was merged, we introduced a standalone cluster/distributed mode for heron using Nomad as the scheduler.  Before this mode was introduced, users would have to had setup Aurora, YARN, Kubernetes, etc. to run a Heron job using many nodes if they didn't already have a cluster of such available to them.  This was a high barrier for entry to users since many of these schedulers are not easy to setup, if not impossible, if you do not have sudo access.  Since Nomad is so simple to install and start up, we decided to use Nomad as the de facto scheduler/cluster manager for Heron standalone cluster mode.  The code to for setting up a standalone cluster is mainly scripts to start a nomad cluster and copying and templating files.  Like I said before, if a user already has Nomad cluster, they can absolutely use their existing deployment to run Heron jobs.  @dadgar let me know if you have any other questions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/360926016/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/360926746","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/2601#issuecomment-360926746","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/2601","id":360926746,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MDkyNjc0Ng==","user":{"login":"jerrypeng","id":3613359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTMzNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3613359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng","html_url":"https://github.com/jerrypeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-26T22:51:31Z","updated_at":"2018-01-26T22:51:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@dadgar here is some instructions on how to start a standalone cluster via nomad:\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.github.io/heron/docs/operators/deployment/schedulers/standalone/\r\n\r\nWe still have to write some docs on how to deploy to existing nomad cluster","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/360926746/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/360934636","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/2601#issuecomment-360934636","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/2601","id":360934636,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MDkzNDYzNg==","user":{"login":"dadgar","id":1047914,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1047914?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadgar","html_url":"https://github.com/dadgar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadgar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadgar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadgar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadgar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadgar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadgar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadgar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadgar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadgar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-26T23:35:41Z","updated_at":"2018-01-26T23:35:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@jerrypeng Ah thanks for the great answer!

I am not against adding the protection in the needed functions. If storm assumes that, then keeping the same API sounds more reasonable.\r\n\r\nMy concerns are:\r\n\r\n1. even it is a relax, this is an API change, so it is better to be careful. What exactly is the problem? Users need to call \"OutputCollector.sendTuple\" in multiple threads? Any other functions are needed?\r\n2. OutgoingTupleCollection is not an interface layer class and it is shared by both bolt and spout. I can understand the bolt case, but do we need the same protection for spout? Is this the best place to synchronize compare to AbsOutputCollector or BoltOutputCollectorImpl?\r\n3. it seems the current bolt process is: 1. check there is room in outQueue, 2. execute bolt logic, 3. sendout*. We should be clear if add*tuple functions are allowed to be called out of the time window of step 2. If no, then the sendOut* functions are not needed to be synchronized. If yes, I think we have a lot  more to worry about than making these functions to be synchronized.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/361347849/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/361383559","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/2694#issuecomment-361383559","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/2694","id":361383559,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MTM4MzU1OQ==","user":{"login":"joshfischer1108","id":5785700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3ODU3MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5785700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshfischer1108","html_url":"https://github.com/joshfischer1108","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshfischer1108/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshfischer1108/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshfischer1108/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshfischer1108/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshfischer1108/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshfischer1108/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshfischer1108/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshfischer1108/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshfischer1108/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-29T20:56:38Z","updated_at":"2018-01-29T20:56:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@kramasamy All requested changes have been made.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/361383559/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/361408402","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/2694#issuecomment-361408402","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/2694","id":361408402,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MTQwODQwMg==","user":{"login":"lucperkins","id":1523104,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjMxMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1523104?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucperkins","html_url":"https://github.com/lucperkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucperkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucperkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucperkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucperkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucperkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucperkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucperkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucperkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucperkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-29T22:26:43Z","updated_at":"2018-01-29T22:26:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@joshfischer1108 Okay, I see the issue in CI.

To address your concerns:\r\n\r\n1. Yes there are use cases when users will emit and ack tuples from different threads.  For example, there are use cases when a user will put tuples on a queue and ack them later.\r\n\r\n2. We do need this synchronization for spouts as well.  A user can very well want to call emit from different threads.\r\n\r\n3. I am not sure I understand you question.  Are you saying that because users can emit from a different thread, that it might overflow the outQueue?  The current check doesn't prevent a user from overflowing the queue to begin with right?  Even if I am not emitting from a different thread, I can still emit as many times as I want which can potentially overflow the

Thus everytime a stmgr client detects\r\nconnection issues, inform that to stmgrclientmgr which keeps a map of\r\npeerstmgrid to error count. Thus it is able to decide things like am i\r\nseeing connection errors from all stmgrs or if only a few of them are\r\nhaving issues. Then it can take the decisions better.\r\n\r\nReply:\r\n\r\nYeah. That is an option too. In fact it was my first try:\r\nhttps://github.com/twitter/heron/pull/2693 (just an initiative, not\r\ncompleted, a count map should be used instead of a single total count)\r\n\r\nIn most cases, I think both solutions should have the same result. A few\r\nreasons I changed to a tmaster check:\r\n- with tmaster, there is only one source of truth and tmaster is more\r\ncritical anyway. If the tmaster link is not healthy, stmgrs won't work\r\ncorrectly: topology may have created replacement nodes but the disconnected\r\nnodes could keep going by themselves.\r\n- it is more straightforward. The logic is the same as the current one. One\r\nthe other side, if we use an array for all remote stmgrs, we could have a\r\nsmarter logic (which is good) but it could make stmgrs more complicated and\r\nless straightforward (bad). I left the stmgr counters there so if in future\r\nwe decide to add this feature, it should be easy to add.

Lets take two cases\r\n1. Users use only a single thread to do process/ack. In this case, both the current version and the new pr work the same.\r\n2. Users use multiple threads. Then in the current version, even if they acked in the right order, the system does not ensure effectively once, since the system could do checkpointing before tuple_A is acked for example.
