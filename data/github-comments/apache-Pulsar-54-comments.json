To which branches? Until when? By Who?\r\n\r\nI have started the mail thread for almost a month, but really almost no one in the community is interested in discussing the rules.\r\n\r\n> I understand the motivation, however, I think we should discuss rules and policies, and should build a consensus first. Otherwise who can review and maintain the script correctly?\r\n\r\nI have started the discussion in the mail thread. This PR is just to demonstrate a proposal to follow what other project is doing spark, bookkeeper, kafka and many other ASF projects. If the community likes this approach, we can adopt it. If the community doesn't like the approach, it is okay since it is just a proposal, if there is other good approaches, please raise it up in the mail thread.\r\n\r\n> I'm fine with automating boring steps and preventing mistakes by using scripts, but it's questionable to me that we need complicated rules that we cannot manually apply correctly.\r\n\r\nFirst, Labeling the issues and marking milestone. It is the easiest part. If everyone can follow the rules, that is totally fine. However people are just lazy and steps are usually missed. \r\n\r\nSecond, manage the commit message. when you click 'squash and merge' button, if you don't pay attention to copying the description in the PR to the merge text box, you will end up with a commit without description or with a mixed of random commits\r\n\r\nLast, manage the cherry-picks. that is the difficult part. currently we are using milestone for tracking the releases, however a PR can be linked to only one milestone. so if there is no accurate view on how a pull request lands at the git repo. for a release manager, 1) he has to either manually cherry-pick to branches and left a comment in the original pull request, or 2) he has to manually create a new PR for it, which I think it is a load to the release manager. \r\nFor 1), those individual cherry-picks are not interconnected, when you look into a git log in the branch, you will never know if the change is a cherry-pick or a brand new commit. There is almost no way for people to traverse back the original change. \r\nFor 2), it has to going to another review cycle and the problem listed above during merging will occur. \r\n\r\nI don't meant to introduce any overhead to the merging and releasing process. However I do think for Pulsar to become a success project, it has to do something on this management. \r\n\r\nAt the end, to really know the pain points, I would suggest every committer in the community should do at least one bugfix release.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/419144820/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/419171912","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/2526#issuecomment-419171912","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/2526","id":419171912,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxOTE3MTkxMg==","user":{"login":"merlimat","id":62500,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat","html_url":"https://github.com/merlimat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-06T17:12:57Z","updated_at":"2018-09-06T17:12:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":" >  Second, manage the commit message. when you click 'squash and merge' button, if you don't pay attention to copying the description in the PR to the merge text box, you will end up with a commit without description or with a mixed of random commits\r\n\r\nagree with commit message that is not uniformly enforced.

This PR is just to demonstrate a proposal to follow what other project is doing spark, bookkeeper, kafka and many other ASF projects. If the community likes this approach, we can adopt it. If the community doesn't like the approach, it is okay since it is just a proposal, if there is other good approaches, please raise it up in the mail thread.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry for not responding on the mail thread. However, as you commented, a clear policy is what we need. If we just borrowed scripts from another project, the policy would keep unclear to people who are not participating the project.\r\n\r\nI'd like to see the policy that is coded into the script. We can enforce the policy later by using the script.\r\n\r\n> First, Labeling the issues and marking milestone. It is the easiest part. If everyone can follow the rules, that is totally fine. However people are just lazy and steps are usually missed.\r\n\r\nI think we need to get used to doing it, and committers should be responsible for checking these things. ATS community is doing this pretty well without tools. A clear policy would be a help. \r\n\r\n> Second, manage the commit message. when you click 'squash and merge' button, if you don't pay attention to copying the description in the PR to the merge text box, you will end up with a commit without description or with a mixed of random commits\r\n\r\nThe same as above. Committers should take care of this. I don't think automating it always ends up with the best result.\r\n\r\n> Last, manage the cherry-picks. that is the difficult part. currently we are using milestone for tracking the releases, however a PR can be linked to only one milestone.\r\n\r\nI understand the difficulty. ATS community is facing the same issue. To deal with it, they also use Project for backporting request management. It's still too early to say it's working well, but I think it worth to try.\r\n\r\n> For 1), those individual cherry-picks are not interconnected, when you look into a git log in the branch, you will never know if the change is a cherry-pick or a brand new commit. There is almost no way for people to traverse back the original change.\r\n\r\nIn ATS community, they uses `-x`  when they cherry-pick commits. This option appends the original commit hash to the commit log.\r\n\r\n> For 2), it has to going to another review cycle and the problem listed above during merging will occur.\r\n\r\nIn ATS community, they make PRs for backporting only if the commit cannot be cherry-picked cleanly due to conflicts. And RM basically doesn't make PRs by himself but ask the original author to do so because RM isn't familiar with the change/module in some cases. RM just check that PRs are in policy and merge them.\r\n\r\n> I don't meant to introduce any overhead to the merging and releasing process. However I do think for Pulsar to become a success project, it has to do something on this management.\r\n\r\nI understand and agree.\r\n\r\n> At the end, to really know the pain points, I would suggest every committer in the community should do at least one bugfix release.\r\n\r\nI don't disagree but that would take time. Since you are trying to enforce a policy, I guess you already have good examples for explaining the pain and how the policy solve it, right? Why don't you share those examples?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/419464632/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/419482578","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/2526#issuecomment-419482578","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/2526","id":419482578,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxOTQ4MjU3OA==","user":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-07T15:49:22Z","updated_at":"2018-09-07T15:49:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"i think there is a confusion here. There is no policy coded into the script. It is still left to the community to come up with a policy. If you want me to make a proposal about the policy, I am happy to do that. \r\n\r\nWhat the script is really offering is to automating (end enforcing) the steps that committers need to run manually. It is still the committer’s responsibility for choosing labels, milestones and deciding cherrypicks. That says the tool is not the policy, it is trying to standardize what people is doing manually. The discussion of a policy should happen regardless it is manually or automated. \r\n\r\nAs you said, different projects have different way for doing things. Both of us have biases on doing things. ATS might have its practice doing things and it applies to the community. However I do not see that will apply to the community here. Even some of our committers know the “steps”, but they are just forgetting sometimes during their daily engineering life. The tool here is only meant to help automate the steps. It automated the “steps” currently the committers are using manually, so people will have to really think of the steps when doing manually. And again the discussion about the policy (or the steps for merging a PR) should happen regardless it is scripted or manually. \r\n\r\nRegarding the pain points, I have stated what I have observed and encountered in my previous comments. The pain point comes from committer doing things manually, different things are missing during merging and that causes the problems in release. The solution I am proposing is to use a script to automate (and enforce) the steps that committers are doing manually. I provide what I can provide. Not sure what else I can provide. \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/419482578/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/419514407","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/2525#issuecomment-419514407","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/2525","id":419514407,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxOTUxNDQwNw==","user":{"login":"vli02","id":19784896,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Nzg0ODk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19784896?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vli02","html_url":"https://github.com/vli02","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vli02/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vli02/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vli02/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vli02/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vli02/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vli02/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vli02/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vli02/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vli02/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-07T17:42:56Z","updated_at":"2018-09-07T17:42:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Can someone re-run the failed check?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/419514407/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/419516617","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/2526#issuecomment-419516617","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/2526","id":419516617,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxOTUxNjYxNw==","user":{"login":"maskit","id":153144,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzE0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153144?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maskit","html_url":"https://github.com/maskit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maskit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maskit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maskit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maskit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maskit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maskit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maskit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maskit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maskit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-07T17:51:17Z","updated_at":"2018-09-07T17:51:17Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Alright, it seems like I need to read what the script actually does.\r\n\r\nAlthough I haven't read the script at all, I don't understand how we can automate something without policies, rules, whatever.
