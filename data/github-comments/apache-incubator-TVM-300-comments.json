my limited experience playing with TensorIR recently, I realized that almost all tests in TVM import the tir script as `from tvm.script import tir as T` and the same is used in the examples here. But, when we print out the prim_func using `print(func.script())` and try to manually modify parts of it and copy it back into our code, the printed prim_func always uses `tir.prim_func`, `tir.block()`, etc. In other words, it does not alias the `tir` module to `T`.\r\n\r\nIf I understand correctly, one of the original design goals of TVM script is to support this sort of round trip, so would it make sense to try and make the syntax consistent between our examples in the documentation and the actual script being printed so that it's easy to copy paste without having to find and replace all instances of `tir` to `T`.\r\n\r\nI know the programmer can always choose to not alias `tir` module to `T`, but if it's used like that in the documentation, users are going to try and stick to that format.\r\n\r\nJust a small thing I wanted to bring up, let me know your thoughts.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/949759035/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/949759736","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/9344#issuecomment-949759736","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/9344","id":949759736,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM44nC74","user":{"login":"manupak","id":61496855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNDk2ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61496855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak","html_url":"https://github.com/manupak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-22T15:59:48Z","updated_at":"2021-10-22T15:59:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This is merged!

MaskRCNN still traces correctly.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking into the upgrade @masahi, this will be very useful! I've also experienced the import order issue while attempting to trace a PyTorch model. For example,\r\n```python\r\nimport tvm.driver.tvmc as tvmc\r\nimport torch\r\n\r\ntraced_model = tvmc.load(\"mobilenetv2_quantized.pth\", shape_dict={\"input0\": [1, 3, 224, 224]})\r\n```\r\nResults in the following:\r\n```\r\nmunmap_chunk(): invalid pointer\r\nAborted (core dumped)\r\n```\r\nYet after changing the order of imports, it works perfectly fine. The reason I bring this up is because sometimes its not possible to simply swap the order of imports to fix the issue. For example, someone using tvmc directly from the command line. Are you aware of any other ways this could be fixed?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/950685224/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/950705074","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/9299#issuecomment-950705074","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/9299","id":950705074,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM44qpuy","user":{"login":"ekalda","id":15799086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzk5MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15799086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda","html_url":"https://github.com/ekalda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-25T09:14:50Z","updated_at":"2021-10-25T09:14:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"In general I agree that the code behaviour should be tested, but in this case I agree with Luke.

However, for what it's worth, I don't think it is a good idea since I don't think we should test everything just because we can test it. Tests are code to maintain, so we should think carefully what is worth testing and what isn't. There are currently 5184 ICHECKs in the codebase and I don't think many of them are tested. So if we were to test every developer facing assert, we would end up having to maintain lots of not particularly useful tests.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/951667725/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/951714476","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/9367#issuecomment-951714476","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/9367","id":951714476,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM44ugKs","user":{"login":"mikepapadim","id":8652854,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTI4NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8652854?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikepapadim","html_url":"https://github.com/mikepapadim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikepapadim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikepapadim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikepapadim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikepapadim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikepapadim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikepapadim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikepapadim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikepapadim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikepapadim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-26T08:39:25Z","updated_at":"2021-10-26T08:39:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LTGM apart the 2 unit tests","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/951714476/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/951784678","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/9372#issuecomment-951784678","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/9372","id":951784678,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM44uxTm","user":{"login":"Hzfengsy","id":25500082,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTAwMDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25500082?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy","html_url":"https://github.com/Hzfengsy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-26T10:07:48Z","updated_at":"2021-10-26T10:07:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks, @wrongtest.
