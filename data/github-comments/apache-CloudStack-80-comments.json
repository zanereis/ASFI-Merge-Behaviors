Here is what I understood about the compatibility. For example, if our current compute offering is associated with tags (x,y) then the new compute offering should have tags atleast (x,y), then only it can have the same functionality as the current one. Suppose the new offering has the only tag(x), then it is missing the functionality associated with tag(y).\n\nOne more example, Suppose we have three hosts H1,H2,H3.\nThe tags associated with H1 is (x,y), H2 is only (y) and H3 is (x,y,z).\n\nSuppose our current compute offering has (x,y) as host tags. So the VM can be placed in H1 or H3 as both the tags are associated with these hosts but cannot be placed in H2 as tag (x) is missing. But according to the prior situation, it can list a compute offering which has host tag only (y), so the VM can be placed in H2 also. I think this is an issue.
