That way you have control over what versions to exclude and bring in.

Here are my observations.\r\n\r\nWhen I replace all the css, images and js paths with the first '/' removed, the 'en' website seems to be working fine but the 'cn' website styling is broken. On further inspection in the generate  docs/_site I see that the structure of the folders is a default folder that has all the pages for 'en' and a sub folder for 'cn' that has the same pages in Chinese.

manually, then the client is able to write data but the hive sync fails with a class not found, probably because of the hive dependencies missing. I am particularly new to SBT and Maven so I might be missing something simple here, but I would have expected all the transitive dependencies to be installed automatically.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/533140792/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/533190448","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/896#issuecomment-533190448","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/896","id":533190448,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMzE5MDQ0OA==","user":{"login":"yanghua","id":2283778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODM3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2283778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua","html_url":"https://github.com/yanghua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-19T15:42:19Z","updated_at":"2019-09-19T15:42:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bhasudha Maybe the current state is right. We should not remove the first '/'. Please consider a similar example in Flink project:https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/master/docs/_layouts/base.html#L33 (please ignore `{{ site.baseurl }}` for the locally generated HTML files). And these codes would be parsed in like this (in a special full HTML page file):\r\n\r\n```\r\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/page/css/flink.css\">\r\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/page/css/syntax.css\">\r\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/page/css/codetabs.css\">\r\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/page/font-awesome/css/font-awesome.min.css\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I open the local HTML file in the browser, it can not be rendered correctly, it looks like [this image](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12980752/Screen%20Shot%202019-09-19%20at%2011.14.09%20PM.png)\r\n\r\nSo, IMO, we do not need the HTML file to be rendered correctly by opening it in the browser. We just need to check it works OK when we start the site with Jekyll. Additionally, for debugging purposes, Jekyll supports hot-deploy(regenerate and reload changed files automatically and does not need to restart), it does not affect efficiency.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, IMHO, we can ignore this issue.

If this were a problem it should exist even now. Like Spark 2.4.3 supports higher version of Avro, and has support for handling Logical Types by converting to fixed length byte arrays. On Hive 2.3.5 side I believe it will try to convert this fixed length byte arrays back to its own decimal type. It should not necessarily have to understand LogicalType (if I understand correctly).\r\n\r\nThe problem is we are already bundling parquet-avro within the bundle jars. This is making it really difficult to upgrade parquet version. I think Hudi should strive to work with its own versions of parquet/avro irrespective of the consuming application. This particular change should make atleast the Avro version used by Hudi common with that of Spark, and we can claim to always compile Hudi with the version of Spark that is actually writing the dataset.\r\n\r\nIf you are not confident about this change, I can definitely make it configurable like you said. But on EMR side we will have to maintain this to be able to support Hudi with Spark 2.4.3 and Hive 2.3.5.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/534259843/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/534260253","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/915#issuecomment-534260253","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/915","id":534260253,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNDI2MDI1Mw==","user":{"login":"umehrot2","id":8647012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NDcwMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8647012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umehrot2","html_url":"https://github.com/umehrot2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umehrot2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umehrot2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umehrot2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umehrot2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umehrot2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umehrot2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umehrot2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umehrot2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umehrot2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-23T20:00:58Z","updated_at":"2019-09-23T20:00:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Also please prefix the PR with the JIRA it is related to :)\r\n\r\nDone.

This is a quick and dirty way to repro this : You can simply use the docker based demo steps as described in https://hudi.incubator.apache.org/docker_demo.html but have the following changes:\r\n  (a) Pass --payload-class  for all delta-streamer invocations with the class that you created in (1)\r\n  (b) After you ingest the data once using deltastreamer, you can simply add an entry to hoodie.properties file in the dataset .hoodie folder -> Add \"hoodie.compaction.payload.class = <Fully-Qualified-Class-Name-of-Payload-that-you-created-in-step-1>\r\n  (c) Continue the steps.\r\n  (d) In step (6a) where you query Realtime table, you should see the class getting instantiated\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/534552878/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/534572136","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/922#issuecomment-534572136","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/922","id":534572136,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNDU3MjEzNg==","user":{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-24T14:00:39Z","updated_at":"2019-09-24T14:00:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Closing this in favor of JIRA","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/534572136/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/534584283","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/915#issuecomment-534584283","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/915","id":534584283,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNDU4NDI4Mw==","user":{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-24T14:26:51Z","updated_at":"2019-09-24T14:26:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@umehrot2 I am not sure if you want to spend a lot of time reproducing this. May be I can summarize the implications already. \r\n\r\n - HoodieRecordPayload abstraction has return types and parameters that take `GenericRecord`\r\n - Those payload implementations that live in hudi will be properly shaded e.g \r\nOverwriteWithLatestAvroPayload, since they are in the bundle \r\n - If an user implemented his/her own payload outside of Hudi and dropped the jar into Hive (like how we drop the mr-bundle), then for it to work avro needs to be shaded there as well. Otherwise the Hudi parent class will have `org.apache.hudi.org.apache.avro` while the user implementation will have `org.apache.avro` . \r\n\r\nSo seems like we are choosing between custom payloads and logical type support. In the short term, I'd still vote for making either the shading controllable via a -D and get all the data types to work.. then look into how to untangle the shading aspects in a follow on..  \r\n\r\nBy no means, I am trying to pick one over the other. just trying to first get spark 2.4 and all the data types working.. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/534584283/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/534587329","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/917#issuecomment-534587329","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/917","id":534587329,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNDU4NzMyOQ==","user":{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-24T14:33:26Z","updated_at":"2019-09-24T14:33:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":">The other option is that when we set is_incremental as false then we pull all the data at once and then write it.\r\n\r\nthis can be implemented by passing `--checkpoint null` or `--full-load` flag?
