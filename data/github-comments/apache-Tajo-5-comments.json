example of static method in Java class is https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/178/files#diff-f6daa76b2459470a9f3412131c0f726bR34.\n\nI designed the function annotation system to point Function Collection, which is a class including multiple static functions. For user-defined functions and built-in functions, just add function as the example. It is very easy and it enables Tajo to reuse existing functions.\n\nBesides, as you can see, SQL is based on three-valued logic (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic). So, each value can be nullable. Despite of boolean type, one boolean type value can be three values: TRUE, FALSE, and UNKNOWN (NULL in SQL). In the current function system, each function must deal with NULL value explicitly. Most of functions usually return NULL if at least of one parameter is NULL. `Substr` function is an example (https://github.com/apache/tajo/blob/master/tajo-core/src/main/java/org/apache/tajo/engine/function/string/Substr.java#L63). It gives users burden, and it is easy for users to forget NULL handling when users implement user-defined functions.\n\nIn order to mitigate such a problem and to make function invocation more efficiently, I designed new function binder and new function definition approach to keep hints how a function handles NULL value.\n\nThe hints are described in function parameters in a function definition. You can specify the hints by using java primitive type or class primitive type as each parameter according to null handling way. \n\nFor example:\n\nThis `pow` function does not allow NULL values as input parameter. In this case, if at least one parameter is null, this function binder will automatically return NULL value without invoking this function. So, this function itself does not need to handle NULL value explicitly.\n\n```\n@ScalarFunction(name = \"pow\", returnType = FLOAT8, paramTypes = {FLOAT8, FLOAT8})\n   public static double pow(double x, double y) {\n     return Math.pow(x, y);\n}\n```\n\nThe following function definition allow NULL value as both input parameters. In this case, this function must handle NULL value explicitly.\n\n```\n@ScalarFunction(name = \"pow\", returnType = FLOAT8, paramTypes = {FLOAT8, FLOAT8})\npublic static Double pow(Double x, Double y) {\n  if (x == null || y == null) {\n    return null;\n  }\n  return Math.pow(x, y);\n}\n```\n\nIn addition, the function binder allows a mixed use of primitive types and class primitive types. When mixed definition is used, the function binder only allow class primitive types to handle NULL values explicitly.\n\nFinally, the function binder is generated on the fly by java byte code generation technique, and it does not have any overheads even though the logic is very complex. Also, I'm expecting that this idea will remove significantly the overhead of Datum uses in the existing function system.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/57923814/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/57923825","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/178#issuecomment-57923825","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/178","id":57923825,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3OTIzODI1","user":{"login":"hyunsik","id":225941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/225941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik","html_url":"https://github.com/hyunsik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-05T01:37:34Z","updated_at":"2014-10-05T01:37:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"After this patch is committed, I'll add a documentation about how making Tajo user-defined functions using the proposed design.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/57923825/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/57924371","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/177#issuecomment-57924371","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/177","id":57924371,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3OTI0Mzcx","user":{"login":"hyunsik","id":225941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/225941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik","html_url":"https://github.com/hyunsik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-05T02:11:45Z","updated_at":"2014-10-05T02:11:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi @ykrips,\n\nI read the patch in detail.

Please keep going. Although, as we know, index is only useful in the case where the selectivity is low, it has great potential to boost up performance.  If we give users a good guide, index can be a killer feature in this field.\n\nCould you let us know index size and data volume? My primary concern on the current implementation is the index file structure (BSTIndex), which is a large and individual file per task. If your implementation is the same, we can make an effort to investigate its next generation index structure.\n\nIn addition, could you please update index_support branch and reupload your patch. The differences between branch may include lots of other changes.\n\nThanks,\nHyunsik\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/58388360/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/58388782","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/190#issuecomment-58388782","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/190","id":58388782,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4Mzg4Nzgy","user":{"login":"hyunsik","id":225941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/225941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik","html_url":"https://github.com/hyunsik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-08T16:48:54Z","updated_at":"2014-10-08T16:48:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"+1\n\nIt had should do that, but we missed.
