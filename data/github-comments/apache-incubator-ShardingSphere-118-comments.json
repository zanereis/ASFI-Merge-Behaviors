again @tuohai666 ,\r\n\r\nSo based on your advise the issue is now less sever. Let me explain the scenario and maybe you can have a better thought to make the scenario work.\r\n\r\nLet's assume that a client connects to the MySql database server through Sharding-Proxy (client <--> ShardingProxy <--> MySqlServer). Now, we want to intercept the resultset that is going back to the client and manipulate the contents of the resultset. For this, I implemented a few lines of code in the **ProxySQLExecuteCallback** class and modified the body of the **executeSQL** method as below:\r\n```\r\nprivate ExecuteResponse executeSQL(final Statement statement, final String sql, final ConnectionMode connectionMode,\r\n\t\t\tfinal boolean withMetadata) throws SQLException {\r\n\t\tbackendConnection.add(statement);\r\n\r\n\t\tif (jdbcExecutorWrapper.executeSQL(statement, sql, isReturnGeneratedKeys)) {\r\n\t\t\tResultSet resultSet = statement.getResultSet();\r\n\r\n\t\t\tif (sql.toLowerCase().trim().startsWith(\"select\")) {\r\n\t\t\t\tResultSet modifiedResultSet;\r\n\t\t\t\ttry {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tmodifiedResultSet= Modifier.performModification(resultSet);\r\n\t\t\t\t} catch (Exception e) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\te.printStackTrace();\r\n\t\t\t\t\tmodifiedResultSet= resultSet;\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t\tresultSet = modifiedResultSet;\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\tbackendConnection.add(resultSet);\r\n\t\t\treturn new ExecuteQueryResponse(withMetadata ? getQueryHeaders(resultSet.getMetaData()) : null,\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcreateQueryResult(resultSet, connectionMode));\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\treturn new ExecuteUpdateResponse(statement.getUpdateCount(),\r\n\t\t\t\tisReturnGeneratedKeys ? getGeneratedKey(statement) : 0L);\r\n\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd below is the body of Modifier.performModification:\r\n```\r\npublic ResultSet performAnonymization(ResultSet resultSet) throws SQLException {\r\n\t\tif (resultSet == null)\r\n\t\t\treturn resultSet;\r\n\r\n\t\tRowSetFactory factory = RowSetProvider.newFactory();\r\n\t\tCachedRowSet cachedRowSet = factory.createCachedRowSet();\r\n\r\n\t\t// here is the issue\r\n\t\tcachedRowSet.populate(rs);\r\n\r\n\t\twhile (cachedRowSet.next()) {\r\n\t\t\tcachedRowSet.updateString(1, \"some thing\");\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\treturn cachedRowset;\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat I do above works well for PostgreSQL but not for MySql. On cachedRowSet.populate(), it throws an error saying that the connection is still active, which is usually thrown when a resultset is in streaming mode.\r\n\r\n**What I found so far:**\r\nI noticed that MySql says that \"The combination of a **forward-only, read-only result set, with a fetch size of Integer.MIN_VALUE** serves as a signal to the driver to stream result sets row-by-row\". And this is what is happening in the above scenario. I found that in the ProxyJDBCExecutePrepareCallback class, MYSQL_MEMORY_FETCH_ONE_ROW_A_TIME = Integer.MIN_VALUE is used in a situation where connectionMode.equals(ConnectionMode.MEMORY_STRICTLY). \r\n\r\nSo, when I change MYSQL_MEMORY_FETCH_ONE_ROW_A_TIME = 1, the problem is gone. But I want to know the correct way instead of hardcoding the value. Now a few questions: \r\n\r\n1) Is the executeSQL method in the ProxySQLExecuteCallback class the right place to intercept a resultset before being sent to the client? Is it possible that this issue arises because maybe I am working on the resultset too early in ProxySQLExecuteCallback class (e.g., in the preparation mode)? Should I get the returning resultset from somewhere else (maybe later in the process) to modify its content?\r\n\r\n2) How does Sharding-Proxy know if the connection is MEMORY_STRICTLY or not (I think the other option is CONNECTION_STRICTLY)? Is there anything in the configuration that I can set to avoid this? Otherwise, I have to hardcode the MYSQL_MEMORY_FETCH_ONE_ROW_A_TIME equal to 1 to make it work. I tried changing the max.connections.size.per.query: 1000 to see if it goes to the Connection Strictly mode, but it did not help.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your help.\r\nThanks,\r\nParsa\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/618413829/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/618463486","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/5293#issuecomment-618463486","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/5293","id":618463486,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxODQ2MzQ4Ng==","user":{"login":"kimmking","id":807508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzUwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/807508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking","html_url":"https://github.com/kimmking","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-23T15:26:34Z","updated_at":"2020-04-23T15:26:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"remove

To make the question clear, I suggest we don't look inside the sharding-proxy just as I said before(Let's treat sharding-proxy as a black box for now and further discussion). \r\n\r\nI can't find out why you have to modify the codes until you tell me  the exact errors for exceptions appear in the MySQL client(JDBC, CLI, GUI..) which connected to a raw sharding-proxy without modification.\r\n\r\nAnswer a few questions can make things clear:\r\n1. Please response straightforwardly for \" I will change the database name to adventureworks and will update you about the result. \" I found your response may be \"the issue is now less sever\" that is a little ambiguous. Is the issue resolved or part resolved? If part resolved, what left?\r\n\r\n2. Your previous reply:\r\n\r\n> Hi @tuohai666 ,\r\n> Thanks for the reply.\r\n> \r\n> Problem:\r\n> When running executeQuery, I am not able to move forward and backward on the ResultSet (maybe it is defined as forward_only). Therefore, I clone the resultset into a cachedrowset to be able to change the cursor position back and forth. This works for PostgreSQL, but fails for MySql. The error I get is:\r\n> \r\n> java.sql.SQLException: Streaming result set com.mysql.jdbc.RowDataDynamic@6c7bd190 is still active. No statements may be issued when any streaming result sets are open and in use on a given connection. Ensure that you have called .close() on any active streaming result sets before attempting more queries.\r\n\r\nIs the \"Problem:\" found outside the sharding-proxy? That means your MySQL client(JDBC) which connected to a raw sharding-proxy throws this exception.\r\n\r\n3. What problems you met(errors or exceptions you see from the MySQL client) when using a raw sharding-proxy?\r\n\r\n4. Is this issue(#5224) contains multiple topics in addition to the title mentioned?\r\n\r\n5. Is this issue use to report a bug or intend to create a pull request of 'CachedRowSet' relative

@tuohai666 ,\r\nThanks again for the reply. \r\n\r\n> @ppourali I am a little confused now. To make the question clear, I suggest we don't look inside the sharding-proxy just as I said before(Let's treat sharding-proxy as a black box for now and further discussion).\r\n> I can't find out why you have to modify the codes until you tell me the exact errors for exceptions appear in the MySQL client(JDBC, CLI, GUI..) which connected to a raw sharding-proxy without modification.\r\n\r\n> Answer a few questions can make things clear:\r\n> \r\n> 1. Please response straightforwardly for \" I will change the database name to adventureworks and will update you about the result. \" I found your response may be \"the issue is now less sever\" that is a little ambiguous. Is the issue resolved or part resolved? If part resolved, what left?\r\n\r\nI changed the database name to adventureworks based as you suggested. The problem related to \"com.mysql.jdbc.exceptions.jdbc4.MySQLSyntaxErrorException: Table 'mysqlaw.employee' doesn't exist\" is fixed now. So, this side-issue is fixed by changing my datasource name from mysqlaw to adventrueworks in my configuration. Thanks.\r\n\r\n> 2. Your previous reply:\r\n> \r\n> > Hi @tuohai666 ,\r\n> > Thanks for the reply.\r\n> > Problem:\r\n> > When running executeQuery, I am not able to move forward and backward on the ResultSet (maybe it is defined as forward_only). Therefore, I clone the resultset into a cachedrowset to be able to change the cursor position back and forth. This works for PostgreSQL, but fails for MySql. The error I get is:\r\n> > java.sql.SQLException: Streaming result set com.mysql.jdbc.RowDataDynamic@6c7bd190 is still active. No statements may be issued when any streaming result sets are open and in use on a given connection. Ensure that you have called .close() on any active streaming result sets before attempting more queries.\r\n> \r\n> Is the \"Problem:\" found outside the sharding-proxy? That means your MySQL client(JDBC) which connected to a raw sharding-proxy throws this exception.\r\n> \r\n> 1. What problems you met(errors or exceptions you see from the MySQL client) when using a raw sharding-proxy?\r\n\r\nOK; multiple things: \r\na) For MySQL database connection: The rs.first() and rs.previous() and CachedRowSet all **WORK** outside the sharding proxy (raw blackbox). No issue with this.\r\n\r\nb) THIS IS NOT ABOUT SHARDING PROXY RAW *** For MySQL database connection: CachedRowSet populate **FAIL** when running inside the Sharding Proxy code (which is my actual issue now with the stream mode). As mentioned, my scenario is to modify the data before presenting it to the client. I assume I attempt to modify the resultset too early in the sharding proxy because the populate method works outside the sharding proxy well.\r\n\r\nc) For PostgreSQL database connection: The rs.first() and rs.previous() both **FAIL** outside the sharding proxy (raw blackbox). This sounds really weird to me.\r\n_org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: Operation requires a scrollable ResultSet, but this ResultSet is FORWARD_ONLY._\r\n\r\nd) For PostgreSQL database connection: The rs.updateString(column, value) **FAIL** outside the sharding proxy (raw blackbox).\r\n_org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: ResultSets with concurrency CONCUR_READ_ONLY cannot be updated._\r\n\r\ne) For PostgreSQL database connection: CachedRowSet populate **WORKS** when running inside the Sharding Proxy code as well as outside the raw sharding proxy. So there is no issue for PostgreSQL and cached row set be it inside the Sharding Proxy or outside. \r\n\r\n> 2. Is this issue(#5224) contains multiple topics in addition to the title mentioned?\r\nYes, probably.\r\n\r\n> 3. Is this issue use to report a bug or intend to create a pull request of 'CachedRowSet' relative feature?\r\n- I think cases c and d are bugs.\r\n- For case b, I just need your advice on a possible place to grab the resultset and modify it within the Sharding Proxy (I am writing a data masker kind of thing, so that is why I need to modify the data inside Sharding proxy). I am currently intercepting the resultset in the ProxySQLExecuteCallback class but I get the error of case b mentioned above.\r\n_java.sql.SQLException: Streaming result set com.mysql.jdbc.RowDataDynamic@6c7bd190 is still active. No statements may be issued when any streaming result sets are open and in use on a given connection. Ensure that you have called .close() on any active streaming result sets before attempting more queries._\r\n\r\nI hope I made things more clear now. So, my main issue is Case b which is NOT really with the raw sharding proxy. The reason of why I keep asking over and over about how to modify the Sharding Proxy is that my scenario is to mask data before sending it to the client. \r\n\r\nThanks again, I know this is becoming very complicated now.\r\n\r\nBest

The problem I have found is that it is started with helm.When mysql is not started, sharding-proxy will report an error after startup and cannot connect to mysql.However, after mysql started correctly, sharding proxy still failed to connect to mysql after reporting an error. I observed the log time, but sharding proxy did not retry to connect to mysql.
