it was not the comment that concerns me. What concerns me is that we have a method named getUrl() (present in both SiteToSiteClientConfig and the SiteToSiteClient.Builder), and that method returns a String that is no longer a valid URL. Given that the method name is getUrl(), it is very reasonable to expect someone to write code like the following:\n\n`final URL url = new URL(clientConfig.getUrl());`\n\nAnd in fact we did something very similar in the client. This will now throw an Exception because getUrl() may not be returning a valid URL. There are many reasons that may be done - not just by someone implementing a client. Also, we can't assume that \"the URL is what they configured by themselves.\" Certainly, code can be written to pass this object around. There's no telling where it came from.\n\nWe also must keep in mind that while Apache Flink, Storm and Spark integration may be safe, we have no idea what other projects may be using the client.\n\nSo my recommendation would be this: have a method named getUrls() that returns a comma-separated list of URL's, just like getUrl() does now in this PR. Then, add a getUrl() to maintain backward compatibility but make that method return the first URL available and mark it as deprecated with documentation as to why it's deprecated and why we now recommend use of getUrls() instead.\n\nDoes that seem reasonable?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/261536300/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/261549764","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1239#issuecomment-261549764","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1239","id":261549764,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTU0OTc2NA==","user":{"login":"andrewmlim","id":18287533,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4Mjg3NTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18287533?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewmlim","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewmlim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewmlim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewmlim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewmlim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewmlim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewmlim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewmlim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewmlim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewmlim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewmlim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-18T14:51:06Z","updated_at":"2016-11-18T14:51:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @scottyaslan.

I resolved those with @markap14 's help. Now I set up two client certificates and two user identities -- myself and \"Matt\". We have the same permissions except that Andy can add restricted components and Matt cannot. \n![Different access policies for restricted components](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/798465/20460012/74e3d204-ae8a-11e6-9f19-2d838d306815.png)\n\nI then began adding components while logged in as Andy and Matt in separate windows. Andy was able to add and modify _restricted_ components, while Matt was not. \n<img width=\"1920\" alt=\"Side by side canvases as different users\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/798465/20460020/ac5564c8-ae8a-11e6-94c0-52e278122c15.png\">\n\n![Matt cannot add a restricted component](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/798465/20460024/b81ade00-ae8a-11e6-859f-0fa338ebd8a2.png)\n\n![Matt cannot modify an existing restricted component](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/798465/20460031/d75ab3b2-ae8a-11e6-8e5e-301ff0f3b1af.png)\n\nI really like the small shield icon in the Add Processor dialog which has hover text explaining the restriction. \n![Hover text explaining the restriction](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/798465/20460037/fe5d8dc2-ae8a-11e6-95df-6b23e9799115.png)\n\nI think we can do more to indicate the restrictions, however. In the Add Processor dialog, I think it makes sense to put a textual indicator in the description area at the bottom above the processor description -- perhaps red text saying \"Restricted Processor\". I also think we should update the restricted processors with a _Restricted_ tag so they can be quickly enumerated from the tag cloud or search field. I should be able to type \"restr...\" and see a list of all the restricted processors. \n\nI also think it makes sense to show the shield icon (I was originally going to suggest a lock icon but I do like the shield) on processors that are already on the canvas. I think this will also help users who have a processor which we have now decided is restricted already on their canvas and they suddenly do not have access to it because of the new policy enforcement. \n\nI am willing to +1 and merge this (I made one small checkstyle correction in `ITProcessorAccessControl.java` in Javadoc to resolve an issue), but would like to hear from @mcgilman how much work would be involved in addressing the minor suggestions I made above. They could be separated into a new enhancement Jira if necessary, pending release vote timing, as I think the current work does meet what was discussed in the original Jira. \n\nThanks Matt. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/261755436/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/261822574","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1250#issuecomment-261822574","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1250","id":261822574,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTgyMjU3NA==","user":{"login":"ijokarumawak","id":1107620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak","html_url":"https://github.com/ijokarumawak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-21T01:28:18Z","updated_at":"2016-11-21T01:28:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Reviewing...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/261822574/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/261823179","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1250#issuecomment-261823179","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1250","id":261823179,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTgyMzE3OQ==","user":{"login":"ijokarumawak","id":1107620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak","html_url":"https://github.com/ijokarumawak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-21T01:35:36Z","updated_at":"2016-11-21T01:35:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I've confirmed the upgrade works without problem using my Azure environment. +1, merged into master.\r\nI agree with the idea of improving integration test.

When performing the migration of `flow.xml.gz` with an already-encrypted `nifi.properties` but using the `-x`/`--encryptFlowXmlOnly` flag, the new `nifi.sensitive.props.key` value is manually encrypted and updated in the `NiFiProperties` object before being re-serialized to the file. However, because this was not going through the normal \"encrypt the entire object\" logic, the protection scheme in `nifi.sensitive.props.key.protected` was being erased. This resulted in cipher text being stored as the key without an indicator of how to decrypt it. \r\n\r\nI added an assertion in the test covering this scenario and was able to reproduce immediately. I applied the fix and pushed. Thanks Yolanda.

The new commit perfectly addresses the concern that I had with the Builder. I do think we should update the RemoteProcessGroup & DTO as well. The DTO could still have a getTargetUri() that would return the first value entered, just as the builder does now, and then also have a getTargetUris() that returns all of them. Along those lines, it may make sense to not event deprecated the getUri() method and simply document that it returns the first one entered by the user and the getUris() method returns all of them. The DTO may also require having a setTargetUri() and setTargetUris(). I'm just very hesitant to return a comma-separated list of URI's when we have a method named getUri(), etc. This would also have the added benefit of keeping the UI clean, showing a single URI if we want to. @mcgilman do you have any thoughts on how the RPG DTO should change (or not)?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/263390632/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/263394412","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1208#issuecomment-263394412","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1208","id":263394412,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MzM5NDQxMg==","user":{"login":"mcgilman","id":123395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzM5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman","html_url":"https://github.com/mcgilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-28T21:07:11Z","updated_at":"2016-11-28T21:07:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think what @markap14 outlined above would be fine.
