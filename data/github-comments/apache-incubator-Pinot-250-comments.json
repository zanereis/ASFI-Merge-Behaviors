Logging during tests is only useful if it is being read (so most likely it is ignored during a succesful run), so it should be reduced to a minimum (and where the logged data is important, it should be converted to an assertion).\r\n\r\nI can see it may be useful to log less but... numbers don't show that it is an expensive operation. Specifically, tests on this PR took as long as tests in other PRs. I can see advantages when logs are being read (GH takes quite long to load 20k log lines from the other PRs while it is pretty fast with the 2k in this PR) and I'm glad to merge this because it can help to detect maven issues in the future, but we need to include some text indicating how to enable logs in case we want to fix a broken

It would say the schema is in use. Deleting the table in the UI doesn't delete the schema. And that's a common source of confusion for our users when iterating.\r\n\r\nI was thinking the confirmation modal you get when it asks \"are you sure you want to delete\" could get extended to add a few checkbox. The first 2 that I think make sense are: \r\n- `delete the schema` - that would just do both deletions at once and route you back to the tables page\r\n-  `delete immediately` - the 7d retention default can be really annoying. especially for large tables. And there's no async delete, so you just have to close the tab and move on.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2359669856/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2360000392","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/13298#issuecomment-2360000392","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/13298","id":2360000392,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c6Mqr-I","user":{"login":"KKcorps","id":5559703,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTk3MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5559703?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKcorps","html_url":"https://github.com/KKcorps","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKcorps/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKcorps/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKcorps/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKcorps/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKcorps/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKcorps/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKcorps/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKcorps/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKcorps/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-19T05:20:20Z","updated_at":"2024-09-19T05:55:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"hi @jadami10 thanks for bringing this up.\r\n\r\nthe earlier metric was really noisy since it relies on time column value instead of ingestion time which lead to false positives.\r\n\r\nwould making this metric configurable help? that way you'd be able to disable it without code changes\r\n\r\n\r\nlet me also see it there's a way to reduce frequency","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2360000392/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2360247839","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/14026#issuecomment-2360247839","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/14026","id":2360247839,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c6MroYf","user":{"login":"rfscholte","id":150992,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDk5Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/150992?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfscholte","html_url":"https://github.com/rfscholte","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfscholte/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfscholte/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfscholte/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfscholte/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfscholte/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfscholte/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfscholte/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfscholte/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfscholte/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-19T07:52:27Z","updated_at":"2024-09-19T07:52:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"In this case commons-io is not a project dependency but a test resources, which is being downloaded by Maven.

There's 2 fields in https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/master/pinot-spi/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/spi/stream/StreamMessageMetadata.java#L71, `getRecordIngestionTimeMs` and `getFirstStreamRecordIngestionTimeMs` with 2 corresponding metrics to distinguish between between source time and publish time.\r\n\r\n> would making this metric configurable help? that way you'd be able to disable it without code changes\r\n\r\nOnly if we don't have a way to cap frequency. And it should be off by default.\r\n\r\n> let me also see it there's a way to reduce frequency\r\n\r\nI think a key part here is we need to cap the frequency. For large Pinot deployments, you may have thousands of tables and hundreds of thousands of partitions consumed. So the baseline is O(100k) calls. But adding a new table consuming N partitions shouldn't add N more calls. We effectively need a global throttle, though I don't think there's a way to prevent starvation with large enough scale.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2361386066/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2362013248","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/14032#issuecomment-2362013248","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/14032","id":2362013248,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c6MyXZA","user":{"login":"dependabot[bot]","id":49699333,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDk2OTkzMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/29110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/dependabot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-19T19:25:20Z","updated_at":"2024-09-19T19:25:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"OK, I won't notify you again about this release, but will get in touch when a new version is available.

I've been working in Devo Inc, a company that is focused on the timeseries market (trying to compete with Splunk) and there we designed our own streaming SQL database that supports both SQL and LINQ expressions. The later is closer to the M3QL language proposed in the design document and the language most customers used to use.\r\n\r\nI've also created an internal proposal in StarTree to discuss about this feature. It can be read [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YsxJHI58jtOoz9VtU90pUx-rKvS7ql3bpU07Kqylx9M). My document is not focused on the language itself. I believe SQL is expressive enough to be able to execute this kind of queries, but I understand that the market is not there and supporting M3QL and specially PromQL will be probably more useful to attract users.\r\n\r\nI have some concerns about the designed document:\r\n1. My main concern about the proposed design document is that I don't think we need to add too many new concepts on top of the multi-stage query engine (MSQE). Instead, what I think we need to add is some key functions and some special operators (specifically for aggregate, window and join) that should work in streaming fashion.\r\n3. I think the design is too broad and ambitious. I would split it in the following:\r\n    1. Add streaming capabilities to the current MSQE. Basically the tumble functions and window base aggregate, join and probably window functions.\r\n    2. Add the plugable syntax/protocol support. There is where we would think about how to add M3QL, etc.\r\n    3. Add the ability to extend aggregates. The current design assumes this is going to be needed to support other syntaxes, but I don't think this should be part of the time series design given that is also something that would help normal queries. We have recently added the ability to create new scalar and transformation functions using typesafe and it was a hard job to do, so I think we should think about long term support when adding a way to add aggregate functions.\r\n\r\nAnyway I know I'm late to the party and several key PRs have been merged so it doesn't make sense to discuss too much about the past, but please take me also in consideration for future developments.\r\n\r\nAgain, I don't want to sound very pessimistic. I think this is an awesome feature for Apache Pinot and it is great to see it progress that fast!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2370637551/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2370935188","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/13760#issuecomment-2370935188","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/13760","id":2370935188,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c6NUZmU","user":{"login":"ankitsultana","id":8644710,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NDQ3MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8644710?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankitsultana","html_url":"https://github.com/ankitsultana","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankitsultana/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankitsultana/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankitsultana/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankitsultana/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankitsultana/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankitsultana/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankitsultana/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankitsultana/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankitsultana/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-24T10:57:12Z","updated_at":"2024-09-24T10:57:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@gortiz thanks Gonzalo for sharing your views. There are several points made by you here and in the design document, but I think it's best to first establish the broader picture in which we are doing this.\r\n\r\nAs you know, most companies have been using Pinot for OLAP on mainly \"events\". The idea being that you can power user-facing dashboards or other end-user App UI elements like counters based on Realtime data with low latency.\r\n\r\nAt least at Uber, over the last 2 years, we have seen an increase in the number of users who are using Pinot for alerting and monitoring (\"metrics\"). And recently we also shared in the Uber Meetup that we are now using Pinot for our logging platform too. (side-note: Pinot specifically solves the problem of High Cardinality Metrics)\r\n\r\nThe term being used these days to cover this landscape of use-cases is [MELT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgrDLykZ21I): Metrics, Events, Logs and Traces.\r\n\r\nPinot is able to solve all of these problems, but its capability to solve all of these problems differs. What our proposal aims to do is to immediately improve Pinot's ability to tackle the Metrics and the Logging problem, and IMO bring it up to the state of the art in the HICAM space. (note that CH also announced in their latest release that they [plan to support PromQL](https://clickhouse.com/blog/clickhouse-release-24-08)).\r\n\r\nre: your proposal about Streaming queries in Pinot, I think it's talking about a different problem.\r\n\r\nre: your specific points about this not being necessary and we can leverage the MSE or add enable some SQL extensions, I shared the transformNull (gapfill) example in the doc which should help clear that up. For other readers, see the comment thread [at the bottom of this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SBDDf71QZINYUjAbRSWguNMfbrWRGfdcF1JPi8SJZlM/edit)\r\n\r\nFinally, I think this time-series engine may stick out like a sore thumb right now, but once we integrate it with the Multistage Engine Shuffle Framework, I think it will sit very neatly with the rest of the code. And from a use-case perspective, it takes Pinot forward and expands its capabilities around use-cases that it theoretically can already support, but can't support as well. (side-note: from a high-level, I am thinking in the direction that we will have a common Operator interface in the SPI that will be oblivious of the data-model: relational, time-series, etc.)\r\n\r\nA potential future direction is that we may make the entire engine (above the V1 server level engine) pluggable, but it might make sense to consider that after making sure that the time-series engine becomes a success first.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2370935188/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2370996635","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/14069#issuecomment-2370996635","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/14069","id":2370996635,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c6NUomb","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-24T11:27:42Z","updated_at":"2024-09-24T18:10:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## [Codecov](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/14069?dropdown=coverage&src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=apache) Report\nAll modified and coverable lines are covered by tests :white_check_mark:\n> Project coverage is 64.87%.
