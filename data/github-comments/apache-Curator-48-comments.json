When the curator is created against a list of nodes, the underlying zookeeper client is provided the same list of nodes. After connection, the <tt>EnsembleTracker</tt> receives a configuration event with the same list of nodes, but it resolves those names to IPs and sets that as the connection string.</p>\n\n<p>When the zookeeper node the client connected with goes away, the curator connection state becomes SUSPENDED before connecting to another node and changing to RECONNECTED. The original node comes back up on another IP and the other node in the cluster also cycles to a new IP before the node we reconnected to goes down.</p>\n\n<p>At this point zookeeper tries to connect to the IP address for the original node, either from the connection string update or something cached internally. That connection fails, since that IP isn't a zookeeper node. The same is then tried for the original IP of the second node the client had connected with, which is also not a zookeeper node anymore. Followed by an attempt at the IP for the third node, to which the client had never connected and something (curator or zookeeper) had earlier resolved to a now useless IP.</p>\n\n<p>After all this, the client is unable to connect to any zookeeper nodes even though all the requested hosts exist at different IPs. Curator closes the client and creates a new one, but the connection string was changed to IP addresses before any of the nodes changed and that client will never be able to connect to zookeeper.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>Why does curator resolve the hostnames to IPs that will never update?</p>\n\n<p>Is that action on the connection string why zookeeper starts using old IPs after nodes go down, even though it originally used the hostnames?</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604792648/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604792651","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/curator/issues/1154#issuecomment-2604792651","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/1154","id":2604792651,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQjg0c6bQftL","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-17T14:31:15Z","updated_at":"2025-01-21T13:50:32Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=JIRAUSER289461\">JIRAUSER289461</a>:</i>\n<p>Further debugging indicates that curator updating the connection string is what makes zookeeper stop using the hostnames, as the config event causes a call to <tt>Zookeeper.updateServerList</tt>, which updates the <tt>StaticHostProvider</tt> with a connection string that only contains IPs.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604792651/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/1132416300","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/curator/pull/401#issuecomment-1132416300","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/401","id":1132416300,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQjg0c5Df00s","user":{"login":"tisonkun","id":18818196,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4ODE4MTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18818196?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun","html_url":"https://github.com/tisonkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-20T03:20:31Z","updated_at":"2022-05-20T03:20:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@Randgalt LGTM.

@tisonkun @eolivelli and @Randgalt ,\r\nThank you for your reply. This problem is unusual. I got this problem when running unit tests in other project which relies on Zookeeper. The unit tests are running parallelly so that TestServer creating process might get a race condition when allocating unused ports. Currently my solution is the steps below:\r\n1. Get a random unused port.\r\n2. Implementing a file lock.\r\n3. Allocating the port to TestServer.\r\n4. Check if TestServer starts properly. If it starts successfully, release the file lock.\r\nI would like to move those steps inside TestServer creation and start process. However I worry that introducing a file lock might not be the best solution as it only solves an unusual problem at the cost of performance degradation. \r\nHave you got any better ideas? I think using the file lock should be considered as the last resort.

wrong.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/1141583133/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/1143618630","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/curator/pull/385#issuecomment-1143618630","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/385","id":1143618630,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQjg0c5EKjxG","user":{"login":"mariouso","id":95434126,"node_id":"U_kgDOBbA1jg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95434126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariouso","html_url":"https://github.com/mariouso","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariouso/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariouso/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariouso/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariouso/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariouso/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariouso/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariouso/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariouso/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariouso/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-01T13:32:50Z","updated_at":"2022-06-01T13:32:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi
