All ops that forget to set `FListInputNames` properly suffer from this problem, because the default implementation of `FListInputNames` is return `{\"data\"}`. The basic idea of the patch is to separate parameters from inputs in op arguments. (`add_arguments()` to `add_input()`, `add_arguments()` to `add_params()`). In this way, we don't need `set_num_inputs()` and `FListInputNames` any more.

have also met this problem when I try to get an iterator following the [documentation of MNISTIter](http://mxnet.io/api/python/io.html#mxnet.io.MNISTIter).  I use Python instead of R.\r\n\r\nThe code I used was:\r\n```\r\nimport mxnet as mx\r\n\r\ntrain_iter = mx.io.MNISTIter(image='./train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz',\r\n        label='./train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz',\r\n        batch_size=16)\r\n```\r\nBut I got the following error message:\r\n>terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::bad_alloc'\r\n> what():  std::bad_alloc\r\n>Aborted (core dumped)\r\n\r\nAt first I thought it was because the batch_size was too large, so I set a smaller batch_size. I still got the same error.\r\n\r\nAfter reading this issue,  I realize that the MNIST data should be uncompressed first. \r\nAfter uncompressing the data, I run the following code:\r\n```\r\nimport mxnet as mx\r\n\r\ntrain_iter = mx.io.MNISTIter(image='./train-images-idx3-ubyte',\r\n        label='./train-labels-idx1-ubyte',\r\n        batch_size=16)\r\n```\r\nThen, everything is fine.  The output message is like this:\r\n>[10:40:49] src/io/iter_mnist.cc:94: MNISTIter: load 60000 images, shuffle=1, shape=(16,1,28,28)\r\n\r\nI think there is some ambiguity  for the parameter `image` and `label` in the [documentation of the MNISTIter](http://mxnet.io/api/python/io.html#mxnet.io.MNISTIter).  It would be clearer to state that the data and label of MNIST dataset should be uncompressed first before used by MNISTIter.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/292839683/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/292840556","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/5746#issuecomment-292840556","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/5746","id":292840556,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5Mjg0MDU1Ng==","user":{"login":"nopattern","id":749753,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0OTc1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/749753?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nopattern","html_url":"https://github.com/nopattern","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nopattern/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nopattern/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nopattern/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nopattern/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nopattern/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nopattern/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nopattern/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nopattern/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nopattern/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-10T03:20:12Z","updated_at":"2017-04-10T03:20:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Problem solved by add `#define MSHADOW_USE_SSE 0` in prep_nnvm.sh and Makefile.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/292840556/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/292840895","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/5748#issuecomment-292840895","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/5748","id":292840895,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5Mjg0MDg5NQ==","user":{"login":"Godricly","id":17567935,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTY3OTM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17567935?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Godricly","html_url":"https://github.com/Godricly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Godricly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Godricly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Godricly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Godricly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Godricly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Godricly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Godricly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Godricly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Godricly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-10T03:23:17Z","updated_at":"2017-04-10T03:23:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"1.

This is a fairly common convention for representing sequences. The weights are represented as a vector of floats. This is necessary because there is an unbounded number of possible weight matrices possible (as you can stack many layers together). I think MXNet recently got a converter that takes the flat vector and returns a dictionary of weight matrices and bias vectors.
