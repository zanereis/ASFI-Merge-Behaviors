First, I don't think these change will negatively impact the normal single threaded case in any way.   Second, I can't come the conclusion that these changes are completely correct for the multi-threaded case because I don't have a good sense of what specific problems are happening in the multi-threaded case.  In order to reason if this PR solves the problems, I need to know what the problems are.  \n\nI do think these changes are a good improvement and are ready to merge. They definitely solve some subset of multi-threaded problems, just not sure if all.   \n\nOne of thing I thought of that may be useful to try in the test is having threads close RFiles while other threads are reading from deep copies.   Doing this in a continuous manner with multiple RFile concurrently, such that some threads are opening and reading rfiles and other threads are closing those rfiles.  This would attempt to force multiple threads to use the same decompressor.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/245713293/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/245724085","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/134#issuecomment-245724085","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/134","id":245724085,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NTcyNDA4NQ==","user":{"login":"ivakegg","id":347158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NzE1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/347158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivakegg","html_url":"https://github.com/ivakegg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivakegg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivakegg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivakegg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivakegg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivakegg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivakegg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivakegg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivakegg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivakegg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-08T20:09:36Z","updated_at":"2016-09-08T20:09:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@keith-turner I added a good description in the jira ticket of the various issues related to multi threading that I discovered.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/245724085/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/245725318","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/134#issuecomment-245725318","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/134","id":245725318,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NTcyNTMxOA==","user":{"login":"ivakegg","id":347158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NzE1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/347158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivakegg","html_url":"https://github.com/ivakegg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivakegg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivakegg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivakegg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivakegg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivakegg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivakegg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivakegg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivakegg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivakegg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-08T20:14:08Z","updated_at":"2016-09-08T20:14:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I will be happy to continue trying to reproduce the various problems as described (now in detail) within the jira ticket.

I don't like falling back to 'slaves' file if 'tservers' does not exist as all scripts that depend on 'tservers' need to do this.  A proper error message is sufficient.  It's an easy fix.  I will add the following checks to the script and update the PR:\n- First, fail if 'slaves' file exists and tell user to rename file to 'tservers' or remove 'slaves' if both exist.
