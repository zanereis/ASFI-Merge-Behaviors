Fix Kafka unit tests</p>\n\n<p>    This fixes two unit test failures in external/kafka I saw when running tests repeatedly, especially on low resource VMs.</p>\n\n<p>    There was a race in the Exponential Backoff Manager that was fixed by switching the test to use simulated time.</p>\n\n<p>    The Kafka Utils Test was seeing failures on underpowered systems due to a timeout value that was too small. Added log4j2 properties xml to be able to change the log level printed in the output. Also changed metadata.fetch.timeout.ms to max.block.ms, as kafka 0.9 had deprecated the config. The test output had warnings like</p>\n\n<p>    39890 <span class=\"error\">&#91;main&#93;</span> WARN o.a.k.c.p.KafkaProducer - metadata.fetch.timeout.ms config is deprecated and will be removed soon.

Fix Kafka unit tests</p>\n\n<p>    This fixes two unit test failures in external/kafka I saw when running tests repeatedly, especially on low resource VMs.</p>\n\n<p>    There was a race in the Exponential Backoff Manager that was fixed by switching the test to use simulated time.</p>\n\n<p>    The Kafka Utils Test was seeing failures on underpowered systems due to a timeout value that was too small. Added log4j2 properties xml to be able to change the log level printed in the output. Also changed metadata.fetch.timeout.ms to max.block.ms, as kafka 0.9 had deprecated the config. The test output had warnings like</p>\n\n<p>    39890 <span class=\"error\">&#91;main&#93;</span> WARN o.a.k.c.p.KafkaProducer - metadata.fetch.timeout.ms config is deprecated and will be removed soon. Please use max.block.ms</p>\n\n\n<p>You can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:</p>\n\n<p>    $ git pull <a href=\"https://github.com/ppoulosk/storm\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/ppoulosk/storm</a> FixKafkaUnitTests</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1335.patch\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1335.patch</a></p>\n\n<p>To close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch<br/>\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:</p>\n\n<p>    This closes #1335</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>commit 38cf3f3d2f594023260efd853a2255306a0e6190<br/>\nAuthor: Paul Poulosky <ppoulosk@thenperfect-lm.champ.corp.yahoo.com><br/>\nDate:   2016-04-12T19:17:44Z</p>\n\n<p>    Fix tests</p>\n\n<hr />","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612887677/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612874092","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/5395#issuecomment-2612874092","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/5395","id":2612874092,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI4NzQwOTI=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-13T07:21:33Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T16:03:00Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=raviraj\">raviraj</a>:</i>\n<p>Even if the topology workers are getting restarted, why should it lead to discarding a message.
