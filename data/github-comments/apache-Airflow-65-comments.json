For your org, you may strongly consider setting it to True since you'd like to unclutter your UI.\n- `enable_show_hide_paused_dags` (defaulted to False)\n  - This determines whether your new feature is enabled/disabled. By default, it will be disabled and the expectation is that the DAG Overview page will look the same as it does today\n\nAt Agari, we sometimes pause a DAG and then forget to re-enable it. Hiding paused DAGs would make it easier for us to forget to re-enable them. However, I believe this feature is useful enough to allow merging given an additional configuration parameters.\n\nAnother thing I think you need to think about is that your paused dags are still getting parsed. The new scheduler launches a subprocess to parse each dag file.

Why would anyone create an xcom object and isn't that both dangerous and undesirable. I realize that flask makes it very easy to add functionality to views that are not intended. A great example is the create view for dag runs, which makes absolutely no sense to me -- I think @normster might have removed it.. (hopefully) ..\n\nAnyway, consider disabling create.
