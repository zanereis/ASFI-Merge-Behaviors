assignment is made possible by keeping separate interpreterfactory, searchservice... per web user session.\n\nTo ensure backwards compatibility, I propose (not yet implemented) a `zeppelin.notes.per-user` configuration being `false` by default.\n\nThe other repository implements (azure, github...) need more love with the credential service (each user can have their own

@jongyoul , change it to `isolated` works. \nRegarding the option complexity, I still have concern on that.  So now there's 2 dimensions for interpreter (user/note) IIUC. Before 0.6, zeppelin don't support shiro and it makes sense to take note as the dimension.  I guess the reason we introduce `shared`, `scopes`, `isolated` is because at that time we don't have shiro, but we want to control whether to share or isolate SparkContext between users. so we introduce `shared`, `scopes`, `isolated` to achieve that.  But after 0.6, zeppelin support shiro, I think it is more proper to take user as the first dimension (maybe remove note dimension later).\n\nBy default each user should run his own interpreter, I think this is the most often used scenarios.  For the scenario of `collaborative analysis`, I would suggest user to create a new interpreter with option `shared` and set permission on that interpreter to control who can share this interpreter across users.\n\nOverall, my concern is to reduce complexity. Since zeppelin is a tool and bridge between user and spark(other interpreter). The goal of zeppelin is to make the life of analyst easier, we should add less complexity as possible on the user facing UI. I know break compatibility is bad for user, but complexity is also very bad to users,  we should balance them. \n\n**Besides, I think we should think more deeply on the relationship between note, user and interpreter.**

I'd like to second the comment made by @zjffdu in #1265 on the interpreter options complexity. Btw, at the time of the introduction of the current interpreter modes, I already raised my worries on the complexity of those and honestly I am not convinced that I understand them fully (at least at first sight without digging into the code) and I fear that #1265 will make the situation still more complex. Taking back @zjffdu statement: _Besides, I think we should think more deeply on the relationship between note, user and interpreter._, and I would add also the relation with the SearchService, Helium... and any other services that Zeppelin uses (cc/ @jongyoul) - All these questions also binds to ZEPPELIN-1236 \"Multi-user notebook with user controls support\" created by @frosiere talking about shared dashboard...
