Hopefully Java will provide value types one day and that won't be a problem anymore. We can offer a higher-level interface for simpler functions and implement various casting operations for convenience, leaving the option to implement the low-level interface directly. Low-level functions could expose capabilities to define the supported types, which can in turn can be leveraged by query engines to optimize accordingly.\n\nGiven that the type of functions we are talking about operate on single values and not on rows, I don't think there is an immediate need to invert it. If that is what we nonetheless decide to do in the future, we can easily wrap existing functions to use the inversion mechanisms.\n\nMore immediately, I believe the most important thing to focus on is the interface to the user, so we don't have to change the query language too much. Maybe it makes more sense to provide a general `ExtractionDimensionSpec`, introducing a new `extractionFn` field and start deprecating the `dimExtractionFn` field. The result should still be thought of as a dimension though. That would remove the time-specific aspect from the query interface, and leave it to the query engine whether to support non-string values for columns other than time for now. This also opens up the ability to use all the existing dimExtraction Functions on the time column.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/76897100/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/76975353","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/1166#issuecomment-76975353","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1166","id":76975353,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2OTc1MzUz","user":{"login":"nishantmonu51","id":5023786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjM3ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5023786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51","html_url":"https://github.com/nishantmonu51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-03T16:09:27Z","updated_at":"2015-03-03T16:09:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"more log lines to give some more context - \n2015-02-28 00:15:00,121 INFO [task-runner-0] io.druid.segment.realtime.plumber.RealtimePlumber - Shutting down...\nabove log line was before the exception, i.e the task was complete and marked as being shutttingdown. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/76975353/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/76992252","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1159#issuecomment-76992252","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1159","id":76992252,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2OTkyMjUy","user":{"login":"drcrallen","id":8213081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMTMwODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8213081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen","html_url":"https://github.com/drcrallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-03T17:28:30Z","updated_at":"2015-03-03T17:28:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I agree with @xvrl on the low level aspect.\n\nIn a general sense, I think anything people may want to do can be accomplished with a javascript extraction function, but we are supplying optimized extractions as they become major use cases. \n\nI think eventually we want the `__time` dimension to be just another dimension, but that's a bit too big of an ask for this PR.\n\nRather than `ExtractionDimensionSpec` how would you feel about `EphemeralDimensionSpec`?

How they want to store data on their given underlying storage layer\n2. The best way to get at the data that is stored in the underlying storage layer \n\nThe reason for the jankiness in the current implementation is because it is mid-migration.  I agree that it needs to be improved, but I think that the implementation changes done here lead to less flexbility and a more difficult implementation.\n\nSpecifically, if we build an API around URIs, then we are essentially forcing everyone to come up with a mechanism of storing all of the data they might need/want to store inside of a URI, where working with just JSON objects and Java fields can be a lot simpler.\n\nIIRC, the specific problem that needed to be resolved in order to really do this section of code \"right\" was the DI layer.  Now that we have Guice injection integrated with Jackson, we should be able to do a really clean API that gives control over to the person integrating with whatever storage they are integrating with.\n\nSpecifically, I'd propose that the LoadSpec API should be\n\n```\npublic interface LoadSpec {\n  public void get(File outDir)\n}\n```\n\nThat is, you pass it a directory and it stores the files in there.  For our current implementations, the implementation of this loadSpec would essentially get the metadata as well as the relevant \"Puller\" injected and use those.  For future implementations (or things that are amenable to URI/URL semantics), there can be an implementation of this interface which specializes to utilizing URIs instead.\n\nThis \n1. Meets the original requirements of giving implementors full control over how they are storing things\n2. Works around issues with things like what if you want to retry a failure but don't have a Throwable?  With the API change made in the druid-api library, I now have to create a brand new Throwable, count on the outer logic to catch that and pass it off to my Predicate so that I can choose to retry.  That's leaking a lot in the abstraction.\n3. Completely eliminates the `DataSegment` argument from the loading interface and generifies it to something that should be usable for other storage types as well.\n\nWhat do you think?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/77025553/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/77032548","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1132#issuecomment-77032548","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1132","id":77032548,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MDMyNTQ4","user":{"login":"drcrallen","id":8213081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMTMwODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8213081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen","html_url":"https://github.com/drcrallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-03T20:55:33Z","updated_at":"2015-03-03T21:16:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"One reason I've been pushing back against the \"just give LoadSpec a directory\" approach is that at its core ends up being \"Let's not use a standard resource identification schema, let's make our own non-standard schema\" which is something I'd like to avoid (edit: unless there's a good reason a standard resource identification scheme won't work).\n\nThere are two parts of key points of data encoded in the loadSpec aside from the individual data identifier: 1. The filesystem, 2: the data container (gz, zip, etc)\n\nI understand the desire to have a simple interface, but with this approach I foresee 3 options:\n1. Each possible way of loading storing data has its own LoadSpec for each underlying file system (zip, gz, directory, tar.gz , whatever_other_format X hdfs, s3, file, cassandra)\n2. Each filesystem LoadSpec handles its own file loading in completely non-consistent ways (what we have now) with regards to retries and what formats are supported.\n3. Each possible Filesystem supplies a handle to the data container, and the OmniSegmentLoader figures out how to handle that container properly (what I have proposed)\n\nObviously I'm partial to 3, but I'm ok with going route 1 above, even though I think its unclean compared to 3, but am very against

Why is it bad to allow implementations to control the \"best\" way to store the data and subsequently retrieve it?\n\nAlso, why is it bad to allow, for example, HDFS to automatically retry things in its client while s3 doesn't implement that for us so we have to implement it ourselves?  If you have something that does retries on its own already and you implement retries on top of it, you are now multiplying out the retries.\n\nOn the question of using a URI, your argument is essentially that a URI is a standard thing, so therefore we should take all of the things in the JSON fields and map them into a URI and then write code to map out of that URI back into JSON fields.  Fwiw, JSON is also a standard and we already have stuff setup to serialize into and out of it.  The fact that the switch to URIs is the equivalent of just adding a new marshalling layer to the code is very clear from looking at the Cassandra implementation (one big glaring thing is the fact that you are choosing not to implement the URI-based method...).\n\nNote, I'm not against using URIs for things that already leverage URIs and I'm also not against having something that is intelligent about various storage formats at the end of those URIs.  I _am_ against making the assumption that everything must fit that mold forever and always.  If you adopt my interface, the Cassandra stuff can implement that and you can have all of your logic and figuring out of things hidden inside of another concrete implementation of LoadSpec that leverages URIs.  That's perfectly fine.

It forces the developer to address retries as an inherent desire for the data. 2. Retry loops at the OmniSegmentLoader level are still controllable by the Puller via the retry predicate.\n\nRegarding \"Why is it bad to allow implementations to control the \"best\" way to store the data and subsequently retrieve it?\" It goes back to consistency and _what level we want consistency to be enforced_. I was under the impression that there should be a _consistency in handling of data containers_, and the filesystem should be the pluggable portion.

Yes, I believe you are correct in capturing my thoughts on the matter.  A little bit of extra information is that I was thinking that exposing things in reusable code snippets and allowing the implementations to use them would be beneficial (hence the \"CompressionUtils\") in lowering the burden of repeated implementations.  \n\nThat said, I'm not against having an injection point that just implements an FS, allowing for the plugging that you are talking about.  I would prefer that both exist (and the docs could generally point people to the FS one and we reserve conversations on the mailing list for telling people about the other one).\n\nOne big reason for preferring both is that the way you have changed things right now, the change cannot be made backwards compatible.  I'm not sure if anyone is currently adding their own implementation as an extension (there was someone who implemented something on RackSpace that I'm not sure of the status of), but if someone is and they update their version of druid, all of a sudden their code won't work.\n\nIf we adjust the internal interfaces in the way I proposed, we can \n1. Have a backwards compatible implementation that uses the old interface\n2. Introduce your new interface (with a different name) and have an implementation that uses that\n3. Implement the Cassandra loader in terms of my proposed interface\n\nThis gives us the simplicity of just implementing an FS for the cases where that can be done easily, keeps an injection point for uses that don't lend themselves to URIs as well, and allows us to maintain backwards compatibility with old interface implementations, which can be deprecated and allow us a forward migration strategy.\n\nI.e. hopefully it's a win for everyone and it should clean up various parts of the code where you are checking for URIs and such (the URI implementation can just be pure URI, it doesn't have to be dirtied with legacy support.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/77193831/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/77200855","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1132#issuecomment-77200855","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1132","id":77200855,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MjAwODU1","user":{"login":"drcrallen","id":8213081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMTMwODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8213081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen","html_url":"https://github.com/drcrallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-04T17:13:56Z","updated_at":"2015-03-04T17:13:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@cheddar : I'm at mesos hackweek this week, so my time to modify this is limited, but I think unloading some of the brute work to a combination of FileUtils / CompressionUtils / RetryUtils is palatable to me. So the overall statement would be like this:\n1. LoadSpec would be a (hopefully thin) helper to make sure the right combination of FileUtils / CompressionUtils / RetryUtils and the correct Puller are called for the given load type. \n2. LoadSpec simply guarantees that a destination directory be passed in as a File type\n3. Any new file system for deep storage would need to make sure that a LoadSpec and the appropriate puller/pusher/killer was available\n4. There are no guarantees as to what types of file/data containers each filesystem can support. Support for containers exists in CompressionUtils.\n\nDoes that sound like a reasonable solution statement?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/77200855/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/77233757","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/694#issuecomment-77233757","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/694","id":77233757,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MjMzNzU3","user":{"login":"xvrl","id":815147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNTE0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/815147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl","html_url":"https://github.com/xvrl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-04T19:57:32Z","updated_at":"2015-03-04T19:57:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@cheddar I simplified it to use just another entry in the enum.

This optimization is not possible anymore, but in my opinion irrelevant, since that would previously require knowledge of the underlying values, or have the prior query use a dimension extraction function that did not modify the values.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/78314591/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/78317113","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1159#issuecomment-78317113","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1159","id":78317113,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4MzE3MTEz","user":{"login":"cheddar","id":216778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjc3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/216778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar","html_url":"https://github.com/cheddar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-11T17:49:15Z","updated_at":"2015-03-11T17:49:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Cool.
