I think all your observations are explainable, but they all point out usability issues that I think I can improve on.\r\n\r\n#### 1. Offsets\r\n\r\n`KAFKA_FIND` 'sticks' on its consumer offset.  It operates more like `KAFKA_GET` than `KAFKA_TAIL`.  This is how I described it in the docs.\r\n\r\n> Finds messages that satisfy a given filter expression. Subsequent calls will continue retrieving messages sequentially from the original offset.\r\n\r\nWhen you first run `KAFKA_FIND`, its consumer offset will not be set.  It will pick-up from the end of the topic.  When you run it again in the same session, it will continue filtering from those same offsets, rather than going to the end of the topic.  \r\n\r\nThe `kafka-console-consumer` tool always seeks to the end when it is run.  In your test its likely that `kafka-console-consumer` and `KAFKA_FIND` are at completely different offsets as you try to compare the two.\r\n\r\nI had actually already been working on a version of this that always seeks to the end and so behaves more like `KAFKA_TAIL` and `kafka-console-consumer`.\r\n\r\nPer the use case I described in the PR, I think 'seek to end' makes more sense.  You make a change on a live stream and want to see the immediate results.  If `KAFKA_TAIL` 'sticks' on an earlier offset, you're not going to see the most recent messages, which can be confusing for the user.\r\n\r\n#### 2. Timeouts\r\n\r\n> How long will this command listen until it times out (or is it based on number of messages read)? ...  Is this configurable?\r\n\r\nThe command will wait for up to 5 seconds, by default.  This can be adjusted by defining a global property `stellar.kafka.max.wait`.\r\n\r\n> Sometimes it returned an empty array immediately. \r\n\r\nIn this case, it probably pulled in messages from the topic, none of those messages matched your filter, and so returned an empty array to you.\r\n\r\nI probably need to look at the timeout logic under these conditions.  It should probably 'try harder' to find matching messages and not return immediately.  I'll take a look at this and see if it can be improved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/386286428/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/386352195","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1008#issuecomment-386352195","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1008","id":386352195,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NjM1MjE5NQ==","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-03T16:19:19Z","updated_at":"2018-05-03T16:19:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 Thanks for the upgrade and all the fixes.

What I was saying was that I think we should not adjust the VariableResolver infrastructure to update variables as the result of assignments, but rather return back the variable and the updated object.  For instance, in the `BaseStellarProcessor` class we have a `parse` method that returns the output of the expression.  I'd suggest we have a `parseExpression` and `parseAssignment` where the first acts as it does now and the second returns the variable name and the result.

Making a feature branch for stellar assignments and I'd +1 this into that branch and we can do the final PR in that branch\r\n3. pull back the scope of this PR and just have assignments supported in the parser without the unary operators.  This is what I was getting here in my comment before:\r\n\r\n> For instance, in the BaseStellarProcessor class we have a parse method that returns the output of  the expression. I'd suggest we have a parseExpression and parseAssignment where the first acts  as it does now and the second returns the variable name and the result.\r\n\r\nUltimately, I LOVE this PR and I don't want you to think that I'm poo-pooing it.  I think this is great work and I look forward to the feature being added.  It just seemed ALMOST done, but not quite enough to stand by itself in master because the gap may leave people confused.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/387836249/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/387840955","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/687#issuecomment-387840955","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/687","id":387840955,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4Nzg0MDk1NQ==","user":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-09T18:57:25Z","updated_at":"2018-05-09T18:57:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ok, so we are on the same page.

Everything in this plan worked.  I also added a step in each test to perform a search on alert fields and verified the metaalert was returned when appropriate (status is active and contained an alert with the matching field).  The request is similar to:\r\n```\r\ncurl -u user:password -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{\r\n  \"fields\": [\r\n    \"guid\",\"ip_dst_addr\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"from\": 0,\r\n  \"indices\": [\r\n    \"metaalert\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"query\": \"ip_dst_addr:192.168.66.121\",\r\n  \"size\": 10\r\n}' 'http://node1:8082/api/v1/search/search'\r\n```\r\n\r\nI did find a few cases that did not work.

The second metaalert is also still contained in the metaalerts field of the alert.\r\n\r\nThese seem like pretty unusual edge cases but I thought I should report them anyways since it could be indicative of a deeper issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/387890737/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/387893631","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1004#issuecomment-387893631","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1004","id":387893631,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4Nzg5MzYzMQ==","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-09T22:24:12Z","updated_at":"2018-05-09T22:24:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@sardell What is the status of this?

If you're okay with it, I think we make a another ticket against the parent ticket and resolve it separately.\r\n\r\nRe: the child alert's metaalerts field.  That field doesn't actually do anything and is an artifact of the denormalization process.  What happens there is that we just update the status of the metaalert, without updating denormalized alert's metaalert links (which are unused anyway and exist because it's more work and messy to update them on something we've already decided isn't active).\r\n\r\nHaving said that, this points to another issue further on. Check out https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/970/files#diff-b7359d01c3ffbed48b7fdaa2d32169e7R246.  The process of updating from inactive to active is slightly incomplete.\r\n\r\nSay we have these three steps:\r\n\r\n- Metaalert is updated to inactive\r\n- (Former) child alert is updated.\r\n- Metaalert is made active again.\r\n\r\nThe update will be missing from the metaalert.  We need to update the metaalert with the current state of any alerts (which we conveniently have because we needed to update them all anyway!). This is a problem with both ES and Solr (which shouldn't be surprising since that link is to the abstract DAO).  It also needs an associated test case.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/387918979/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/387919612","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/970#issuecomment-387919612","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/970","id":387919612,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NzkxOTYxMg==","user":{"login":"justinleet","id":5077341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzczNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5077341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet","html_url":"https://github.com/justinleet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-10T01:05:06Z","updated_at":"2018-05-10T01:05:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mmiklavc I'm also inclined to work on that fix against master, since it effects current ES metaalerts.
