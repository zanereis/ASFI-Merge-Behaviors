But the table operation does not have a good way to consistently get the table ID, catalogs such as `NessieCatalog` do not have this information. \r\n\r\nSo with the current encrypt API, what I think are 2 approaches to achieve one KEK per table use case:\r\n\r\n1. derive table ID based on `rawOutput.location()`, and as long as it follows the standard naming structure, we can get the namespace and table name and retrieve the KEK ID and generate a new DEK to encrypt a new metadata file.\r\n2. take `TableIdentifier` as an input of the `TableMetadataEncryptionManager` implementation, so that that implementation can reference this information in the encrypt method.\r\n\r\nThe encrypted DEK then can be stored in 2 ways:\r\n1. in an external system, for example you can have a very simple DynamoDB table that stores the key value pair of (metadataLocation, encryptedDek). Then decrypt method can easily decrypt based on that mapping information plus table ID derived from any of the 2 method above.\r\n2. as what you suggested, adding it into the historical metadata log list. \r\n\r\nHowever, I don't like the second approach personally due to the following reasons:\r\n1. this again places dependency on the table metadata. For each decryption, we need to call get table, check if it is the latest table metadata, and then choose to open table metadata or not to get the correct encrypted DEK. \r\n2. for every write of new table metadata, it needs to get externally managed KEK + encrypted DEK and store it as a historical log entry, which would require a lot of hooks in different places to achieve this goal and satisfy both single and double wrap encryption.\r\n\r\nWhat I hope is to have a clean cut between what keys are managed by Iceberg and what keys are completely managed externally, so that `TableMetadataEncryptionManager` is completely independent of `TableMetadata`, and `EncryptionManager` can fully depend on `TableMetadata`. \r\n\r\nIf you have a good suggestion for storing encrypted DEK approach 2, please let me know.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/817024583/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/817026027","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2428#issuecomment-817026027","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2428","id":817026027,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxNzAyNjAyNw==","user":{"login":"RussellSpitzer","id":413025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/413025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer","html_url":"https://github.com/RussellSpitzer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-09T23:33:30Z","updated_at":"2021-04-09T23:33:30Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@aokolnychyi  + @pan3793  Rebased and reshaded, if you could please take a look?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/817026027/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/817195511","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/2453#issuecomment-817195511","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2453","id":817195511,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxNzE5NTUxMQ==","user":{"login":"jun-he","id":12246263,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjQ2MjYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12246263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jun-he","html_url":"https://github.com/jun-he","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jun-he/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jun-he/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jun-he/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jun-he/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jun-he/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jun-he/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jun-he/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jun-he/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jun-he/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-10T20:04:55Z","updated_at":"2021-04-10T20:09:28Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@aokolnychyi That is for v1 table partition evolution.\r\n@RussellSpitzer  I will take a look.
