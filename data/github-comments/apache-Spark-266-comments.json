It looks like we re-assign to `collections.namedtuple`, but by then it's already too late since the user might have a reference to the original, non-wrapped `namedtuple` class.  Is there any easy way to patch the `namedtuple` object itself so that it injects the hack?

We can upgrade ourselves, but all that does is force our users downstream to have to upgrade (even if they aren't using ml stuff at all), causing the same annoying headache as breeze is causing us. I'd prefer to just remove the (now very small) use of scala-logging and just continue to use the slf4j API directly. The mian benefit of scala-logging is the use of compile time macro's for some performance gain, but we've never in the entire history of Spark had any performance issues related to logging.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50955760/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50955867","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1679#issuecomment-50955867","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1679","id":50955867,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwOTU1ODY3","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-02T06:51:03Z","updated_at":"2014-08-02T06:51:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA results for PR 1679:<br>\\- This patch PASSES unit tests.<br>\\- This patch merges cleanly<br>\\- This patch adds the following public classes (experimental):<br>class StorageStatus(val blockManagerId: BlockManagerId, val maxMem: Long) {<br><br>For more information see test ouptut:<br>https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/SparkPullRequestBuilder/17755/consoleFull\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50955867/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50955875","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1715#issuecomment-50955875","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1715","id":50955875,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwOTU1ODc1","user":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-02T06:51:41Z","updated_at":"2014-08-02T07:16:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Discussed with @pwendell offline, record a summary here:\n1.

uses `primaryResource` in various places, omitting primary resource makes the change hard to be correct in every corner case. Especially, in Python applications, primary resource is used to located the primary Python script. If we simply put it in `--py-files`, we'll have to add more constraints like \"Python primary resource put in `--py-files` must appear as the first file\", which can be rather unintuitive for users.\n\nInstead of omitting it, I'd suggest to add a new option `--primary` to specify the primary resource when `--` is used. Thus, the new option passing style looks something like:\n\n```\nbin/spark-submit --class Foo --primary user.jar --master local -- --arg1 --arg2\n```\n\nTo be more precise, the new mode consists of both `--primary` and `--`, and is used mutually exclusively with the positional primary resource mode. In this way, we needn't to change `SparkSubmit` and can also keep full downward compatibility.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50959924/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50959981","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1715#issuecomment-50959981","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1715","id":50959981,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwOTU5OTgx","user":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-02T10:54:49Z","updated_at":"2014-08-02T10:55:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"And, adding `--primary` also helps to retain support for specifying `spark-internal`, `spark-shell` and `pyspark-shell` as primary resource.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50959981/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50961153","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/332#issuecomment-50961153","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/332","id":50961153,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwOTYxMTUz","user":{"login":"witgo","id":302879,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjg3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/302879?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/witgo","html_url":"https://github.com/witgo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/witgo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/witgo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/witgo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/witgo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/witgo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/witgo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/witgo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/witgo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/witgo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-02T12:06:46Z","updated_at":"2014-08-02T12:06:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Jenkins, test this please.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50961153/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50961189","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/332#issuecomment-50961189","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/332","id":50961189,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwOTYxMTg5","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-02T12:09:01Z","updated_at":"2014-08-02T12:09:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA tests have started for PR 332.
