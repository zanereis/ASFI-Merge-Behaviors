My future plan is to extend for others. \r\n\r\nMy thought process is every-time we check for validations, the start snapshot should start from an ancestor of the branch.

In both the final insert data file and the records that I see in the debugger, the column with `bool=true` is passed in last. Because this is an upsert, the last row is the version that you end up with. I'm not sure why Flink is passing the rows in the wrong order, but it could be that the parser doesn't keep track of the order of rows in a `VALUES` clause.\r\n\r\nI also did a little exploration into what is different with the \"succeeds\" case. The significant change between the two in my testing was the use of `TO_DATE('2022-03-01')` instead of `DATE '2022-03-01'`. `TO_DATE` appears to trigger the rows getting out of order.\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this issue. Feel free to reopen if you think it is a problem with Iceberg somehow reordering the rows, but that seems unlikely given that these rows are coming from Flink and are identical when they come through the Iceberg API (the `TO_DATE` / `DATE` distinction is internal to Flink).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1173192373/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1173208986","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/5176#issuecomment-1173208986","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/5176","id":1173208986,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85F7b-a","user":{"login":"a49a","id":12015546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDE1NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12015546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/a49a","html_url":"https://github.com/a49a","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a49a/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a49a/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a49a/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a49a/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a49a/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a49a/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a49a/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a49a/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a49a/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-04T00:30:48Z","updated_at":"2022-07-04T00:30:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@kbendick I have updated in other Flink versions. @rdblue I have rebased.

In general the approach makes sense to me. However, when looking at the spark-runtime jar I noticed that there's a `git.properties` file with a bunch of information being added (looks like this actually comes from the `apache-arrow` lib). Here's the content of that file:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> #Generated by Git-Commit-Id-Plugin\r\n> #Sat Jan 29 05:11:45 UTC 2022\r\n> git.build.user.email=\r\n> git.build.host=Mac-1643432868411.local\r\n> git.dirty=true\r\n> git.remote.origin.url=https\\://github.com/apache/arrow\r\n> git.closest.tag.name=apache-arrow-7.0.0\r\n> git.commit.id.describe-short=apache-arrow-7.0.0-0-dirty\r\n> git.commit.user.email=szucs.krisztian@gmail.com\r\n> git.commit.time=29.01.2022 @ 00\\:08\\:24 UTC\r\n> git.commit.message.full=[Release] Update versions for 7.0.0\r\n> git.build.version=7.0.0\r\n> git.commit.message.short=[Release] Update versions for 7.0.0\r\n> git.commit.id.abbrev=e90472e\r\n> git.branch=e90472e35b40f58b17d408438bb8de1641bfe6ef\r\n> git.build.user.name=\r\n> git.closest.tag.commit.count=0\r\n> git.commit.id.describe=apache-arrow-7.0.0-0-ge90472e-dirty\r\n> git.commit.id=e90472e35b40f58b17d408438bb8de1641bfe6ef\r\n> git.tags=apache-arrow-7.0.0\r\n> git.build.time=29.01.2022 @ 05\\:11\\:45 UTC\r\n> git.commit.user.name=Krisztián Szűcs\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> I looked at https://github.com/n0mer/gradle-git-properties and was wondering whether we could actually use that plugin to generate a `git.properties` file for Iceberg. It seems the plugin lets you control which info goes into that file. Also note that we could include the Iceberg version via a `customProperty`.\r\n> \r\n> For completeness, here's how Arrow generates that file: https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/java/pom.xml#L249-L290\r\n\r\nThis is great. I'll try with this, as I can't find a clean way to deal with the additional file that's generated from the git tree.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1175249659/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1175252148","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/5132#issuecomment-1175252148","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/5132","id":1175252148,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85GDOy0","user":{"login":"szehon-ho","id":20555759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTU1NzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20555759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho","html_url":"https://github.com/szehon-ho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-05T16:27:33Z","updated_at":"2022-07-05T16:27:33Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Sure @huaxingao , thanks for spending the time on it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1175252148/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1175263073","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/5186#issuecomment-1175263073","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/5186","id":1175263073,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85GDRdh","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-05T16:38:18Z","updated_at":"2022-07-05T16:38:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@nastra, @kbendick, the Iceberg release process builds the binaries that are pushed to maven central from the source release tarball, where there is no git directory.

@nastra, @kbendick, the Iceberg release process builds the binaries that are pushed to maven central from the source release tarball, where there is no git directory. To use a plugin like this, we will need to make sure we have some process for generating the file and probably putting it in the source tree as part of the process, like how we [add the `version.txt` file](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/master/dev/source-release.sh#L90-L91).\r\n> \r\n> Also, I couldn't tell from a brief look at the README, can that plugin produce a `git.properties` file that is not in the root of the Jar? We want to make sure we don't have a name conflict, so I'd prefer to have `org/apache/iceberg/git.properties` or something similar.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure about the plugin. The way I'm doing it now definitely adds the file to the source tree (though I'd like to only do that for the release process).
