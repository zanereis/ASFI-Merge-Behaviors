I had planned at some point to work on this, and as often happens, got swamped. \n\nI've spoken to a few different companies that use `trigger_dag` and `TriggerDagRunOperator` and one common use-case is to handle high-volume event traffic. One company has thousands of Kafka consumers, each of which run a Sensing DAG that has a custom Kafka sensor. When an event arrives, each Sensing DAG executes a TriggerDagRunOperator which will result in work being done via the processing dag (e.g. https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/airflow-lesson-1-triggerdagrunoperator-siddharth-anand?trk=prof-post).\n\nHence, the cli is one part of the Trigger DAG use-case, the other being the TriggerDagRunOperator.\n\nHence, to make this work correctly, it seems that you should also ensure the TriggerDagRunOperator is passed an execution date. The one area I might be concerned about, mostly out of ignorance, is whether there will be any unique index violations because of some expectation of granularity of time.\n\nFinally, I had created 2 examples dags in `example_trigger_target_dag.py` and `example_trigger_controller_dag.py`. Feel free to add to those examples. Also, I don't recall if I added tests.. that might be good to add for your new functionality.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/221030368/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/221039971","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1531#issuecomment-221039971","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1531","id":221039971,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMTAzOTk3MQ==","user":{"login":"jeffreypicard","id":7770531,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3NzA1MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7770531?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreypicard","html_url":"https://github.com/jeffreypicard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreypicard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreypicard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreypicard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreypicard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreypicard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreypicard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreypicard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreypicard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreypicard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-23T17:34:00Z","updated_at":"2016-05-23T17:34:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@r39132 Thanks for the comments!

updated the existing PR to include a `BaseOperator` parameter of `render_params=False` and tested as appropriate in `get_template_context()`. Still trying to work out whether the natural home of this should be `render_templates()` or `get_template_context()`.\n\nFor context sake, here is an example operator from one of my DAGs. The `config` and `steps` params are long YAML files which define our EMR clusters and most of these are very similar hence the need to parameterise. Some of the values passed in via the parameters are dynamic and created from other TaskInstances.\n\n``` python\ncreate_cluster = EmrSensor(\n    config='resources/emr/cluster/config.yaml',\n    steps='resources/emr/steps/steps.yaml',\n    params={\n        'db_host': \"{{ task_instance.xcom_pull(task_ids='create_db') }}\",\n        'year': \"{{ (execution_date - macros.timedelta(days=18)).year }}\",\n        'month': \"{{ (execution_date - macros.timedelta(days=18)).month }}\"\n    },\n    task_id='create_cluster',\n    dag=dag,\n)\n```\n\nSo if implemented in  `render_templates()`` are you thinking of something like this (not tested as yet)...?\n\n``` python\n    def render_templates(self):\n        task = self.task\n        jinja_context = self.get_template_context()\n        if hasattr(self, 'task') and hasattr(self.task, 'dag'):\n            if self.task.dag.user_defined_macros:\n                jinja_context.update(\n                    self.task.dag.user_defined_macros)\n\n        rt = self.task.render_template  # shortcut to method\n        if self.render_params:\n            jinja_context['params'] = rt('params', jinja_context['params'], jinja_context)\n\n        for attr in task.__class__.template_fields:\n            content = getattr(task, attr)\n            if content:\n                rendered_content = rt(attr, content, jinja_context)\n                setattr(task, attr, rendered_content)\n\n```\n\nI guess it comes down to whether you view that the rendered params are special cases of normal templated variables or whether they are actually now the context for rendering - this was my original view, but after writing out what I think the updated render_templates would look like, it's a little more six of one and half a dozen of the other now. I'm happy to resubmit the PR in whichever form seems best...\n\nNB: It seems that `get_template_context()` is already being called twice during the execution of `TaskInstance.run()`. If there is a worry about performance of the templating then perhaps we should make `render_templates()` accept an optional context to avoid the double call, something like...\n\n``` python\n        if not mark_success:\n            context = self.get_template_context()\n\n            task_copy = copy.copy(task)\n            self.task = task_copy\n\n            def signal_handler(signum, frame):\n                '''Setting kill signal handler'''\n                logging.error(\"Killing subprocess\")\n                task_copy.on_kill()\n                raise AirflowException(\"Task received SIGTERM signal\")\n            signal.signal(signal.SIGTERM, signal_handler)\n\n            self.render_templates(context=context)\n\n    ...\n\n    def render_templates(self, context=None):\n        task = self.task\n        jinja_context = context or self.get_template_context()\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/221320830/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/221321238","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1488#issuecomment-221321238","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1488","id":221321238,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMTMyMTIzOA==","user":{"login":"landscape-bot","id":10010231,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDEwMjMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10010231?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/landscape-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-24T16:07:20Z","updated_at":"2016-05-24T16:07:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[![Code
