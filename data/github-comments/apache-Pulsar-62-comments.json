Should proxyRoles be mandatory when we use proxy?\r\n\r\nI think yes, as we give the proxy special abilities to spoof identity and this is a very powerful ability. However, my thinking on this is 100% TLS auth focussed, so I don't know how this interacts with athenz. Also, if auth is completely off between the proxy and broker, this would be unnecessary, though I don't know if this is currently the case.\r\n\r\nBut it would be good to get some other opinions. @merlimat @jai1 @joefk @massakam @sijie \r\n\r\n> Is a role in proxyRoles not allowed to behave as a \"normal\" client?\r\n\r\nAlso yes, modulo other opinions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/430121994/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/430291385","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/2752#issuecomment-430291385","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/2752","id":430291385,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMDI5MTM4NQ==","user":{"login":"srkukarni","id":2530234,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzAyMzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2530234?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni","html_url":"https://github.com/srkukarni","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-16T15:50:40Z","updated_at":"2018-10-16T15:50:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"run integration tests","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/430291385/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
