I have a couple of clarification questions about the expected behavior of the timeouts. Sorry if I misunderstood something.\r\n\r\n1. The logic handles only the retries? What about canceling the reads that are taking longer than the deadline?\r\n   For example:\r\n   - If I set a context deadline of 1 second and `i/o timeout` appears, before that, a read will be retried. Correct?\r\n   - If the context deadline set to 1 second, but read takes 5 seconds, it will not be canceled after 1 second and will not be retried later. Correct?\r\n2. Is the logic applied only to the `ReadMessageBegin`? What about `Read` and `ReadMessageEnd`?\r\n   For example:\r\n    - Context deadline is set to 5 seconds and `i/o timeout` happens after 1 second of `ReadMessageBegin`, so it will be retried. Right?\r\n    - Context deadline is set to 5 seconds, and `ReadMessageBegin` succeeds in 1 second, but the further `Read` fails with the `i/o timeout` in 1 more second (so 3 seconds left until the deadline). Will it be retried?\r\n3. This logic was added to the `TBinaryProtocol`, `TCompactProtocol`, `THeaderProtocol` but not to the `TJSONProtocol`, right?\r\n\r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/790599343/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/790775860","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/2181#issuecomment-790775860","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2181","id":790775860,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5MDc3NTg2MA==","user":{"login":"fishy","id":78183,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MTgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/78183?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy","html_url":"https://github.com/fishy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-04T17:09:04Z","updated_at":"2021-03-04T17:09:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@Trane9991 \r\n\r\n1. Yes for both\r\n2. This is because the way the library/framework works, you would only get io timeouts on the first reads (`ReadMessageBegin`). For client side write (server side read), if you look at `TStandardClient`'s implementation, we always call `WriteMessageBegin`, `Write`, `WriteMessageEnd`, `Flush` without delays between them (https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/a8c041dd580ff37f3e32b0eaafed542f496d5d58/lib/go/thrift/client.go#L44-L53). For server side write (client side read), it's the same in the compiler generated `Process` functions. The only \"delay\" that could cause io timeouts are the delaye before calling `WriteMessageBegin`. For server writes those delays are just the actual handler handling the request and generating the response. I described that in the [jira ticket](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/THRIFT-5233).\r\n3.

We should still do all the `cd fuzz && go mod edit` under the `test` directory because that's where they are actually used. Sorry about my misleading suggestion.\r\n\r\nActually I think if you just add a unit test under `test` directory to import from `fuzz`, we do not need to do all the `go mod edit` under `fuzz`. we either do them under `test` or not need to do them at all. The test itself passes means that the building of `fuzz` is working, so we do not need to build `fuzz`.\r\n\r\nBut if you don't want to add and just want to make sure that the building of `fuzz` works, then what you are doing right now should work. I'm not super familiar with automake so I'm not sure how is it supposed to generate the `all` target from `Makefile.am`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/802148093/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/802812336","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/2351#issuecomment-802812336","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2351","id":802812336,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwMjgxMjMzNg==","user":{"login":"catenacyber","id":35799796,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5Nzk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35799796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/catenacyber","html_url":"https://github.com/catenacyber","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catenacyber/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catenacyber/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catenacyber/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catenacyber/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catenacyber/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catenacyber/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catenacyber/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catenacyber/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catenacyber/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-19T12:53:27Z","updated_at":"2021-03-19T12:53:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":">  I'm not super familiar with automake so I'm not sure how is it supposed to generate the all target from Makefile.am.\r\n\r\nFound I needed to make the `SUBDIRS += fuzz` conditional\r\nI also added a golang test, let's see what CI thinks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/802812336/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/802979450","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/2351#issuecomment-802979450","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2351","id":802979450,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwMjk3OTQ1MA==","user":{"login":"fishy","id":78183,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MTgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/78183?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy","html_url":"https://github.com/fishy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-19T17:03:12Z","updated_at":"2021-03-19T17:03:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The go code/test part looks good to me.

It's just a quote-delimited string.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/810444361/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/810519551","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/2366#issuecomment-810519551","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2366","id":810519551,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxMDUxOTU1MQ==","user":{"login":"aaronstgeorge-wf","id":15633954,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjMzOTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15633954?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronstgeorge-wf","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronstgeorge-wf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronstgeorge-wf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronstgeorge-wf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronstgeorge-wf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronstgeorge-wf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronstgeorge-wf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronstgeorge-wf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronstgeorge-wf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronstgeorge-wf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronstgeorge-wf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-30T19:26:25Z","updated_at":"2021-03-30T19:31:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think we we got off on the wrong foot here.
