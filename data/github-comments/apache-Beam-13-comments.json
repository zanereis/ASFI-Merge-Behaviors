I can fix them now, but if we remove them anyways because most stuff is now covered by the RunnableOnService tests then I'd rather not do it.\n\nThis is the list of tests that we currently have for the batch runner:\n\n```\nAvroITCase\nFlattenizeITCase\nFlinkRunnerRegistrarTest\nJoinExamplesITCase\nMaybeEmptyTestITCase\nParDoMultiOutputITCase\nPipelineOptionsTest\nReadSourceITCase\nRemoveDuplicatesEmptyITCase\nRemoveDuplicatesITCase\nSideInputITCase\nTfIdfITCase\nWordCountITCase\nWordCountJoin2ITCase\nWordCountJoin3ITCase\nWriteSinkITCase\n```\n\nI would say that we only have to keep these:\n\n```\nFlinkRunnerRegistrarTest\nFlinkTestPipeline\nPipelineOptionsTest\nReadSourceITCase\nWriteSinkITCase\n```\n\nThese would basically test that source/sink integration and reading/writing from/to the outside world are correct. (The `RunnableOnTest` tests never have a sink, they always verify using `PAssert`, if I'm not mistaken) And also the plumbing of the runner and the pipeline options is verified. All the other stuff is already tests more thoroughly by the `RunnableOnService` tests.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/219029873/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/219099040","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/291#issuecomment-219099040","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/291","id":219099040,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxOTA5OTA0MA==","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-13T16:53:45Z","updated_at":"2016-05-13T16:53:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I believe this is superseded by #328.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/219099040/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/219109968","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/328#issuecomment-219109968","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/328","id":219109968,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxOTEwOTk2OA==","user":{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-13T17:37:30Z","updated_at":"2016-05-13T17:37:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It seems there is still a small problem that leads to one test failing, I have not yet pinpointed it.
