mind, @kyotoYaho ! I think the problem is that conditions are lost in finally block. We can either rebuild the conditions or use the cached value.\r\n\r\n- The former solution will add complicated condition checks in the final block. These checks are difficult to understand and test, and may be buggy in the future when features are addd or improvements are made. \r\n- The latter will visit the cache one more time and will reduce the query performance.\r\n\r\nUsing \"try .. finally\" is more elegant, but some code refactoring is needed to keep it clean, I think. To get out of the dilemma, we can treat this PR as a quick bug-fix, and discuss the refactoring in another issue. \r\n\r\nI will revert the commit. Thanks for the
