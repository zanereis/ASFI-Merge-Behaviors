I'm not sure about the intention of the API generally, but the `TestRunner#run()` method will call `@OnUnscheduled` callbacks immediately after the first call to `Processor#onTrigger()`.

I think it would forward an empty flow file since nothing would have been written to it.  Is that what you want?  Such a case seems like a FAILURE to me.\n- Consider removing the incompatible relationship and simply adding an attribute to the success flow file which lists the reasons or add an attribute per reason for difficulty converting the original.  If you will keep the incompatible relationship then I’d recommend sending it a clone of the original item and then adding the relationship.  That would make troubleshooting or analysis of that object much easier.  In any case be very careful about how large these attributes could become.  If you’re storing a series of stack traces this could become unwieldy and memory inefficient really fast.\n\nConvertJSONToAvro\n- Line 160 should use parameters passed in via object[] rather than string concatenation.\n- Same comments as Convert CSV to Avro.\n\nFailureTracker\n- This class is a cool idea.  My concern with it is that it appears to store all the raw reasons which could be quite significant in large files with _many_ thousands of lines.  This could create issues with the heap, cause excessive GC, etc.  Consider refactoring this class to both immediately store the summarized representation and to bound the total number of reasons it will store.  It can just ignore additional errors as they arrive.  This will allow it to behave well in terms of memory consumption even in the presence of massive failures as everything will be bounded.\n\nThanks\nJoe\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/116186741/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/116190999","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/51#issuecomment-116190999","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/51","id":116190999,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNjE5MDk5OQ==","user":{"login":"joewitt","id":3057465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTc0NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3057465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt","html_url":"https://github.com/joewitt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-28T04:21:20Z","updated_at":"2015-06-28T04:21:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Should we move ahead to Flume 1.6.0 now?

I reviewed all bundled dependencies and they all appear to be legit so doing this will be tedious but not problematic.  I am happy to do this for you.  There are lots of good examples of how to do this in the other nar bundles and we’ve augmented ASF guidance for handling licensing here; http://nifi.incubator.apache.org/licensing-guide.html\n\nThe various Flume processors within the Nar appear to have a significant version conflict for Netty.  Ranging from wanting 3.5.x to 3.8.x of Netty.  Unclear if this is important so just bringing to your attention.\n\nThe bundled dependencies include a rather old version of Jetty.  I am not clear if this will conflict with the Jetty libraries we use and a quick scan of our docs suggests we don’t point out the limitations of Nar class loader isolation (will make a ticket).  You may have no action here just bringing it to your attention.\n\nRecommend renaming the processors to ‘ExecuteFlumeSource’ and ‘ExecuteFlumeSink’.  The naming structure we try to follow is generally verb-subject.  I did not find that we had this documented (will make a ticket).\n\nThis processor is a perfect case for providing some ‘additional details’ documentation so that when someone looks up the usage it will show them how to configure a fully working example.  http://nifi.incubator.apache.org/docs/nifi-docs/html/developer-guide.html#advanced-documentation\n\nIs there any service provider construct or similar mechanism whereby we could provide a dropdown of identified sources and sinks so the user doesn’t have to type them by hand?  Not critical just curious.  Given that the other property is pasting of a flume properties section this is already pretty ‘developer heavy’ anyway so it isn’t necessary.  But if possible it could be a nice convenience to offer.\n\nFlumeSinkProcessor: I think because channel.setSession(…) is being called as it is during the onTrigger method this means the processor needs to run serially.  If multiple threads are running then the channel’s session would get overwritten potentially creating some very interesting threading issues most likely.  Is marking it is as serial only going to be sufficient?  We have an annotation for that if so which will have the framework ensure it only gets a single thread for the processor.  I think a similar issue is present on FlumeSourceProc.\n\nIf you happen to have a template of a flow that can be used to test/demonstrate its function that would be a great thing to have.  If so please add to the JIRA.\n\nLooking forward to seeing this merged in.  Let me know if you’d like to address these or discuss them further.\n\nThanks\nJoe\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/116190999/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/116191838","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/51#issuecomment-116191838","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/51","id":116191838,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNjE5MTgzOA==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-28T04:43:51Z","updated_at":"2015-06-28T04:43:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Is there any service provider construct or similar mechanism whereby we could provide a dropdown of identified sources and sinks\n\nI think this is primarily intended to allow people to use their current Flume config inside of NiFi and pave the way for more seamless integration as a next step.

We'll work with you to get this promptly merged.  Here are some findings of an initial review:\n- Please run the build with 'mvn clean install -Pcontrib-check'.  You'll find there many formatting issues.  It appears that many of the lines have had extraneous newlines and tabs added to them.  Please take a look and tweak until the contrib check runs cleanly and that you still think the code looks good.\n- There do not appear to be any unit tests for the processor itself.  I do see a couple unit tests for the converter class/logic which is good but it is best to also have a test or two, particularly for something that seems as easily tested as this one is.  You can find lots of examples throughout the codebase including in this kite bundle.\n- The conversion routines for Long, Double, Float, etc.. you really should consider adding regex checks before calling those methods.  Since the Java methods use exception handling for flow control the performance penalty can be extremely severe compared to simply doing a regex check beforehand.  In the event that the data is clean you'll be good to go but when it isn't the impact to the system as a whole can be dramatic.  Given the nature of this sort of processor that is probably something to tackle right away.\n- This processor is probably a great candidate to use the 'Advanced Documentation' feature.  Users will need this to understand the schema/syntax of the conversion configuration and examples would go a long way for that.  You can see more about this here http://nifi.incubator.apache.org/docs/nifi-docs/html/developer-guide.html#advanced-documentation and there are some examples in the existing standard processors to consider.\n- There are a couple of copy/paste errors in the processor from the CSV/Avro converter.  Look for these \"Failed to convert {}/{} records from CSV to Avro\" and \"Failed to convert {}/{} records from CSV to Avro\"\n\nI realize this looks like a lot of stuff but it should be pretty easy to address and is a good first step.  If you have any questions on it just let us know.\n\nThanks\nJoe\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/119416855/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/120740492","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/51#issuecomment-120740492","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/51","id":120740492,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyMDc0MDQ5Mg==","user":{"login":"joey","id":249392,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTM5Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/249392?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joey","html_url":"https://github.com/joey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-12T16:55:51Z","updated_at":"2015-07-12T16:55:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sorry for the delay, I've been looking at the threading model and I'm convinced that for the first version we should mark the processors as serial only. \n\nThis matches the behavior of \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/120740492/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/120740843","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/51#issuecomment-120740843","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/51","id":120740843,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyMDc0MDg0Mw==","user":{"login":"joey","id":249392,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTM5Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/249392?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joey","html_url":"https://github.com/joey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-12T17:03:54Z","updated_at":"2015-07-12T17:03:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sorry, hit comment by accident. \n\nThis matches the behavior of Flume so there's no loss in functionality for the user. In fact a number of sinks/sources have config parameters to run threads internally for parallelism so users can still take advantage of those. Finally, I reviewed some Flume code and I'm nervous about finding subtle concurrency issues with trying to run multi-threaded sinks/sources. \n\nIf performance is a real concern as users start working with it, we can work on adding it in the future.\n\nI should have an updated PR with the other comments addressed later today. \n\nAs far as a drop down of sources/sinks go, Flume has no service loader mechanism so I can't do it generally. I could populate a combo box with the sources/sinks we ship and users could type in a class if they added one after the fact. \n\nThere is no API for introspecting config parameters so we'll have to keep that a copy/paste experience.

Should be easy to write up a full-regex version if we decide we want that.\n- The code for sending just the failed records down the error relationship got a little nasty. It calls session.write on a copy of the incoming flowfile, then completely ignores that flowfile and uses the failed records it collected during the first pass through the input data.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/120950010/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/120964542","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/51#issuecomment-120964542","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/51","id":120964542,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyMDk2NDU0Mg==","user":{"login":"joey","id":249392,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTM5Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/249392?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joey","html_url":"https://github.com/joey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-13T15:18:38Z","updated_at":"2015-07-13T15:18:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"You're right, it's a tedious process :) I think the Yetus project (being spun out of Hadoop) is planning to take a stab at having programatic tools for rolling up NOTICES to hopefully make this less tedious.\n\nI didn't roll up the NOTICES/LICENSE file to the nifi-assembly.

Thanks again for sticking with it and contributing.  I made one comment inline.\n\nI have one other comment that I'd like to get others feedback on:\nThis processor attempts to delete data from Amazon S3.  I could see there being a case for three scenarios, and three relationships out of the processor\n1) the data is found in S3, and deleted(success)\n2) the data is not found in S3, and therefore not deleted(not found)\n3) there was some issue communicating with S3 and the object could not be deleted(failure)\n\nBasically, you would be adding a \"not found\" relationship, and routing FlowFiles there when you they are not found in S3 before you attempt to delete them.  The reason being, you allow the user of your processor the opportunity to treat \"not found\" situations differently from \"failure\" situations.\n\nI tried to find other cases like this in the NiFi processor marketplace, but I couldn't.  (https://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/master/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-aws-bundle/nifi-aws-processors/src/main/java/org/apache/nifi/processors/aws/sqs/DeleteSQS.java) is the only \"delete\" processor I see, and it doesn't behave the way I am describing.\n\n@markap14 @mcgilman @joewitt thoughts?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/136828624/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/136924301","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/80#issuecomment-136924301","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/80","id":136924301,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNjkyNDMwMQ==","user":{"login":"yu-iskw","id":1523515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjM1MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1523515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu-iskw","html_url":"https://github.com/yu-iskw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu-iskw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu-iskw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu-iskw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu-iskw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu-iskw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu-iskw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu-iskw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu-iskw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu-iskw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-02T03:22:07Z","updated_at":"2015-09-02T03:22:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@danbress thank you for the comment.

In that case I need to read the item file only once. I created a workflow, which grabs the item file, creates a flow file for each item (each line), where the ItemId is added as a custom flow file attribute and puts those flow files into the distributed cache, using the PutDistributedMapCache processor. The cache key is the custom ItemId attribute, and the metadata is the cache value. During the event file enrichment I use this item catalogue cache to look for an ItemId and get e.g. the title. \n\n(My workflow is not so simple, because I use JSON conversion, and additional processors as well)\n\nThe DetectDuplicate was not an appropriate processor for me, because (as it names suggests) it is used for duplicate detection and caches a custom flow file attribute, not the flow file content.\n\nI hope I was able to highlight my rationality behind this new processor  :-)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/142654373/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/142689586","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/92#issuecomment-142689586","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/92","id":142689586,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MjY4OTU4Ng==","user":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-23T18:28:33Z","updated_at":"2015-09-23T18:28:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"OK so to make sure that I am understanding the use case.

Otherwise, in order to add new methods to the ExtendedDistributedMapCacheClient we would need to create yet another interface that extends that one. This is all done because we consider the Standard Services API to be \"public interfaces\" so that once they are out there, we have no idea who has implemented them. As a result, if we change them, even if we update all of the code in Apache NiFi, we may be breaking someone else's \"private\" implementation.\n\nIn theory, though, this will become a lot less painful once we move to 1.0.0 because I believe the intent is to move to Java 8, which means that we can include default implementations in the interfaces. As a result, we could potentially add new methods to interfaces as long as they can be implemented using existing methods.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/144378199/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/144703463","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/92#issuecomment-144703463","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/92","id":144703463,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NDcwMzQ2Mw==","user":{"login":"joemeszaros","id":1064211,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjQyMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1064211?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joemeszaros","html_url":"https://github.com/joemeszaros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joemeszaros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joemeszaros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joemeszaros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joemeszaros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joemeszaros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joemeszaros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joemeszaros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joemeszaros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joemeszaros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-01T11:37:54Z","updated_at":"2015-10-01T16:43:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@markap14  I think your answer is related to an other pull request #94 (NIFI-989).
