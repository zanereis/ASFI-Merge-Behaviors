sounds reasonable, we have to take a bit of time to think about the implications. \n\nEffectively it could also be implemented as an externally triggered DAG where the external trigger cares only about not having a current active DagRun. If that's what you need though it's nice to let the scheduler take care of it and not have to write and manage your own external trigger.\n\nI think it's compatible with `depends_on_past=True` on \"dealbreaker\" task. Where if you want the flow to stop on error you can hook that up using the existing methodology.\n\nIt seems like it would be as easy as the code you sketched here.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/213643201/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/213856638","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1378#issuecomment-213856638","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1378","id":213856638,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMzg1NjYzOA==","user":{"login":"syvineckruyk","id":335167,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNTE2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/335167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/syvineckruyk","html_url":"https://github.com/syvineckruyk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syvineckruyk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syvineckruyk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syvineckruyk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syvineckruyk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syvineckruyk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syvineckruyk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syvineckruyk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syvineckruyk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syvineckruyk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-24T00:11:08Z","updated_at":"2016-04-24T00:11:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jlowin so far on this branch I have found a couple of issues. `depends_on_past=True` does not appear to be respected.

A few minutes ago when we crossed over to April 24th UTC... that is when the task-instances that should not have been kicked off began running. The schedule of those tasks was not midnight ... it was actually for 12 hours from then at 12pm.

The fix I put in place was that Scheduler kept track of tasks it submitted to the executor, and only tried to run _those_ tasks if they became queued. That way, the queued subdag tasks were left alone and Backfill handled them without interference. The problem is that folks often run Scheduler with the `--num_runs` parameter, which makes Scheduler restart periodically. When Scheduler restarts, it has no way to know what tasks it submitted before it quit, and so those tasks remain queued forever. The bug could occur less commonly if Scheduler were to quit for any other reason while tasks were queued.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/213987281/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/214028287","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1382#issuecomment-214028287","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1382","id":214028287,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNDAyODI4Nw==","user":{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-24T19:53:10Z","updated_at":"2016-04-24T19:53:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"ping @jbrownlucid \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/214028287/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/214046990","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1392#issuecomment-214046990","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1392","id":214046990,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNDA0Njk5MA==","user":{"login":"sdiazb","id":2188742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxODg3NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2188742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdiazb","html_url":"https://github.com/sdiazb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdiazb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdiazb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdiazb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdiazb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdiazb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdiazb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdiazb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdiazb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdiazb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-24T22:17:13Z","updated_at":"2016-04-24T22:17:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Great!

@aadim , thanks for being the thorough with your description. It allowed my to dive in properly.\n\nOn why the scheduler starts the job 2016-04-24T00:00:00 (I am _not_ saying it is correct, I dont think it is). This is because the tasks in the DAG also get as start date \"2016-04-24\" and this is used to set the next_run_date in models.py:\n\n```\n                    # set start_date based on tasks\n                    task_start_dates = [t.start_date for t in dag.tasks]\n                    if task_start_dates:\n                        next_run_date = min(task_start_dates)\n                    else:\n                        next_run_date = None\n                    logging.info(\"Set next run date to {} based on task_start_date\".format(next_run_date))\n```\n\nAt the moment I, personally, think that next_run_date should be set to min(task_start_dates) + schedule_interval.

It is also not marked running. I will dive in a little further now with dates in the future.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/214261859/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/214367090","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1382#issuecomment-214367090","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1382","id":214367090,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNDM2NzA5MA==","user":{"login":"landscape-bot","id":10010231,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDEwMjMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10010231?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/landscape-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-25T14:44:58Z","updated_at":"2016-04-25T14:44:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[![Code

Thanks.\n\nI agree it could be externally triggered if that is preferable...  I'd probably do it by having my DAG end with a node that fires the DAG again, effectively making it infinitely recursive (assuming it keeps on succeeding).  I believe I can do that on my own without needing to make any changes in core, so if that's the preferred method just let me know.\n\nActually, that might even be simpler.  The only downside I can see to it is that nothing in the way the job is scheduled would tell someone how it is being triggered.  They'd have to know about my special end-node on the DAG.

Therefore I suspect that this chain of events could happen:\n1. scheduler happily runs tasks in the DAG up until it reaches the \"manual\" task\n2. when the manual task is the only one left, the scheduler will think the DAG is deadlocked and mark the run (but not the task) as failed\n3. later, the user comes along and triggers the manual task in the GUI \n4. the user is surprised that the manual tasks' downstream tasks don't run, but it's because the scheduler thinks the dagrun failed.\n\nI think this might require a new task state (as in SUCCESS, FAILED, QUEUED) since it doesn't fit the current expectations of how tasks behave?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/214747455/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/214749184","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1432#issuecomment-214749184","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1432","id":214749184,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNDc0OTE4NA==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-26T13:42:23Z","updated_at":"2016-04-26T13:42:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[![Coverage
