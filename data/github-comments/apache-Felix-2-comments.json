As you might as well figured out, I’m not all that skillful using GitHub. I thought I could just edit the file an do a select all, and paste, but I see that’s not the case in GitHub. A search on the internet reveals I not the only one confused by that.\n\n \n\nI been using the code with the changes and it has been pretty solid.  As far as native code testing, I’ve verified that source code is copied out of the bundle and stored in the directory for the BundleRevison and that the proper directory paths has been added to the PathClassLoader.   I’ve not actually invoked a native library method;  that mechanism should however work as it has in the past.  I will sometime in the future actually call a native library method and verify the full process.
