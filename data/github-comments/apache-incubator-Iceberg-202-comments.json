I am still debating what should be a correct fix for MoR, though. The problem is that `MergeRows` can indeed produce nullable values for what's considered non-nullable columns if we have a delete action in MoR. For deleted rows in MoR, we will nullify all attributes except row ID and metadata columns. Yes, those delete rows will not be passed to the data source but the node can produce nulls. The current solution works because there is no code after `MergeRows` but if there was, we can be in trouble.\r\n\r\nLet me think a bit more.

So here are my thoughts:\r\n\r\n> Following this line of thought, we should probably also address the question of whether the SQL text should be validated in Iceberg/the API implementation, or validation is left to the enclosing engine. If it is validated in Iceberg/the API implementation, then Iceberg/implementation needs to understand the dialects as well. If it is left to the enclosing engine, there is the risk of passing an invalid view text.\r\n\r\nYes, after some thought, my thinking is in the long run the Iceberg View format should enforce correctness and semantic equality between the different representations. However, I think for an initial implementation though it suffices to just put it on the engine or translation layer to validate. Later on, validation can be implemented within the View API. \r\n\r\n>By the way, I believe adding new representations (e.g., dialects) of semantically equivalent views (case 2 above) should not increment the view version. Do you agree? It seems this might result in having to distinguish between view representations that only add a dialect and preserve the semantics and view representations that change the semantics.\r\n\r\nSo view versions in my mind should represent every single change to the view, similar to there's a new table metadata version regardless of if there is a new snapshot or not. Another argument is that view version should only increment for semantic or schema changes in the view (which if i'm not mistaken is what you're suggesting), but I think the mental model would be hard to grasp here when people try and compare with Iceberg table specification.\r\n\r\n Also for an initial implementation if we don't have any validation controls, then I think it becomes necessary to increment on any new version representations which are updated, so that people can rollback the view if it's in a state they do not like.\r\n \r\n I'm on board with having a separated updateViewRepresentations which has a \"merge\" like semantic for updating view representations (either replacing existing ones of the same type and dialect OR if non-existing, create the new representation)\r\n \r\n Thoughts @jzhuge @danielcweeks ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1260144084/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1260144441","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/5862#issuecomment-1260144441","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/5862","id":1260144441,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85LHEc5","user":{"login":"rizaon","id":6033430,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMzM0MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6033430?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rizaon","html_url":"https://github.com/rizaon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rizaon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rizaon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rizaon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rizaon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rizaon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rizaon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rizaon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rizaon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rizaon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-27T22:35:50Z","updated_at":"2022-09-27T22:35:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Got the following error:\r\n> Error: eckstyle] [ERROR] /home/runner/work/iceberg/iceberg/core/src/test/java/org/apache/iceberg/TestManifestCaching.java:24:1: Use org.apache.iceberg.relocated.* classes from bundled-guava module instead.

Thank you @singhpk234! - sorry will share plans next time.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16835507/193121736-07b69f0c-5b51-4566-8276-bf617d1a30b5.png)\r\n\r\nTwo more questions\r\n- Why is `write.delete.distribution-mode=hash` by default? Seems like `write.delete.distribution-mode=none` is safer?\r\n- Is the sort necessary considering the files should already be sorted? \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1262718690/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1262744269","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/5875#issuecomment-1262744269","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/5875","id":1262744269,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85LQ_LN","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-29T19:54:06Z","updated_at":"2022-09-29T19:54:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks good to me.
