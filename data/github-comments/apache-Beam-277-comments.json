would be optimal, and in general I really like the idea of capturing the stack trace of transform application and using it in all error messages. We already do this in PAssert, but it can be applied much more widely - e.g. errors during coder inference, validation errors, some runtime errors etc.\r\n\r\nI suspect that implementing that can have some unexpected stumbling blocks, so I would recommend to start with a simpler improvement - just make the error message clearly say that the fix is to specify name in apply().\r\n\r\nHowever, if you're willing to drive an effort to use application stack traces in more places in Beam, starting with a discussion on the mailing list - that would be a wonderful contribution and I'd be happy to review it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/347341595/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/347342299","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/4139#issuecomment-347342299","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4139","id":347342299,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NzM0MjI5OQ==","user":{"login":"jkff","id":343722,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MzcyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/343722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff","html_url":"https://github.com/jkff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-27T21:58:01Z","updated_at":"2017-11-27T21:58:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"retest
