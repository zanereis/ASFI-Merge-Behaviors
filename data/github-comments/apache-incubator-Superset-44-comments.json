The application stores an sqlite db by default at ~/.superset/superset.db. My home directory is an NFS partition which sqlite doesn't play nice due to some locking mechanism. My fix is to create superset_config.py in /opt/logs/sandbox/airbnb/, and define this variable to tell it to place the database in an non-NFS partition:\nSQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'sqlite:////opt/logs/sandbox/airbnb/superset.db'\n\nThen update the environment variable:\nexport PYTHONPATH=/opt/logs/sandbox/airbnb/\n\nAnother option is possibly to create a symlink in ~/.superset to a different directory on non-NFS partition.\n\nEdit: added PYTHONPATH so it's visible to
