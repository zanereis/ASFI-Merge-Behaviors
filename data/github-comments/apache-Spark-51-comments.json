I'm not exactly sure how `@transient lazy val`s work with spark and serialization) instead of once per group / output row.\n- Use `MutableRow` where ever possible.\n- Use the `Projection` and `MutableProjection` interface (which internally uses while loops / raw arrays, and will make switching to code gen easier).\n- Avoid `.map` and `.foreach` in the critical path (they used all over for setup though, which I think is okay) and instead write while loops.\n- Build the hash table that holds aggregate buffers in a streaming fashion, instead of doing one big `groupBy` per-partition and then working on the materialized groups.\n- Stream the output through a custom `Iterator` instead of materializing it all and then calling `.toIterator`\n- Special case operations where there are no aggregate expressions (Don't build a hash table at all).  The critical thing here is, before we were calling `.count()` and then doing something if that came back empty (you always output a single row when there are no grouping expressions, even if there is no input).  Now, we don't double compute the child RDD or break lineage in these cases.\n\nBasically... we were not being very careful about performance at all before ;)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39397158/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39398593","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/306#issuecomment-39398593","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/306","id":39398593,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5Mzk4NTkz","user":{"login":"kanzhang","id":940009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0MDAwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/940009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kanzhang","html_url":"https://github.com/kanzhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kanzhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kanzhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kanzhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kanzhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kanzhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kanzhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kanzhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kanzhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kanzhang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-02T23:57:14Z","updated_at":"2014-05-20T21:47:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"When the driver sends StopExecutor to executor (log msg \"Driver commanded a shutdown\"), it also ends up here.

Yes, we have a responsibility to keep improving the trees going forward so getting additional feedback is awesome.\n\nThe feedback around the current implementation in the 'Miscellaneous' section is around renaming and minor refactoring of code. I agree with most of the feedback and some choices are personal preferences which should discuss and resolve. We should address it soon when we implement the better `Impurity` interface that we promised to implement ASAP. \n\nI think the \"Error\" interface you described is very similar to what @mengxr proposed as well. We should discuss the naming convention. Even though I don't feel strongly about \"Impurity\" but \"Error\" might not be the best name for the classification scenario. I am open to better names and ready to be convinced otherwise. :-)\n\nFor 'General Design Notes', I have similar thoughts but I will wait for @etrain's comments since he has thought about it carefully. In general, I like @etrain 's MLI design for Model and Algorithm. I did not tie the current implementation to the existing traits yet since I wanted to have a broader conversation about it after the tree PR. It's straightforward to implement once we agree on the interfaces for mllib algorithms.\n\nFinally, and most importantly, thanks a ton for performing such extensive tests on a massive dataset! The results are not too shabby.

for your comments. I just did a test of the ctrl-c case using Spark Shell. When I used ctrl-c to exit the shell, both Executor log and Master log showed that they detected app/driver disassociated. The Executor tries to shut itself down with exit code 1. However, the Master's finishApplication() wins in my test. Worker's log shows it accepted Master's request to kill the executor and the executor's final state is KILLED. It could have happened the other way with the executor exited with code 1, Worker marked its state as EXITED, and Master tried to launch a replacement executor (since exit code is not 0), which eventually got KILLED when Master detects app disassociated. Either way is fine in my opinion. I don't think we need to force users to call stop(). It's just that if it is not called, its executors may get KILLED.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39404001/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39404120","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/295#issuecomment-39404120","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/295","id":39404120,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NDA0MTIw","user":{"login":"AmplabJenkins","id":4031291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzEyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4031291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/AmplabJenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-03T01:37:23Z","updated_at":"2014-04-03T01:37:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"
