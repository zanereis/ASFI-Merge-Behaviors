For realtime segments, the controller will place them in CONSUMING state first. This state indicates that the segment is not completed on the server side.\n\nWith multiple replicas in CONSUMING state (set to consume either by time or number of records), the controller co-ordinates amongst the consumers so that one of them commits the segment (by uploading it), and the others either keep what they have (if they are at the same offset), or catch up to the correct offset, or discard and download the segment from the controller.\n\nThe replica instances for each segment is stored in PROPERTYSTORE as a map, when the table is provisioned, and updated when the cluster is expanded (the update requires no downtime).\n\nWhen a segment is committed, the controller marks the segment state in IDEALSTATE as ONLINE and starts another segment in the CONSUMING state.\n\nThe protocol has been validated by prototype as in the branch https://github.com/linkedin/pinot/tree/LLConsumerPrototype\n\nThe Broker will be modified to introduce a routing table that routes to the new low-level consumer segments (differentiated by segment naming convention).\n\nTransitioning a cluster from high-level consumer to low-level consumer will not require a downtime. Extra hardware may be required during transition phase.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/226568221/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/226568384","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/178#issuecomment-226568384","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/178","id":226568384,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNjU2ODM4NA==","user":{"login":"xiangfu0","id":1202120,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDIxMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1202120?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0","html_url":"https://github.com/xiangfu0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-16T18:15:35Z","updated_at":"2016-06-16T18:15:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mcvsubbu, kafka could handle topic partition expansion without downtime, but not partition shrink.\nSince I have multiple realtime tables on same host and it maybe hard to do this maintenance. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/226568384/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/226570194","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/207#issuecomment-226570194","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/207","id":226570194,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNjU3MDE5NA==","user":{"login":"jfim","id":246807,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjgwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfim","html_url":"https://github.com/jfim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-16T18:22:00Z","updated_at":"2016-06-16T18:22:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Is this only for prefix search (eg.

They both use columnar format for storage and a query processing engine on top. They differ in some integration aspects with other pieces of big data. For example in LinkedIn we run Pinot at a large scale (1000s of machines and 100s of tables). Pinot can directly consume data from Kafka and also from Hadoop. I cannot comment about Druid as I do not know their install base. There are a few features that might be missing in one and available in other and vice versa. Also, recently LinkedIn team has decided to make all their commits directly into open source. So any future development we do will land in open source immediately. There You will be getting the latest and greatest version all the time. From what I hear Uber is also using Pinot for their internal analytics. So your choice of technology will depend on the comfort levels. If I can find more details about DRUID installations I will be happy to share. That being said, I have a bias towards recommending Pinot as my team is actively working on it on a day to day basis.
