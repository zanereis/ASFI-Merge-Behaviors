I also added io-it-suite-local profile that was missing and jenkins job definition.\r\n\r\n>Writing using JDBCIO is fine. Probably your pipeline is slow since you do all the writing From a single worker. Consider creating a PCollection of seed objects (splits) followed by a Reshuffle() followed by writing.\r\n\r\nI added only the reshuffle and it seems to be a little bit helpful. I didn't optimise it further due to a  problem: different \"consolidatedHashes\" get calculated for each test run for datasets bigger than 600 000 rows. This makes it unable to determine hash for a large scale dataset (eg. 40 000 000 rows). The amount of read and written rows is the same. I also have the same problems while running JdbcIOIT on larger datasets. Also, as I checked, the database content seems to be all right. I can create a JIRA for that after you review this PR and agree that this behavior is odd, ok?\r\n\r\n600 000 is approx. 160 MB. I wouldn't call that a large scale test but I think it is something we can start with and then increase the scale and optimize it gradually if needed and if possible (e.g. after tackling the hash calculaction problem i described).

in late to this thread, but having spent way too much of my time fixing brittle tests due to strict exception messages others wrote, I would take a different balance here. The reason assertRaisesRegexp uses `re.search` (rather than, say, `re.match`) is that it's more helpful to see if certain valuable information occurs than check the message exactly. Also, these markers, along with escaping periods and such, add noise when writing (and reading) the test that IMHO outweighs the benefits obtained by stricter testing (the odds that we have  regression that only turns the period of a message into something else are vanishingly small). \r\n\r\nThe value in these tests are that (1) an exception is raised for invalid configurations and (2) there is enough content to the raised exception for a user to act on.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/356399479/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/356411450","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/4366#issuecomment-356411450","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4366","id":356411450,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NjQxMTQ1MA==","user":{"login":"udim","id":127695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzY5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/127695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim","html_url":"https://github.com/udim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-09T20:56:26Z","updated_at":"2018-01-09T20:56:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I agree with you Robert, and I would add another value of message testing: asserting the type of exception raised, since a lot of these tests expect generic exceptions like RuntimeError or Exception.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/356411450/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/356413030","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/4366#issuecomment-356413030","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4366","id":356413030,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NjQxMzAzMA==","user":{"login":"robertwb","id":486017,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjAxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/486017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb","html_url":"https://github.com/robertwb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-09T21:02:28Z","updated_at":"2018-01-09T21:02:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"One difficulty with asserting the type is that not all runners raise the\noriginal (possibly remotely-originated) exception.
