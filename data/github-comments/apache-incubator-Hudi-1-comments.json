This is because, it effectively becomes a circular dependency and thats not a thing in Spark\r\n\r\nOff to exploring ways, to implement an RDD ourselves to do the caching. This is not straightforward.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/270984146/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/270988084","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/42#issuecomment-270988084","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/42","id":270988084,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MDk4ODA4NA==","user":{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-06T19:44:27Z","updated_at":"2017-01-06T19:44:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"\r\n    Think about supporting multiple delta files - on compaction failures\r\n    Fall back of on-disk merge if the delta file size exceeds certain limit\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/270988084/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/270993064","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/50#issuecomment-270993064","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/50","id":270993064,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MDk5MzA2NA==","user":{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-06T20:05:29Z","updated_at":"2017-01-06T20:05:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"For example Index, storage/table type etc..

All low-level operation of creating a commit code was in HoodieClient which made it hard to share code if there was a compaction commit.\n2. HoodieTableMetadata contained a mix of metadata and filtering files. (Also few operations required FileSystem to be passed in because those were called from TaskExecutors and others had FileSystem as a global variable). Since merge-on-read requires a lot of that code, but will have to change slightly on how it operates on the metadata and how it filters the files. The two set of operation are split into HoodieTableMetaClient and TableFileSystemView. \n3. Everything (active commits, archived commits, cleaner log, save point log and in future delta and compaction commits) in HoodieTableMetaClient is a HoodieTimeline. Timeline is a series of instants, which has an in-built concept of inflight and completed commit markers. \n4. A timeline can be queries for ranges, contains and also use to create new datapoint (create a new commit etc). Commit (and all the above metadata) creation/deletion is streamlined in a timeline\n5. Multiple timelines can be merged into a single timeline, giving us an audit timeline to whatever happened in a hoodie dataset. This also helps with https://github.com/uber/hoodie/issues/55. \n6. Move to java 8 and introduce java 8 succinct syntax in refactored code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/271374096/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/271443736","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/35#issuecomment-271443736","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/35","id":271443736,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MTQ0MzczNg==","user":{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-09T23:44:10Z","updated_at":"2017-01-09T23:44:10Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Upon deep introspection of the Spark 2.x code line, it seems like the changes ought to be in \r\n\r\n- CatalogFileIndex.scala \r\n\r\nNeed more clarity.

To do this, we need to change `PartitionAwareFileIndex`, to call ipf.getSplits based on the annotation.. Doable, but needs some munging of interfaces.

Sorry about the oversight. We will most certainly change the project name. The name (Hoodie) was an extension of HUDI - Hadoop Upsert anD Incrementals. \r\n\r\nIn 3 days, we have a [strata talk](https://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/strata-ca/public/schedule/detail/56511) , where we are talking about Hoodie. We may not be able to change the name everywhere before then, but we will change it soon after and also mention about the name change in the talk (to avoid any confusion). \r\n\r\nHope this does not concur a lot of inconvenience to the hood.ie project. Btw, tried out the quickstart and I think its awesome. Good luck with your project. Will update the this ticket once, we change the name reference in all places. \r\n\r\nCheers\r\nPrasanna\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/285960013/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/285963386","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/91#issuecomment-285963386","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/91","id":285963386,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NTk2MzM4Ng==","user":{"login":"janl","id":11321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl","html_url":"https://github.com/janl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-12T18:22:07Z","updated_at":"2017-03-12T18:22:07Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@prazanna thank you for replying so soon and thank you for taking quick action.\r\n\r\nNo worries about a transition phase.\r\n\r\nAnd good luck with the strata talk! :)\r\n\r\nThank you for the kind words about Hood.ie!\r\n\r\nBest\r\nJan\r\n—","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/285963386/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/286090296","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/93#issuecomment-286090296","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/93","id":286090296,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NjA5MDI5Ng==","user":{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-13T12:12:21Z","updated_at":"2017-03-13T12:12:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"DFSSource and KafkaSource work..

We cannot exceed 2GB in the remote shuffle block after join (ProbableFileId1, RowKey), which is why we auto size and split the partitions (files * records / num_of_elements_that_can_fit_in_2GB) that way. \r\nLets call this number as computed_parallelism.\r\n\r\nAlso there are 2 skew in this discussion,\r\n1. Skew in the number of files to check in the final joined partition\r\n2. Skew in the runtime of each partition\r\nEven if 1 is resolved, we cannot guarantee that we can eliminate 2. The actual work may skew and we cant do anything to solve that. So in any case, we are trying to do an estimate on the work to be done in each partition.\r\n\r\nTo solve 1:\r\nIntroduce indexParallelism (new property) and over provision indexParallelism. The index parallelism will be max(inputRDD.partitionsize, indexparallelism, computed_parallelism).\r\nWith over-provisioning, We may have multiple tasks opening up the same file, but the skew should be handled. computed_parallelism will be a cover in case index parallelism may hit the 2GB limit.\r\n\r\nWe make modifications on how we compute computed_parallelism.

So when you set the mode to be incremental, the appropriate parquet file versions are picked by the input format (https://github.com/uber/hoodie/blob/master/hoodie-hadoop-mr/src/main/java/com/uber/hoodie/hadoop/HoodieInputFormat.java#L104) and using a predicate  _hoodie_commit_time > startTs and _hoodie_commit_time < endTs (which is pushed down when reading the parquet file), we get only the records that changed during that time period.\r\n\r\nhttps://uber.github.io/hoodie/quickstart.html#incremental-queries - this has an example you can try from hive. \r\n\r\nPS: Today, Incremental pull is only supported from the compacted parquet files.

for suggesting this feature.  Sounds like a good thing to add for folks doing pySpark etc ..  I will think a little about file structure for housing python files and report back. \r\n\r\nAt a high level, this sounds a lot like `HoodieReadClient`, it might be worthwhile to see if the logic from the class can be invoked by python? (same way pySpark calls the jvm RDD classes to get its stuff done)..  This would lead to the filtering code maintained in 1 place, 1 language, thus easier to maintain? thoughts? \r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/287906118/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/287906437","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/108#issuecomment-287906437","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/108","id":287906437,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NzkwNjQzNw==","user":{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-20T21:38:36Z","updated_at":"2017-03-20T21:38:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@prazanna and I did a brainstorm, to see if cleaning async should cause issues.
