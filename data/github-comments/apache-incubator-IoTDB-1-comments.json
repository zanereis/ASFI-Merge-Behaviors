I think we can extract the code for repairing a file from `NativeRestorableIOWriter`'s construction function, as `repair(TsFileSequenceReader reader, TsFileOutput output)`, then, a restorable reader `A` can call the function  like `repair(A, new DefaultTsFileOutput(file))`, a restorable writer `B` can call the function like `repair(new TsFileSequenceReader(file, false, false), B)`;\r\n\r\n2. Or, do not add the ability of repairing a file to `TsFileSequenceReader`. Instead, add  child class of `TsFileSequenceReader`, e.g., `class RestorableTsFileReader extends TsFileSequenceReader`. Then, the dependiency looks like:\r\n\r\nA: `TsFileSequenceReader`\r\nB: `NativeRestorableIOWriter`\r\nC: `RestorableTsFileReader`\r\n\r\nthen, \r\nC calls B, B calls A, \r\nC extends A.\r\nA reads file on disk\r\nB writes data to file on disk.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/473265717/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/473266930","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iotdb/pull/99#issuecomment-473266930","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/99","id":473266930,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MzI2NjkzMA==","user":{"login":"jixuan1989","id":1021782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjE3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1021782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jixuan1989","html_url":"https://github.com/jixuan1989","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jixuan1989/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jixuan1989/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jixuan1989/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jixuan1989/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jixuan1989/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jixuan1989/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jixuan1989/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jixuan1989/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jixuan1989/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-15T12:27:35Z","updated_at":"2019-03-15T12:27:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"if the method is only used for test, then I can approve it.
