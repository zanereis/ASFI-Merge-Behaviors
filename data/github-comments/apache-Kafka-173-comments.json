The tests will fail when there are no source nodes defined in the test topology.\r\n\r\nI think that's fine -- for tests it would be a testing error to not add a source. Not sure if we have a proper test for real topologies to guard against it (only required for PAPI) -- for KStreamBuilder it cannot happen. Maybe `TopologyBuilder` should contain a test that ensures that the DAG is connected and \"well-formed\" ? But I actually think, we would not even generate the `ProcessorTopology` in the first place -- we start building it from the sources, and if no source was added, the whole `ProcessorTopology` would be empty.\r\n\r\n> Also, if the defined source nodes are not related with partitions, the tests will also fail due to the NullPointerException in StreamTask 125:\r\n\r\nThis would also be a testing error only. For real topologies, if there are not partitions, we would not create a task for the `SourceNode` in the first place and thus, this code should never be executed.\r\n\r\n\\cc @enothereska @dguy
