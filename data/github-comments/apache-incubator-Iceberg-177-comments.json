It looks like the API that you're using isn't a streaming API, which is what we typically want so that we can avoid things like buffering whole files in memory before writing them with a single PUT. When I went looking more into how to use boto3 for streaming reads and streaming writes, I quickly ran into `smart_open`, which appears to do everything that we want.\r\n\r\nI think you had a S3FileIO that used smart_open before.

Is that why we need the UDFs? Is it normal to preprocess the Flink input or does one typically do that via Calcite or does Flink provide mechanisms / interfaces that we might propose to them to make transforms supported?\r\n\r\n1. The difference from spark here is that the partition field name in spark is generated by iceberg by default, while flink can specify the field name in the computed column, so the partition field name uses the name specified by the user.\r\nSuch as, when use `CREATE tb (ts timestamp) USING iceberg PARTITIONED BY (years(ts))`, we get the partition filed name: `ts_years` by default.\r\nBut in flink, when use `CREATE tb (ts timestamp, pts AS years(ts)) PARTITIONED BY (pts)` , we get the partition filed name: `pts`.\r\n2. We use udf purpose:\r\na. Because flinksql does not support adding functions after `PARTITIONED BY`, so we put the functions in the computed columns, and these function names correspond to iceberg's transforms one-to-one.\r\nb. UDF can limit user input to a certain extent. For example, users can write `years(col)`, but cannot write `years(13, col)`.\r\nc. As you said, we can directly get the partition of a data through UDF, such as `select buckets(10, 'abc')`.\r\n\r\nOf course, maybe the above things can be implemented with Calcite, but since I am not particularly familiar with Calcite, the implementation may be more complicated, and it may also require the cooperation of flink, so we prefer to use this simpler way.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1153575379/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1153576463","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/5000#issuecomment-1153576463","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/5000","id":1153576463,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85Ewi4P","user":{"login":"wuwenchi","id":19755729,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzU1NzI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19755729?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwenchi","html_url":"https://github.com/wuwenchi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwenchi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwenchi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwenchi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwenchi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwenchi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwenchi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwenchi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwenchi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwenchi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-13T07:34:27Z","updated_at":"2022-06-13T07:34:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> My original concern with #4625 is that it doesn't seem like something that would work well for interoperability with other engines.\r\n\r\nOther engines do not recognize watermarks and computed columns, so when using non-flink engines, watermark and computed column related properties are ignored.\r\nI think this has no effect on other engines, because watermarks and computed columns themselves do not actually store data, they just will add some logical processing when querying, but these logics only take effect on flink.What is actually stored is the data of the original physical columns, and the related format has not changed. \r\nFor this point, similar to the `write.upsert.enabled` property, if this property is configured, it will be written in upsert mode when using flink, and when writing data using other engines, this property will be ignored directly.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1153576463/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1153661091","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2105#issuecomment-1153661091","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2105","id":1153661091,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85Ew3ij","user":{"login":"zoucao","id":32817398,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyODE3Mzk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32817398?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoucao","html_url":"https://github.com/zoucao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoucao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoucao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoucao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoucao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoucao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoucao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoucao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoucao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoucao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-13T09:00:58Z","updated_at":"2022-06-13T09:00:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @klam-shop should be done before end of Q2. right now, main challenge is committers' review bandwidth.\r\n\r\nHi @stevenzwu, is this PR nearly finished?
