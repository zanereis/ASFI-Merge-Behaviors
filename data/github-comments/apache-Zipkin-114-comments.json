\r\nHere is the further analysis after your PR for the basic ARM64 support is merged.\r\n\r\nAfter deprecating test for “zipkin-cassandra” docker image, build is terminating for “zipkin-elasticsearch6”, “zipkin-elasticsearch7”, “zipkin-mysql”, “zipkin-kafka” docker images.\r\nThese images are available for Linux/AMD64, but not for Linux/ARM64. \r\nBelow are the errored logs in brief:\r\n~~~\r\n2020-11-05 08:46:18:283 [main] ERROR 🐳 [ghcr.io/openzipkin/zipkin-mysql:2.22.1] - Log output from the failed container:\r\nstandard_init_linux.go:211: exec user process caused

did not start correctly.\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nI have tried building them on a local Linux/ARM64 machine. “zipkin-elasticsearch6”, “zipkin-mysql”, “zipkin-kafka” docker images are building successfully on the ARM64 platform. But “zipkin-elasticsearch7” fails to build on ARM64 because the Dockerfile is downloading an elasticsearch binary (with no jdk) from here  <https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-oss-7.9.3-no-jdk-linux-x86_64.tar.gz>.  \r\nThis binary is not available for the AArch64 platform. However elasticsearch is releasing another binary for AArch64 (with jdk). Please find it here <https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-7.9.3-linux-aarch64.tar.gz>. \r\n“Zipkin-elasticsearch7” docker image is successfully getting built for ARM64 after using this binary for elasticsearch on a local ARM64 machine.\r\n\r\nIt will be really helpful if “zipkin-elasticsearch6”, “zipkin-mysql”, “zipkin-kafka” docker images become available for Linux/ARM64 on the zipkin Docker Hub.\r\nAlso, can you please suggest whether we can use elasticsearch binary (with jdk) for building “zipkin-elasticsearch7” docker image? If yes, then I can raise a PR for the ARM64 support in the Dockerfile used to build “zipkin-elasticsearch7” docker image.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/722423600/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/722709596","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3166#issuecomment-722709596","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3166","id":722709596,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyMjcwOTU5Ng==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-05T23:46:52Z","updated_at":"2020-11-05T23:46:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@odidev there was a problem in our build identified yesterday on the base layers.

One common approach (for example in the Beats) is to \"dedot\" tags — replacing dots with underscores.

Alternatively the [flattened field type](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/flattened.html) might be an interesting alternative: It doesn't create a mapping for that field and thus avoids the issue of having a mapping collision with `foo` and `foo.bar` (`foo` cannot be a concrete type and an object at the same time) — @msmsimondean I assume that's the problem you ran into. Otherwise flattened behaves pretty much like a keyword field, so it should be a good match for tags.

You mentioned this is for clients who have Z hardware. **Can you have a couple users comment directly on this issue that they will use this?**\r\n> \r\n--> I cannot bring you any client's comments because the Knative enablement on Z-system is in progress. We try to start this s390x enablement for Zipkin because Zipkin is deployed as the tracing configuration with the docker image `docker.io/openzipkin/zipkin` in the upstream's e2e test. (but not really used in the tests, just configuration check so far) I can say we could put this discussion underneath again and would bring it back when the real clients using the Knative on Z-system would make a request for the Zipkin.\r\n> Some notes s390x:\r\n> \r\n> * our [base image](https://github.com/openzipkin/docker-alpine) will likely work https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=openjdk15&branch=edge\r\n> * automatically downloading NPM cross-platform won't work due to missing musl+390x [here](https://nodejs.org/dist/v14.15.1/)\r\n>   \r\n>   * musl isn't [here](https://unofficial-builds.nodejs.org/download/release/v14.15.1/) either\r\n>   * installing NPM directly should work the same as arm64 though https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=nodejs-current\r\n> * integration tests will have similar problems to arm64 #3166 as we build docker images for tests.
