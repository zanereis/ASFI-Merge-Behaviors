In other words, tests must prove that code doesn't mess up the intermediate data.\r\n* Not everyone has busted instrumentation. For example, I notice at py_zipkin examples, there is routine mistaken service labels where client and server names are flipped. We should be very careful to get diverse feedback especially if going to change high maintenance code before deferring towards something that may be a side effect of bad instrumentation.\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, the prioritization is only needed when there is only one label. We have no need to constrain the lens code to single label.\r\n\r\nSo, my plea is that when folks suggest things, please consider the whole context above so that we can make a good change and not add new tech debt.
