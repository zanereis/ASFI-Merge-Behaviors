When prepareTemplate is called, it either falls into prepareTemplateInOneStoragePool if one primary has to be seeded with the template; or into prepareTemplateInAllStoragePool for seeding template in all primary pools available. prepareTemplateInAllStoragePool too calls into prepareTemplateInOneStoragePool for seeding the template. prepareTemplateInOneStoragePool schedules a thread to seeded the template on a given primary storage. The actual work of seeding the template is done by prepareTemplateForCreate. Their were   no unit tests for this routine. I have written unit tests for the same. It was more meaningful to write tests for this routine, as it is here, where the actual work happens. prepareTemplate and prepareTemplateInOneStoragePool just schedule a thread/executor to seed the primary pools.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/128292255/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/128292596","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/661#issuecomment-128292596","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/661","id":128292596,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyODI5MjU5Ng==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-06T08:39:01Z","updated_at":"2015-08-06T08:39:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[cloudstack-pull-requests #917](https://builds.apache.org/job/cloudstack-pull-requests/917/) SUCCESS\nThis pull request looks good\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/128292596/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/128293184","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/660#issuecomment-128293184","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/660","id":128293184,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyODI5MzE4NA==","user":{"login":"karuturi","id":186833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjgzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/186833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi","html_url":"https://github.com/karuturi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-06T08:43:06Z","updated_at":"2015-08-06T08:43:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"ok.
