In the code clean up, would you be considering factor out let-chain traversal possibly as an utility ?. I see a pattern that the current implementation of Let node is had \"pre\" and \"post\" processing stage that is being done prior and after the pushing them to the stack. So I was wondering, whether its possible to expose a generic interface just to provide the pre processing functionality (going down the let chain) and post processing functionality (coming up the let chain). I m not sure how the actual implementation should look like -- do let me know what you have in mind :) .","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/770751801/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/770758978","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7334#issuecomment-770758978","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7334","id":770758978,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MDc1ODk3OA==","user":{"login":"ybai62868","id":17467736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDY3NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17467736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybai62868","html_url":"https://github.com/ybai62868","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybai62868/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybai62868/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybai62868/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybai62868/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybai62868/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybai62868/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybai62868/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybai62868/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybai62868/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-01T10:42:04Z","updated_at":"2021-02-01T10:42:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@masahi Hiï¼Œ what I mean \"it still does not work\" is that it will report this message \" **tvm.error.OpNotImplemented: The following operators are not supported for frontend ONNX: CumSum** \" although I add and change the AttrCvt(\"cumsum\",{\"axis\": axis, \"dtype\": dtye}) and rename the CumSum to cumsum.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/770758978/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/770960941","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7374#issuecomment-770960941","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7374","id":770960941,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MDk2MDk0MQ==","user":{"login":"mbrookhart","id":4065489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNjU0ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4065489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart","html_url":"https://github.com/mbrookhart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-01T15:58:20Z","updated_at":"2021-02-01T15:58:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@manupa-arm Thanks for the suggestion. @altanh and I were talking about doing something similar late last week using higher order functions.

I think it is great to enable support for some form of While loop.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to have an RFC thread discussing the alternatives in the IR node design. Since the IR node design can impact the general ability to do analysis and will impact how would we engineer future transformation passes.\r\n\r\nFor example, I can see two possible variants:\r\n\r\n- V0: Put the condition into the for loop as it is (the current approach)\r\n- V1: Introduce a separate While node for while loops\r\n\r\nV0 means the for loop is somewhat overloaded for both while and For. On one hand it brings the benefit of richer semantics and the minimum set of changes to enable such feature.\r\n\r\nThis does mean that the visitors to For would need to handle the semantics of break. Given that the for loop is used for regular interval analysis, it could be beneficial to distinguish between \"regular structured loop\" vs \"un-structured loop\", unless the condition testing also offers some analysis benefits.\r\n\r\nI think this PoC is a great start and would be great to have a design discussion over the RFC\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/771192686/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/771196446","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/7379#issuecomment-771196446","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7379","id":771196446,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MTE5NjQ0Ng==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-01T22:14:31Z","updated_at":"2021-02-01T22:14:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Please open a new thread on https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/771196446/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/771210096","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7385#issuecomment-771210096","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7385","id":771210096,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MTIxMDA5Ng==","user":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-01T22:40:35Z","updated_at":"2021-02-01T22:40:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@tqchen Yes, what you said totally makes sense to me.

couple of different lines that need to match:\r\n- line 57 should be either `micro('host')` or `micro(<device>)`, depending on situation 1 or 2\r\n- line 76 should either instantiate `DefaultCompiler` or `ZephyrCompiler`, depending on situation 1 or 2\r\n- line 77, the argument should either be (approximately) `$CRT_ROOT_DIR/host` or `path/to/runtime/crt`, depending on situation 1 or 2\r\n\r\nit seems like based on your comment at the end of the file, you want situation 1--so just fix up line 57 and things should work properly. right now, `DefaultCompiler` is invoking the ARM cross-compiler

it is a little bit more complicated than just specifying the Compiler implementation when cross-compiling. when using DefaultCompiler, there is assumption that all of the code needed to run the _platform_ (I.e. SoC startup code, peripheral config) lives in a `main.cc` or in a library you supply to `build_static_runtime(extra_libs=)`. on POSIX systems, this assumption doesn't impose much on the build, but in a bare metal deployment situation it's much different.\r\n\r\nto increase compatibility with the many dev boards out there, we compile against a cross-platform deployment framework (Zephyr). most cross-platform bare-metal deployment frameworks include their own build system to determine which sources to include and the compiler config e.g. cflags, ldflags. Zephyr does this from CMakeLists.txt and prj.conf. making it convention to include this config in TVM Python scripts would mean that convention is to replicate the build system from the RTOS you're using.\r\n\r\nunfortunately we kind of built out this Compiler abstraction without paying too much attention to that, so it's kind of the wrong level of abstraction to use here. the long-term solution to this problem is to replace Compiler with something more \"project-level,\" where \"project\" roughly refers to the startup code, RTOS, and other application specific code you need to run models on a bare metal device. See #6 on the [ÂµTVM M2 roadmap](https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/tvm-microtvm-m2-roadmap/8821).\r\n\r\nto address your question B: you are still welcome to instantiate a Compiler impl of your choice and this doesn't need to live in the TVM source tree. until the project API refactor is done, happy to include additional impls into the TVM tree so long as they can be tested (see `tests/micro/qemu/test_zephyr.py`).\r\n\r\nin the short term, I think it would be great to change DefaultCompiler to error when you try to compile a file with a cortex-m target. that would be adjusting the logic [here](https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/main/python/tvm/micro/compiler.py#L101). want to take a shot at that?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/771968417/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/771972321","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7366#issuecomment-771972321","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7366","id":771972321,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MTk3MjMyMQ==","user":{"login":"CircleSpin","id":19177012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MTc3MDEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19177012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CircleSpin","html_url":"https://github.com/CircleSpin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CircleSpin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CircleSpin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CircleSpin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CircleSpin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CircleSpin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CircleSpin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CircleSpin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CircleSpin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CircleSpin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-02T20:47:13Z","updated_at":"2021-02-02T20:47:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the catches you both found, @comaniac and @leandron :smiley:  ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/771972321/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/772000660","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7392#issuecomment-772000660","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7392","id":772000660,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MjAwMDY2MA==","user":{"login":"manupak","id":61496855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNDk2ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61496855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak","html_url":"https://github.com/manupak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-02T21:27:18Z","updated_at":"2021-02-02T21:29:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @areusch ,\r\n\r\nA follow up question, what are your thoughts on the effect of the usage of DefaultCompiler.library() function's support to get the operator library as an archive though?

We only need to look at the registry for the function by its name. This is even simpler because the only thing you need to serialize and pass around is the function name and arguments.\r\n\r\n> On the other hand, the process of measure assume creation of second process and passing the task for measure in the second process. The object should be serializable. I believe eveything work with cpython and functino by the same reason as with workload id/list of tensor. content of the task is not serialized, due to implementation of cpython process just forks and all objects are on the same place as in original process.\r\n> \r\n> I can add workaround - to verify the type of the content and if it is a list of tensors, apply SaveJSON, in other case do not call.

The same ops exist in caffe2, too https://caffe2.ai/docs/sparse-operations.html So I'd say this op is not specific to TF and generally useful for recsys or possibly NLP use cases. \r\n\r\nThis op can be implemented by composing embedding op + reduce, and that is how ONNX exports PyTorch `EmbeddingBag` op.

Both PyTorch and caffe2 use custom fused embedding lookup + on the fly reduce to efficiently implement these ops.\r\n\r\nWe cannot rely on automatic fusion of embedding + reduce, because our op fusion doesn't fuse any ops before a reduction op (if I remember correctly) cc @jwfromm @mbrookhart ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/773134472/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/773154955","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7401#issuecomment-773154955","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7401","id":773154955,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MzE1NDk1NQ==","user":{"login":"t-vi","id":20787943,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzg3OTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20787943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/t-vi","html_url":"https://github.com/t-vi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t-vi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t-vi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t-vi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t-vi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t-vi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t-vi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t-vi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t-vi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t-vi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-04T09:14:39Z","updated_at":"2021-02-04T09:14:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I'm curious how it integrates with PyTorch frontend.
