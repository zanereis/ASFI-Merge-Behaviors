@wilderrodrigues :)\nI guess the status of this PR is that it was waiting for me to fix the build issues... i was away since last wednesday and just got back yesterday, so i hadn't had time to look into it until last night.\n\nThe OVM3 failure in jenkins is indeed unrelated to my changes, it seems it's failing for a few PRs whenever it gets built on specific jenkins servers... probably due do different jenkins configs.\n\nAbout the testing, i had only run the existing JUnit tests and did some manual testing on the mentioned platforms (service startup/config issues, tomcat performance/startup and java8 supportability for some things that were failing) and did not test the whole platform.. i still didn't have a look at Marvin, i hope i'll have time to start playing with it over the next week :)\n\n@bhaisaab all
