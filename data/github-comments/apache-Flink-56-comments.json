is:\nTaskConfiguration <-- TaskDeploymentDescriptor <-- JobVertex <-- StreamConfig \nIn StreamingJobGraphGenerator.java setVertexConfig() function set TaskConfiguration, like this:\n        ...\n        config.setNumberOfOutputs(nonChainableOutputs.size());\n        config.setNonChainedOutputs(nonChainableOutputs);\n        config.setChainedOutputs(chainableOutputs);\n        config.setCheckpointingEnabled(streamGraph.isCheckpointingEnabled());\n        ...\nIf we want to use TaskConfiguration instead of JobConfiguration, we need add special interface to set stormConfig in

I think I've learned something about the JVM by reading your PR description. ;)\n\nWith some minor refactorings in the network stack, we could get rid of a memory copy before putting off-heap segments to the wire. Instead of returning `Buffer` instances we would return `ByteBuf` instances (Netty's recyclable Buffer API), which could then be handed to Netty directly. Currently, we copy from our `Buffer`s to Netty's `ByteBuf`s. I would not expect a huge performance improvement, but I think there are other good reasons to wrap memory in `ByteBuf`s. This is not urgent, but something I wanted to try out for some time now, maybe I'll try something on a free
