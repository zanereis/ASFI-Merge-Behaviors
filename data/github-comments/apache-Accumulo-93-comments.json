The output still needs work as some stuff is missing and it needs cleaning up and refinement.  I did add a verbose flag to spit out the breakdown when data is shared across tables just like the original command does when using a pattern or namespace. Besides working on code cleanup and fixing up the output (maybe with more flags to do extra things to customize the output) there are still no tests yet since I'm still experimenting so hopefully I can get to that when I am back to working on it at the end of the week so I can get a PR (or at least a draft PR) ready for review.\r\n\r\n**Also a note about shared file linking/detection:**\r\n\r\nRight now when linking shared files only one scan is done, so like the original command, shared files are only going to be detected if the table provided or looked at is referencing files from another table and doesn't \"own\" thtem. So lets say you have table1 and table2 is a clone and they share table1's file. If you ran du currently on table1 then there would be no indication that there was a shared file as only files that come back are owned by table 1. but if you ran a du on table2 then the file that comes back points to table1 so you know its shared. If we want to be able to show shared files between tables in any direction and no matter which table you query then we'd need to scan again for tables that match each file. \r\n\r\nWith the same example you'd need to scan for table1 and get the list of files back that it owned and then scan again with those files to see if any other tables have a hit to associate it. This is not a problem if we use a pattern (regex) and the pattern matches both tables already as when we scan we hit both tables and know they are associated which is why the output of the command for the original \"du\" command looks a bit different depending on if you give it a single table or a regex.\r\n\r\nI think we are ok with this behavior as the old command works the same way and adding extra scans would add complexity and a performance hit that I don't think is necessary. Ultimately it really depends how you want to define shared. One way to look at it is in the example above table1 is not using shared files from table2 as it owns the files, only table2 has shared files being used from table1.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1221365717/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1221393868","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/2847#issuecomment-1221393868","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/2847","id":1221393868,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5IzP3M","user":{"login":"Manno15","id":29436247,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NDM2MjQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29436247?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manno15","html_url":"https://github.com/Manno15","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manno15/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manno15/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manno15/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manno15/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manno15/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manno15/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manno15/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manno15/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manno15/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-20T19:37:27Z","updated_at":"2022-08-20T19:37:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I did run into an interesting bug.

reviewed this as well and it also LGTM. \r\n\r\nThis may not be a big deal but my only comment is it would be nice to see a couple tests written for `ConfigRefreshRunnner` to verify the `verifySnapshotVersions()` method does what it is supposed to do after running, either running directly or through an integration test. (Check the cache entries were removed and configs inside ServerConfigurationFactory were cleared, etc). It's possible there are some existing tests that will exercise the change that already exist but I didn't see it with a quick search.\r\n\r\nRunning it directly would be a little annoying as you would either need to change the scope to package/protected to access it in tests so you could instantiate a new runner and execute `verifySnapshotVersions()` or use reflection.\r\n\r\nFor an ITest I suppose you could make the refresh interval configurable and set it something to be pretty short (a few seconds maybe) to verify it ran properly and evicted

We don't have to do that but the old command doesn't do the calculation total by table, etc in the same format.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1230556161/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1230618147","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/2894#issuecomment-1230618147","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/2894","id":1230618147,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5JWb4j","user":{"login":"DomGarguilo","id":47725857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NzI1ODU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47725857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo","html_url":"https://github.com/DomGarguilo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-29T17:28:43Z","updated_at":"2022-08-29T17:28:43Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Is the only issue NUM_TSERVERS export in fluo-uno/conf/uno.conf?\r\n\r\nFrom my testing, the changes from this PR breaks at least the monitor when setting things up via fluo-uno.
