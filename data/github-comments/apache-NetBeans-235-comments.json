It also doesn't even mean that it influences startup, the bottleneck could be somewhere else and this happens in parallel decoupled from the bottleneck.

I agree with Eirik that very few images actually need to be _localizable_.\n\nAt this point, I wouldn't look to fix the usages across the code base.  We might just consider existing uses on a case by case basis if a downstream consumer complains about un-brandable usage.\n\nIf we do want to look at this from a branding perspective, or there's evidence it's necessary from a performance perspective, I would look at `ImageUtilities` itself.  Ensure branding tokens are taken into account on the non-localized path, then make localization more opt-in.  That would reduce the number of suffixes that are searched quite significantly.  It's also a minor behaviour change, but one possibly worth considering.\n\nEDIT: or alternatively make locale suffixes dependent on a system property that can be enabled in the platform if required.  Do we actually need locale suffixes anywhere in the IDE?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2621399397/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2621748473","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/8206#issuecomment-2621748473","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/8206","id":2621748473,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6cRLT5","user":{"login":"dbalek","id":16077464,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDc3NDY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16077464?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbalek","html_url":"https://github.com/dbalek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbalek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbalek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbalek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbalek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbalek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbalek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbalek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbalek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbalek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-29T14:05:35Z","updated_at":"2025-01-29T14:06:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> what is the performance gain of this optimization?

NB expects to have direct access to latest javac, no matter if it comes from nb-javac or from the JDK. It won't work with lower versions.\n\nNB 25 and 26 will require javac from jdk 24, NB 23 and 24 required javac from jdk 23 etc (you see the pattern).\n\nNBVSCode releases are no longer synced with NB releases - they might ship with different versions since they branch at different times. My guess is that 24.9.9 has nb-javac of NB 25 (it branched late, therefore the .9.9) - but maybe someone from the NBVSCode maintainers can answer that.\n\nedit: so you can either use an older version of (VS)NB or wait for lombok to support JDK 24 i guess (maybe they have ea releases)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2628948475/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2628953814","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/8218#issuecomment-2628953814","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/8218","id":2628953814,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6csqbW","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-01T13:28:22Z","updated_at":"2025-02-01T13:28:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> win 11 on a surface pro\n\nand\n\n```\njava.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError: Exception java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: C:\\Program Files\\Netbeans\\netbeans-24\\ide\\modules\\lib\\extbrowser64.dll: Can't load AMD 64-bit .dll on a ARM 64-bit platform [in thread \"org.netbeans.modules.web.clientproject.browser.ActiveBrowserAction\"]\n```\n\nsounds like some of the native libs don't support arm atm https://github.com/apache/netbeans/blob/e38f61876b02c5f47b0a4b019426812e54c2689f/ide/extbrowser/src/org/netbeans/modules/extbrowser/NbDdeBrowserImpl.java#L77\n\nWould be curious if it works if you set `-J-Dorg.netbeans.modules.extbrowser.UseDesktopBrowse=true`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2628953814/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2628961662","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/8218#issuecomment-2628961662","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/8218","id":2628961662,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6cssV-","user":{"login":"rockyAdmin","id":145230388,"node_id":"U_kgDOCKgKNA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/145230388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockyAdmin","html_url":"https://github.com/rockyAdmin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockyAdmin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockyAdmin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockyAdmin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockyAdmin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockyAdmin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockyAdmin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockyAdmin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockyAdmin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockyAdmin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-01T13:51:34Z","updated_at":"2025-02-01T13:51:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I  included the switch you suggested:\n\n\"Would be curious if it works if you set -J-Dorg.netbeans.modules.extbrowser.UseDesktopBrowse=true\"\n\nIt had no effect.\nSeems hard to believe something like this would no have been picked up before the release.\n\nIf I open the browser separately and call the localhost the it executes just fine.

This is intended for those who commit once per release or less - or those who keep forgetting how delivery works.\r\n\r\nthe collapsible section can be also set to auto collapse by manually removing the `open` from `<details open>`, this would add another method to de-noise the PR text as middle ground - if you don't want to remove the whole thing.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2629039793/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2629041182","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/8218#issuecomment-2629041182","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/8218","id":2629041182,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6cs_we","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-01T17:37:45Z","updated_at":"2025-02-01T17:37:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"the stacktrace sounds like all it wants is to open a tab.
