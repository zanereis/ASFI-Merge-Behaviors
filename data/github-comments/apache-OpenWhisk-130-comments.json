suggested to use a single SPI implementation for `ContainerProxy` and `ContainerPool`.\r\n\r\nAt first time, I thought of this kind of approach.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\ntrait ContainerPoolProvider extends Spi {\r\n  def getContainerPoolProps(childFactory: ActorRefFactory => ActorRef,\r\n            poolConfig: ContainerPoolConfig,\r\n            activationFeed: ActorRef,\r\n            someConfig: Option[PrewarmingConfig] = None): Props\r\n\r\n  def getContainerProxyProps(factory: (TransactionId, String, ImageName, Boolean, ByteSize, Int) => Future[Container],\r\n            ack: (TransactionId, WhiskActivation, Boolean, InstanceId, UUID) => Future[Any],\r\n            store: (TransactionId, WhiskActivation) => Future[Any],\r\n            collectLogs: (TransactionId, Identity, WhiskActivation, Container, ExecutableWhiskAction) => Future[ActivationLogs],\r\n            instance: InstanceId,\r\n            poolConfig: ContainerPoolConfig,\r\n            unusedTimeout: FiniteDuration = timeouts.idleContainer,\r\n            pauseGrace: FiniteDuration = timeouts.pauseGrace): Props\r\n\r\n  def requiredProperties: Map[String, String]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nSo we can create both `ContainerProxy` and `ContainerPool` implementation with one trait.\r\nBut with this approach, companion object of them should mix in the same trait, `ContainerPoolProvider`.\r\nSince that trait has two abstract methods, it is required for all objects which mix in this trait to override both methods.\r\nAccordingly `ContainerProxy` and `ContainerPool` should override unnecessary methods respectively.\r\n\r\nOne option is to make `ContainerProxy` as a inner class of `ContainerPool` and only expose `ContainerPool` via SPI.\r\nBut it might introduce huge changes.\r\n\r\nAs of now I am not quite sure which one is right direction.\r\nI am holding to have multiple SPI for them in one hand, and to make `ContainerProxy` as an inner class of `ContainerPool` in the other hand.\r\n\r\nWDYT?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/391650438/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/391651443","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/3663#issuecomment-391651443","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/3663","id":391651443,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MTY1MTQ0Mw==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-24T09:32:54Z","updated_at":"2018-05-24T09:32:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Discalimer:

Which of these activations should get the tid as activation id\r\n- Same for sequences. Which of the actions should get the tid as activation-id.\r\n- One of the ideas of sending the tid to the controller, was to generate the tid in one of the providers and pass it with the request. With this ability you would be able to trace a request from end to end.

Activation ID should not be exposed by the system instead, users can decide to whether expose it or not using existing activation id parameter in case the action is a webaction.\r\n2. Use request ID generated by nginx or gateway as Activation ID as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegarding 1, I initially raised this issue in the aspect of UI. When providing the functionality to display activation results and logs after an invocation of an action in UI, it's not easy to select right activation when the action is webaction.\r\n\r\nIn case of normal action also, since activation logs are collected asynchronously, it's not that simple.\r\nBut anyway we can look it up because it returns activation ID in the response.\r\n\r\nFor webactions, it's not easy to choose a specific activation, and display logs for web actions without system support.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions for this?\r\n\r\nWith regard to 2, so request ID would be Transaction ID and Activation ID.\r\nMore precisely Transaction id will be same with activation id. Would it be ok?\r\n\r\nI just want to confirm.\r\nAs @ddragosd  said if we can safely assume it is unique, would it be ok for this PR to take that in?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/392477260/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/392498401","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/3709#issuecomment-392498401","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/3709","id":392498401,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MjQ5ODQwMQ==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-28T11:16:00Z","updated_at":"2018-06-06T05:30:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#
