This is not a clear code style.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/152989560/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/152990620","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1214#issuecomment-152990620","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1214","id":152990620,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1Mjk5MDYyMA==","user":{"login":"sachingoel0101","id":8874261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NzQyNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8874261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101","html_url":"https://github.com/sachingoel0101","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-02T11:14:24Z","updated_at":"2015-11-02T11:17:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The lastEnv is set for blocking also, because it still makes sense.

This is very much in line with what I had in mind for a SQL backend.\n\nLet me check if I understood everything correct (and see where my understanding is wrong), because I think we should be able to make an \"exactly once\" version of this based that mechanism. I am basically rephrasing what you describe in a different model.\n\n### Basic Mode\n\nWhat this is effectively doing is a batched and asynchronous version of distributed 2-phase commit transactions. The phases look basically like this:\n- **Adding data**: Pipe all modifications into the database, but not commit the transaction. They are tagged with the timestamp of the upcoming checkpoint (or any coordinated increasing version counter). This can happen in the background thread, for as long as the in-operator cache holds all edits that are not in the database yet.\n- **Pre-commit**: This is when the checkpoint is triggered. All pending edits are written into the database and then the transaction is committed. The state handle only includes the timestamp used on the elements. In the classical 2-phase transactions, after a task acks the pre-commit, it has to be able to recover to that state, which is given here. The checkpoint is not immediately valid for recovery though, which means that recovery has to have either a filter, or issue a query that deletes all records with timestamps larger than the version given during recovery. After the pre-commit, the timestamp is locally incremented and work can continue.\n- **Full commit**: This happens implicitly when the checkpoint coordinator marks the checkpoint as complete.\n- **Recovery**: The timestamp (or version counter) of the last successful checkpoint is restored, the deletion of records that were committed (but where the checkpoint did not succeed as a whole) happens, then records are lazily fetched. \n\nSo far, this should give exactly once guarantees, or am I overlooking something?\n\n### Compacting\n\nWhenever the \"checkpoint complete\" notification comes (or every so many changes) you trigger a clean-up query in the background. Given that the SQL database has a not completely terrible query planner, this SQL statement would be okay efficient (single semi join).\n\n```\nDELETE FROM \"table name\" t1\nWHERE EXISTS \n  (SELECT *\n     FROM \"table name\" t2\n    WHERE t2.handle_id = t1.handle_id\n      AND t2.timestamp > t1.timestamp    //-- a newer version exists for the same handle\n      AND t2.timestamp <= GLOBAL_VERSION //-- and the newer version is globally committed\n  )\n```\n\nThe good thing is that by virtue of having the incrementing global versions, we can set the isolation level for the query to \"read uncommitted\", which means that it will not lock anything and thus not compete with any other ongoing modifications.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/153289042/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/153301440","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1315#issuecomment-153301440","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1315","id":153301440,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MzMwMTQ0MA==","user":{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-03T09:50:26Z","updated_at":"2015-11-03T09:50:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@twalthr Do you want to take care of merging this as well as the other Table API PRs? :smile: \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/153301440/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/153302034","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1304#issuecomment-153302034","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1304","id":153302034,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MzMwMjAzNA==","user":{"login":"mxm","id":837221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNzIyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/837221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm","html_url":"https://github.com/mxm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-03T09:53:10Z","updated_at":"2015-11-03T09:53:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@uce Builds seems to be failing.

Couldn't we then change the semantics of the checkpointId to work like the timestamps (they are somewhat logical, not physical timestamps anyways)?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/153333538/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/153337412","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1305#issuecomment-153337412","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1305","id":153337412,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MzMzNzQxMg==","user":{"login":"gyfora","id":5880972,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODA5NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5880972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora","html_url":"https://github.com/gyfora","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-03T12:26:22Z","updated_at":"2015-11-03T12:26:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"You are right about the checkpointIDs being ignored.

You are right the main idea is exactly as you described. \nThe reason why exactly-once is violated in some corner cases because it can happen that the pre-commit phase of the previous checkpoint is still failing during recovery. \n\nIf we assume that the previous job is completely killed of, no writing to the database whatsoever after that happens, then we can properly clean up during recovery. \n\nThis unfortunately does not seem to hold if you set the retry wait time to very low (like 0 ms in the snapshot). What this means is that the failed job is still writing the failed snapshot to the database after you recovered and cleaned up.\n\nAs for the compaction, I came up with something very similar for compaction but here is the funny thing and my problem. The query you wrote will run properly on Derby but is invalid on MySql (you cannot create a subquery for the same table as you are modifying). In mysql you need to create an inner join, but that will not work in Derby :P \n\nIn any case I have made a prototype of this on: https://github.com/gyfora/flink/tree/compaction\nThe user can define the frequency of compaction (compact every so many checkpoints). And it also makes sure that compaction and cleanup is only executed on 1 subtask to avoid double work.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/153339094/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/153341079","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1315#issuecomment-153341079","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1315","id":153341079,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MzM0MTA3OQ==","user":{"login":"twalthr","id":5746567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDY1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5746567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr","html_url":"https://github.com/twalthr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-03T12:44:43Z","updated_at":"2015-11-03T12:44:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@aljoscha yes, I'll take care of the two PRs ;)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/153341079/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/153347995","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/439#issuecomment-153347995","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/439","id":153347995,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MzM0Nzk5NQ==","user":{"login":"sachingoel0101","id":8874261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NzQyNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8874261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101","html_url":"https://github.com/sachingoel0101","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-03T13:12:30Z","updated_at":"2015-11-03T13:12:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@fhueske This issue is present in the new frontend also.

I think this will be necessary soon.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/153395500/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/153409659","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1220#issuecomment-153409659","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1220","id":153409659,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MzQwOTY1OQ==","user":{"login":"danielblazevski","id":10012612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDEyNjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10012612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielblazevski","html_url":"https://github.com/danielblazevski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielblazevski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielblazevski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielblazevski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielblazevski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielblazevski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielblazevski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielblazevski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielblazevski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielblazevski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-03T16:38:08Z","updated_at":"2015-11-03T16:38:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@chiwanpark , refactored the code using the first method, reads nice and very minimal duplicated code.

It is currently assumed that the recovery timestamp assigned by the checkpoint coordinator is larger than the last checkpoint timestamp assigned before failure. If the clock difference is large enough this might be a problem, although fairly unlikely.\n\nThe alternative approach would be to store the id, key, value triplets in the database (drop the timestamps). Snapshots written between two snapshots would be written with an incremented checkpoint id (and multiple spills to the same key would update the value not insert a new one every time). Cleanup could then be performed by getting the next checkpoint id from the coordinator (which would get it from zookeper). The drawback in this case would be an increased complexity for the batch inserts as we need to be able to handle primary key conflicts efficiently. While this is easy on some databases  (in MySql) in other cases (Derby) can be problematic.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/153470424/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/153500173","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1305#issuecomment-153500173","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1305","id":153500173,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MzUwMDE3Mw==","user":{"login":"gyfora","id":5880972,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODA5NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5880972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora","html_url":"https://github.com/gyfora","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-03T21:49:22Z","updated_at":"2015-11-03T21:49:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I am now writing a prototype for this version, the batch insert got pretty ugly...\nI will probably finish it tomorrow.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/153500173/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/153503199","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1299#issuecomment-153503199","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1299","id":153503199,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MzUwMzE5OQ==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-03T22:01:18Z","updated_at":"2015-11-03T22:01:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Will merge this PR\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/153503199/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/153599182","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1214#issuecomment-153599182","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1214","id":153599182,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MzU5OTE4Mg==","user":{"login":"sachingoel0101","id":8874261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NzQyNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8874261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101","html_url":"https://github.com/sachingoel0101","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-04T06:40:13Z","updated_at":"2015-11-04T06:40:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Build passes.
