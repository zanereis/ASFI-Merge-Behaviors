There are many features need to be implemented!\r\n* Hide `~Trash` prefix\r\n* Notice a note is in the trash\r\n* Disable edit note in the trash (I'm not sure that this is needed, maybe limiting user's behavior)\r\n* Disable renaming note in the trash (not sure as well)\r\n\r\nThe first and second features are needed in my opinion, so I would like to handle those on next PR!\r\n\r\nPlease tell me your opinion.\r\nThanks for the review again. It looks better than before thanks to your comments üòÑ ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/265787911/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/265812295","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1538#issuecomment-265812295","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1538","id":265812295,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NTgxMjI5NQ==","user":{"login":"mfelgamal","id":10679887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjc5ODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10679887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfelgamal","html_url":"https://github.com/mfelgamal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfelgamal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfelgamal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfelgamal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfelgamal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfelgamal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfelgamal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfelgamal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfelgamal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfelgamal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-08T18:14:01Z","updated_at":"2016-12-08T18:14:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bzz @1ambda the script `start-zeppelin.sh` isn't important, it just enforce using port `8080` and zeppelin home dir `/usr/local/zeppelin`, we can ignore it and use `zeppelin.sh`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/265812295/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/265915018","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1663#issuecomment-265915018","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1663","id":265915018,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NTkxNTAxOA==","user":{"login":"karuppayya","id":5082742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwODI3NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5082742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya","html_url":"https://github.com/karuppayya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-09T02:16:24Z","updated_at":"2016-12-09T02:16:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Leemoonsoo Missed pushing a change to the remote, which was causing the issue.\r\nI have fixed it and tested it.

I also agree that current binding page is getting longer (thanks to the Zeppelin contributors :D) and getting hard to find. Definitely needs to be improved. I tested this branch and checked the improvement. Let me share my thought about this patch in here.\r\n\r\n - Currently the restart button is exposed so that ppl can know \"I can restart this interpreter by clicking this button\" by instinct. But \\w this patch, ppl need to click \"Carrot\" button to open the dropdown menu and need to click \"Restart\" button to restart interpreter. And the user need to click at least one time to know about this. \r\n\r\n - Seems don't need another tooltip in here since there is already the text \"Restart\"\r\n![screen shot 2016-12-09 at 4 30 48 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/21041414/37198bb8-be2e-11e6-8d80-9c6420738110.png)\r\n\r\n - The color change for default interpreter is good idea i think! But the color is gone when it comes out as a result. \r\n![search_interpreter](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/21041453/67d16cda-be2e-11e6-9f6c-8b8e77b0a423.gif)\r\n\r\n - Shirking overall size also good idea. Was quite verbose. But the thing that interpreter button has smaller height than dropdown menu is quite awkward to me. \r\n![screen shot 2016-12-09 at 4 50 01 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/21041612/8fdeb128-be2f-11e6-891a-18c2bd760d17.png)\r\n\r\n - How about \"Search bindable interpreters(?)\" instead of \"Search interpreter Bindings\"? :D \r\n<img width=\"335\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-12-09 at 4 48 59 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/21041595/6681d904-be2f-11e6-82c2-c7499f0d0875.png\">\r\n\r\nMost of them in the above are just my personal opinion. So surely you don't need to apply all of them.

We couple many components closely much more than before. (e.g. We usually we add parameter to Constructor of class A to allow it access class B). This would add more complexities to the code base which would make it difficult to add new features and easy to break some function in future. I think maybe we should spend some time to do refactoring to make the component boundary more clean. It would not only make adding new feature easier but also make zeppelin robust and less error-prone.  This comment is not related with PR but just share my thoughts of development of zeppelin. We could merge it first and do the refactoring later. \\cc @Leemoonsoo ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/266264989/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/266265022","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1663#issuecomment-266265022","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1663","id":266265022,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NjI2NTAyMg==","user":{"login":"zjffdu","id":164491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu","html_url":"https://github.com/zjffdu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-11T05:53:05Z","updated_at":"2016-12-11T05:53:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"BTW @karuppayya Do you have any integration test for it ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/266265022/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/266265651","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1663#issuecomment-266265651","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1663","id":266265651,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NjI2NTY1MQ==","user":{"login":"karuppayya","id":5082742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwODI3NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5082742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya","html_url":"https://github.com/karuppayya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-11T06:15:43Z","updated_at":"2016-12-11T06:15:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@zjffdu +1 on the refactor part.\r\nI have written a [test](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1663/files#diff-7d13c722724f9c346f38303f4b435548R326).
