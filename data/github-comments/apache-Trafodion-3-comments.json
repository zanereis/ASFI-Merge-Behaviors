Earlier, IUD operations involve the following 3 steps\n1. HBaseClient_JNI::getHTableClient\n2  HTableClient_JNI::insertRow , insertRows, deleteRow, deleteRows ...\n3. HBaseClient_JNI::releaseHTableClient\n\nThere are 3 JNI to java transistions and a creation of HTableClient_JNI object. Now with this change there is only one step\n\nHBaseClient_JNI::insertRow, insertRows, deleteRow ...\n\nThis method takes in all the parameters needed to accomplish the task and makes only one transition from JNI to java.
