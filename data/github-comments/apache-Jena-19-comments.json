I don't think there is an equivalent for Maven for test only. Due to the licensing conflict between EPSG and AL2 I didn't include it as a non-test dependency.\r\n\r\nThe other two warnings are to do with precision in transformations from the UK's OSGB36 to WGS84. OSGB36 was just an arbritary choice to use a planar coordinate system and conversions from WGS84. I can change the relevant test data to one of the main coordinate reference systems and it should make the warnings go away. There will just be this underlying configuration of the Apache SIS framework.\r\n\r\nI asked Martin Desruisseaux from Apache SIS about the warnings and his response is below.\r\n\r\n\"For the warning that you get, actually I should improve the error message. I presume that the “OSTN15_NTv2_OSGBtoETRS.gsb” datum shift file is not present on your system, so the error message should be \"Can not find OSTN15_NTv2_OSGBtoETRS.gsb datum shift file\". In such case Apache SIS will use a less accurate fallback (more on it later).\r\n\r\nThe SIS_DATA environment variable is used not only for the EPSG database, but also for all other kind of data that SIS may need, including datum shift files. The EPSG embedded database is more convenient, but does not provide any datum shift files yet. We may include some datum shift files in sis-embedded-data in the future, but I don't think we could include all of them for space (and sometime licensing) reasons. Note also that I noticed that the embedded Derby database in a compressed JAR file is at least 5 times slower than a Derby database as ordinary files in a directory.\r\n\r\nIf you want to give a try to SIS_DATA, you can create a DatumChanges sub-directory in the SIS_DATA directory and put the OSTN15_NTv2_OSGBtoETRS.gsb file there (we can download it from internet). You may also opportunistically replace sis-embedded-data module by sis-epsg for better performances (it will create the Derby database in that directory). If you prefer to keep sis-embedded-data for convenience, then you can ignore those warnings. SIS could be improved for making those warnings less disruptive to the users, but we have not determined yet how. In any case, I recommend to take a look at the output of System.out.println(theCoordinateOperation) and check in particular the value inside OperationAccuracy[...] element. The value will be different depending if the datum shift file has been found or not; it is up to the application to decide if the reported accuracy if sufficient for their

We further appreciate a couple sentences regarding who made the modifications, when, and what changes were made in the original DTD -- a common software documentation practice.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/487078186/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/487079179","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/557#issuecomment-487079179","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/557","id":487079179,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NzA3OTE3OQ==","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-26T14:33:38Z","updated_at":"2019-04-26T14:33:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> @afs  Can you point me at what we actually want to run? \r\n\r\nThe tests are in src/test as usual and run with surefire finding \\@Test.

(mvn8 is my script to run mvn with OpenJDK 8)\r\n\r\n#### RAT Legal Check\r\n\r\nAdd to the parent POM:\r\n\r\n    <exclude>**/geosparql_vocab_all_v1_0_1_updated.rdf</exclude>\r\n    Delete logback*.xml\r\n\r\nthen \r\n\r\n    mvn8 clean test\r\n\r\npasses.\r\n\r\n#### Java11\r\n\r\nmaven with OpenJDK11 : has problems which look like a precison/length change somewhere in\r\nthe depths.\r\n\r\n`BufferFFTest` does some comparison of quite large objects, too big to\r\ndescribe here.\r\n\r\nThere are some tests on `LatLonPoint` like:\r\n\r\n    GreatCirclePointDistanceTest.testGetPoint_3args_East:185\r\n    expected: <LatLonPoint{lat=48.84533344929755, lon=-0.9821733277296272}> \r\n    but was:  <LatLonPoint{lat=48.845333449297556, lon=-0.982173327729628}>\r\n\r\nThe test uses `assertEquals(Object,Object)`, no precision factor\r\nconsidered as is available with `assertEquals(double, double, delta)`.\r\nSomething for later.\r\n\r\n#### Module jena-fuseki-geosparql\r\n\r\nWorked first time!\r\n\r\nThere will be a bit of L&N work for `geosparql_vocab_all_v1_0_1_updated.rdf`.\r\n\r\nI think it would be better placed as: \r\n\r\n   /jena-fuseki2/jena-fuseki-geosparql\r\n\r\nbut still run from the top POM (not in jena-fuseki2/pom.xml for now).\r\n\r\nA better Java package name would be to put in the Fuseki family:\r\n\r\n`package org.apache.jena.jena_fuseki_geosparql`\r\n==>\r\n`package org.apache.jena.fuseki.geosparql`\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/487297031/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/487301304","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/557#issuecomment-487301304","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/557","id":487301304,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NzMwMTMwNA==","user":{"login":"desruisseaux","id":1324414,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjQ0MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1324414?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/desruisseaux","html_url":"https://github.com/desruisseaux","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desruisseaux/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desruisseaux/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desruisseaux/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desruisseaux/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desruisseaux/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desruisseaux/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desruisseaux/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desruisseaux/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desruisseaux/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-27T16:46:16Z","updated_at":"2019-04-27T16:46:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"About precision, note that `Math.sin`, `cos` _etc._ are not fully deterministic even in Java.

Furthermore many map projection formulas are only approximations (some have no exact mathematical solution), so the numerical output may vary in future Apache SIS versions depending on improvements or refactoring done on those calculations.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule it is safe to compare with a one centimetre precision (this is the precision reported in EPSG guidance notes for the published formulas).

In preliminary tests I tend run into heap space issues with sets +200m aggregate values in an array and for +1 billion values in settings with large Xmx allocation.

I might fail to see the benefits of using Apache Commons Math here but I used to be turned off by the performance of Arrays.sort in the past.
