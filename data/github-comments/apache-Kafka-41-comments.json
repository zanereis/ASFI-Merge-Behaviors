It seems difficult to completely avoid unnecessary message magic value check when send fetch response back. I chose the way which I think has the least impact. But it might still break if people roll back message.format.version.\n3. I haven't add the configuration sanity check for message.format.version yet.

This PR does not change current behavior of `SimpleAclAuthorizer`. This is how third party authorization implementations would work even now, right?\n\n> If we add config for supported Types:\n> Only the config for supported type has to change.\n\nYet another config.

In the current PR someone trying to add the ACLs using CLI will get an error and someone adding Acls programmatically won't.\n\nThe reason this PR has the checks in CLI is to fail fast. I see your point on programatic access of `SimpleAclAuthorizer`. However, we need to define the expectation of Authorizer interface. We can either say that Authorizer interface, `addAcls` and `removeAcls`, will fail for improper Acls or we can say it does not check. When we are exposing `getSupportedPrincipalTypes`, it is only fair to assume that onus is on clients/callers to check if they are passing proper ACLs in create/remove acls commands.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/180078425/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/180079699","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/806#issuecomment-180079699","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/806","id":180079699,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MDA3OTY5OQ==","user":{"login":"SinghAsDev","id":4915557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MTU1NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4915557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghAsDev","html_url":"https://github.com/SinghAsDev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghAsDev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghAsDev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghAsDev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghAsDev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghAsDev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghAsDev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghAsDev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghAsDev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghAsDev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-04T22:28:30Z","updated_at":"2016-02-04T22:28:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@gwenshap @ijuma mind giving it another pass?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/180079699/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/180079920","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/870#issuecomment-180079920","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/870","id":180079920,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MDA3OTkyMA==","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-04T22:28:45Z","updated_at":"2016-02-04T22:28:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@miguno @ymatsuda \n\nThis also updates the examples following the current serde system to make them runnable.
