will return 2 possible broker's addresses. One is the origin address which has been passed in, another is an address with a different port.

In other words, the VIP channel has the same function with the normal channel.\r\nSo why broker needs 2 server instance?\r\nThe answer is to isolate the read and write operation. Among the API of the message , the most important one is sending message which requires high RTT . It will block netty's IO thread when it occurs message accumulation and impact to write link . The request for consuming message will full of the IO thread pool which will result in the write operation are blocked . In this case , we could send message to VIP channel to guarantee the RTT of sending messages .","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/543606739/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/543615187","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/1544#issuecomment-543615187","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/1544","id":543615187,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MzYxNTE4Nw==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-18T09:02:57Z","updated_at":"2019-10-19T15:51:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\n[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/builds/26416249/badge)](https://coveralls.io/builds/26416249)\n\nCoverage increased (+0.009%) to 50.376% when pulling **6fb66c1f4c8fea6daed15011923fd55665338a31 on areyouok:4.5.2.fix** into **33c756e7b1abaad332774c8b5bccdb17c0588759 on apache:develop**.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/543615187/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/543631363","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/1516#issuecomment-543631363","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/1516","id":543631363,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MzYzMTM2Mw==","user":{"login":"shenhui0509","id":9401184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0MDExODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9401184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenhui0509","html_url":"https://github.com/shenhui0509","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenhui0509/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenhui0509/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenhui0509/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenhui0509/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenhui0509/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenhui0509/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenhui0509/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenhui0509/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenhui0509/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-18T09:33:07Z","updated_at":"2019-10-18T09:33:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> This PR does improve TPS and reduce latency when synchronized replication (Verified by benchmark).

@TonyStark888 如果你在关注事务消息，可以看一下我的fix\r\n> \r\n> https://github.com/areyouok/rocketmq/commits/4.5.2.fix\r\n> \r\n> 我们的结论是当前版本4.5.2的事务消息不是生产可用的。当前我们一共发现4个问题，自定义事务超时时间的功能我们没有使用，所以没太关注。\r\n> \r\n> 问题1，会导致每60秒内，最多有6秒（默认事务超时时间）的所有消息需要回查，我在这里进行了修复：\r\n> \r\n> [areyouok@a9d43fb](https://github.com/areyouok/rocketmq/commit/a9d43fba4a3c5a9284dcb8ba2cbf218f80422e44)\r\n> \r\n> 问题2，end transaction打印日志过多，包括把消息正文以文本形式打印到日志中，这样在一定的压力下，end transaction的速度跟不上半消息的发送速度，最后end transaction就限流了（但是半消息发送没有限流），导致大量事务半消息发送成功但是commit操作全部丢失，这些消息最后都要回查，我在这里进行了修复：\r\n> \r\n> [areyouok@7393d5d](https://github.com/areyouok/rocketmq/commit/7393d5d2dc102403286da21d0cdc0403f9620662)\r\n> \r\n> 问题3：回查任务线程的ExecutorService的queue满2000以后，没有处理RejectedExecutionException，异常退出前renew了很多半消息，但是异常退出的时候没有处理移动位点。前面问题1、2导致了大量需要回查的半消息堆积，现在再加上问题3，这个时候集群就死全家了，会无限renew半消息。我们在生产环境下做压测，只进行了大约1个小时的压测，然后集群就陷入无限renew半消息的状态，过了两天3T的磁盘都要满了。我在这里进行了修复：\r\n>

is an interesting issue. I suppose we need more discussion on it.\r\nSince we use `brokerName `as the key of `brokerAddrTable`:\r\n`private final HashMap<String/* brokerName */, BrokerData> brokerAddrTable;`\r\nif two clusters have brokers with the same brokerName, when broker registers itself to nameserver, it will overwrite previous one and the previous one will overwrite it again by next registration. So the `brokerAddrTable `of namesever is uncertain and that is the reason the topic was created onto the cluster you didn't want.\r\nIMO, the questions @superheizai raised MAY need to be enhanced

the index file is successfully flushed, the message queue consumption file is not successfully flushed and the machine is crash, which may cause the message consumption queue file to be lost. But as long as the commitlog file is not lost, you can use RocketMQ's file recovery mechanism to recover lost message consumption queue files.\r\nIn RocketMQ's file recovery mechanism, there is a mechanism for file recovery for abnormal downtime. When the broker starts abnormally, during the file recovery process, RocketMQ forwards all the messages of the last valid file to the message consumption queue and index file, ensuring that no messages are lost, but also causes repeated consumption problems. Looking at RocketMQ As a whole design idea, RocketMQ guarantees that the message is not lost but does not guarantee that the message will not be repeatedly consumed. Therefore, the message consumer business party needs to realize the idempotent design of message consumption.\r\nTip: RocketMQ has two file recovery mechanisms, normal shutdown recovery and abnormal downtime recovery. The way to determine the exception is to create an abort empty file when the broker starts, and delete the file at the normal end. The next time you start the broker, if you find the abort file, it is considered abnormally down, otherwise, it is a normal shutdown.\r\n\r\n当索引文件刷盘成功，消息队列消费文件未刷盘成功且宕机时，会造成消息消费队列文件丢失的问题。但只要 commitlog 文件没有丢失，就可以利用 RocketMQ 的文件恢复机制，恢复丢失的消息消费队列文件。\r\n在 RocketMQ 的文件恢复机制中，有针对异常宕机进行文件恢复的机制。当 broker 异常启动，在文件恢复过程中，RocketMQ 会将最后一个有效文件的所有消息转发到消息消费队列和索引文件，确保不丢失消息，但同时也会带来重复消费的问题，纵观 RocketMQ 的整体设计思想，RocketMQ 保证消息不丢失但不保证消息不会重复消费，故消息消费业务方需要实现消息消费的幂等设计。\r\n提示：RocketMQ 有两种文件恢复机制，正常关机恢复和异常宕机恢复。判断异常的方式是在 broker启动的时候创建一个 abort 空文件，在正常结束的时候删掉这个文件。在下一次启动 broker 时，如果发现了 abort 文件，则认为是异常宕机，否则就是正常关机。\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/546688410/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/546761563","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/1555#issuecomment-546761563","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/1555","id":546761563,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0Njc2MTU2Mw==","user":{"login":"xiangwangcheng","id":8049014,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNDkwMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8049014?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangwangcheng","html_url":"https://github.com/xiangwangcheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangwangcheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangwangcheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangwangcheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangwangcheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangwangcheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangwangcheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangwangcheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangwangcheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangwangcheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-28T01:51:05Z","updated_at":"2019-10-28T01:51:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Maybe you have the ROCKETMQ_HOME configured wrong.

In minutes, for example, sampling is performed every 10 minutes, and the sampled data is stored in the `csListHour` container (representing hourly statistics). Up to 7 samples of data are stored in the container. Suppose the first sampling time is 12:00, then the 7th sampling time in the container is 13:10. If you call `computeStatsData()` to calculate, it will calculate the sum from 12:00 to 13:10. Tps and avgpt, obviously this **time span** is more reflective of the hourly statistics. If it is changed to the last sampled data and the previous sampled data is calculated, it reflects the statistical results from 13:00 to 13:10, and cannot reflect the statistical results of the **time span** in hours.\r\n\r\n`StatsItem`分别按秒、分钟、小时进行采样。以分钟为例，每隔 10 分钟会进行一次采样，采样的数据保存在`csListHour`容器中（表示每小时的统计数据）容器中最多保存 7 个采样数据。假设第一次采样的时间为 12：00，那么容器中第 7 次采样的时间为 13：10，如果此时调用`computeStatsData()`进行计算，会计算 12：00 到 13：10 的 sum、tps 和 avgpt，显然这个**时间跨度**是更能反映每小时的统计结果的。如果改成最后一次采样数据和之前一次采样数据计算的话，反映的是 13：00 到 13：10
