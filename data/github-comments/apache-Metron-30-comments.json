Right now we only formally define a small number of the fields - ip_(src|dest)_(addr|port) etc to have the metron format, but I would argue things like nat_source_addr in this parser should follow the spirit of the convention.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/300798460/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/300804905","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/579#issuecomment-300804905","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/579","id":300804905,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMDgwNDkwNQ==","user":{"login":"ctramnitz","id":7656592,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NTY1OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7656592?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctramnitz","html_url":"https://github.com/ctramnitz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctramnitz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctramnitz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctramnitz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctramnitz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctramnitz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctramnitz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctramnitz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctramnitz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctramnitz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-11T14:22:38Z","updated_at":"2017-05-11T14:22:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I agree to both of your points, defining it with the final name from the beginning would be more efficient and we should come up with a more normalized and standardized field naming convention in general.\r\n\r\nHowever, the second part is something for all parsers, not just this one, so it's a little bit out of scope for this PR. In fact, this PR doesn't change the concept of the previous code, it just makes the \"intermediate\" field names more consistent by following the vendor documentation.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion would be to either merge this PR as-is or with one-time-definition of already defined Metron field names.

one).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/300804905/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/301143003","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/566#issuecomment-301143003","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/566","id":301143003,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMTE0MzAwMw==","user":{"login":"cestella","id":540359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella","html_url":"https://github.com/cestella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-12T17:51:35Z","updated_at":"2017-05-12T17:51:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"+1

There are also a lot of fields that exist in the bro documentation for a specific log type that are not on by default, but can be turned on.  I plan to step towards support of those fields with various PRs, but not do it all with this first stab unless it's strongly encouraged.\r\n\r\nThat said, I will do some more work on the unit and integration tests to get better coverage, as there most definitely may be some missing, optional fields which I didn't catch in the tests.\r\n\r\n@nickwallen Right, that makes sense.  In a minute I'll push out my first pass at the integration tests, and I'll take another look at the tests this coming week and fill in any of the gaps.  \r\n\r\nAs an aside, I explicitly did not add these new logs to the bro sensor-stub, but I would consider doing so at some point in the future.

Was this by design?\r\n\r\nI get the following exception thrown, which is the one that I added as a null check on key:\r\n```\r\nRunning org.apache.metron.pcap.integration.PcapTopologyIntegrationTest\r\nFormatting using clusterid: testClusterID\r\n2017-05-16 11:05:39 ERROR util:0 - Async loop died!\r\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Expected a key but none provided\r\n\tat org.apache.metron.spout.pcap.HDFSWriterCallback.apply(HDFSWriterCallback.java:121)\r\n\tat org.apache.storm.kafka.CallbackCollector.emit(CallbackCollector.java:59)\r\n\tat org.apache.storm.kafka.spout.KafkaSpoutStream.emit(KafkaSpoutStream.java:79)\r\n\tat org.apache.storm.kafka.spout.KafkaSpoutStreamsNamedTopics.emit(KafkaSpoutStreamsNamedTopics.java:101)\r\n\tat org.apache.storm.kafka.spout.KafkaSpout.emitTupleIfNotEmitted(KafkaSpout.java:280)\r\n\tat org.apache.storm.kafka.spout.KafkaSpout.emit(KafkaSpout.java:265)\r\n\tat org.apache.storm.kafka.spout.KafkaSpout.nextTuple(KafkaSpout.java:212)\r\n\tat org.apache.storm.daemon.executor$fn__6503$fn__6518$fn__6549.invoke(executor.clj:651)\r\n\tat org.apache.storm.util$async_loop$fn__554.invoke(util.clj:484)\r\n\tat clojure.lang.AFn.run(AFn.java:22)\r\n\tat java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)\r\n2017-05-16 11:05:39 ERROR executor:0 -\r\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Expected a key but none provided\r\n\tat org.apache.metron.spout.pcap.HDFSWriterCallback.apply(HDFSWriterCallback.java:121)\r\n\tat org.apache.storm.kafka.CallbackCollector.emit(CallbackCollector.java:59)\r\n\tat org.apache.storm.kafka.spout.KafkaSpoutStream.emit(KafkaSpoutStream.java:79)\r\n\tat org.apache.storm.kafka.spout.KafkaSpoutStreamsNamedTopics.emit(KafkaSpoutStreamsNamedTopics.java:101)\r\n\tat org.apache.storm.kafka.spout.KafkaSpout.emitTupleIfNotEmitted(KafkaSpout.java:280)\r\n\tat org.apache.storm.kafka.spout.KafkaSpout.emit(KafkaSpout.java:265)\r\n\tat org.apache.storm.kafka.spout.KafkaSpout.nextTuple(KafkaSpout.java:212)\r\n\tat org.apache.storm.daemon.executor$fn__6503$fn__6518$fn__6549.invoke(executor.clj:651)\r\n\tat org.apache.storm.util$async_loop$fn__554.invoke(util.clj:484)\r\n\tat clojure.lang.AFn.run(AFn.java:22)\r\n\tat java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)\r\n2017-05-16 11:05:39 ERROR util:0 - Halting process: (\"Worker died\")\r\njava.lang.RuntimeException: (\"Worker died\")\r\n\tat org.apache.storm.util$exit_process_BANG_.doInvoke(util.clj:341)\r\n\tat clojure.lang.RestFn.invoke(RestFn.java:423)\r\n\tat org.apache.storm.daemon.worker$fn__7172$fn__7173.invoke(worker.clj:761)\r\n\tat org.apache.storm.daemon.executor$mk_executor_data$fn__6388$fn__6389.invoke(executor.clj:275)\r\n\tat org.apache.storm.util$async_loop$fn__554.invoke(util.clj:494)\r\n\tat clojure.lang.AFn.run(AFn.java:22)\r\n\tat java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I attempt to view the PCAP file with the PcapInspector in the IDE, I get this exception.\r\n```\r\nException in thread \"main\" java.io.IOException: wrong key class: org.apache.hadoop.io.LongWritable is not class org.apache.hadoop.io.IntWritable\r\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.io.SequenceFile$Reader.next(SequenceFile.java:2254)\r\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.io.SequenceFile$Reader.next(SequenceFile.java:2306)\r\n\tat org.apache.metron.utils.PcapInspector.main(PcapInspector.java:142)\r\n\r\nProcess finished with exit code 1\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/301854381/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/301874297","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/585#issuecomment-301874297","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/585","id":301874297,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMTg3NDI5Nw==","user":{"login":"cestella","id":540359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella","html_url":"https://github.com/cestella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-16T18:33:30Z","updated_at":"2017-05-16T18:33:30Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@mmiklavc it depends on which test case you're talking about.  We have two modes of operation in the pcap topology and 2 test cases in the integration test and these are defined by the flux property `kafka.pcap.ts_scheme`.  These modes define the deserialization logic used in the topology to convert kafka key/values to bytes suitable for writing to HDFS:\r\n* `FROM_PACKET`: which expects a fully-formed packet (with headers) and parses the packet and extracts the timestamp from the value.  This is a legacy mode, which functioned with pycapa prior to rewriting.  We should eventually deprecate this and remove it.  This is associated with the `FromPacketDeserializer`\r\n* `FROM_KEY` : which expects raw data and a timestamp from the key.  This is by far the dominant mode of operation and the one you will see in `pycapa` or `fastcapa`.  This is associated with the `FromKeyDeserializer`\r\n\r\nIt appears that you are doing the null check in the `HDFSWriterCallback`.  I would recommend doing this null check in `FromKeyDeserializer` as a null key is not an illegal state for the `FromPacketDeserializer`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/301874297/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/301876154","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/588#issuecomment-301876154","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/588","id":301876154,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMTg3NjE1NA==","user":{"login":"justinleet","id":5077341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzczNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5077341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet","html_url":"https://github.com/justinleet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-16T18:40:05Z","updated_at":"2017-05-16T18:40:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm +1.
