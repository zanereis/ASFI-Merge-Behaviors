I have tried the Lua version of  https://github.com/jcjohnson/neural-style/tree/master/models for producing neural style pictures, and it worked nicely. The lua version loads the caffe model, so mxnet can load the same model too from model.sh and simply replicate the producing script from Lua to python with mxnet.\n\nP.S. since mxnet's unique advantage is memory saving, if later on we can have an mxnet version with slightly simplified network for speed boost, we may be able to shorten the producing time within 1 min. Currently it needs about 2-3 min of producing a 512px image from a GTX 960 using 3 GB memory, if 1024px, my poor GTX 960 goes die.
