We should not be applying these predicates globally across the partitions. For example p1[startOffset=1000, endOffset=2000], p2[1500,5000], So in this case, always better to consider the offsets per partition. But in test cases, I am not partition specific predicates.\r\n\r\n2. Good to see that you have considered multiple scenarios for *kafkaMsgTimestamp* predicates and the above point will also applicable for *kafkaMsgTimestamp* as well. We might need to consider per partition specific *kafkaMsgTimestamp* predicates.  But this might cause the issues, as * offsetsForTimes* method is a blocking and it can block indefinitely if user provides wrong partition.\r\n\r\nCan you please clarify above two comments? \r\n   \r\n    ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/391372423/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/391413129","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1272#issuecomment-391413129","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1272","id":391413129,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MTQxMzEyOQ==","user":{"login":"abhidotravi","id":9062901,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjI5MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9062901?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhidotravi","html_url":"https://github.com/abhidotravi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhidotravi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhidotravi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhidotravi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhidotravi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhidotravi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhidotravi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhidotravi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhidotravi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhidotravi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-23T16:31:06Z","updated_at":"2018-05-23T16:31:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@akumarb2010 - user has the flexibility to provide conditions w.r.t any of the metadata fields (`kafkaMsgOffset`, `kafkaMsgTimestamp`, `kafkaPartitionId`). The conditions on these metadata fields is pushed down and translated to a **Scan Spec** which is a collection of partition specific scan spec.\r\n\r\nLet us consider the following Scan spec before pushdown.\r\n\r\n```\r\nKafkaPartitionScanSpec(topicName=TopicTable, partitionId=0, startOffset=0, endOffset=1500)\r\nKafkaPartitionScanSpec(topicName=TopicTable, partitionId=1, startOffset=2000, endOffset=3000)\r\nKafkaPartitionScanSpec(topicName=TopicTable, partitionId=2, startOffset=25, endOffset=3500)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the predicates are only on `kafkaMsgOffset` (for example `SELECT * FROM kafka.LogEventStream WHERE kafkaMsgOffset >= 1000 AND kafkaMsgOffset < 2000)`, this will apply the pushdown to ALL partitions within a topic. If there is a partition where such offsets do not exist (either the offsets have expired or messages for those offsets are yet to be produced), then such partition will not be scanned.\r\n\r\nThe scan spec in this case would be\r\n```\r\nKafkaPartitionScanSpec(topicName=TopicTable, partitionId=0, startOffset=1000, endOffset=1500)\r\nKafkaPartitionScanSpec(topicName=TopicTable, partitionId=1, startOffset=1200, endOffset=2000)\r\nKafkaPartitionScanSpec(topicName=TopicTable, partitionId=2, startOffset=1000, endOffset=2000)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not sure if we should introduce per partition semantics in the query and would prefer keeping it generic. The *scenario you mentioned in (1)* can still be addressed with following predicates\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT * FROM kafka.LogEventStream WHERE (kafkaPartitionId = 1 AND kafkaMsgOffset >= 1000 AND kafkaMsgOffset < 2000) OR (kafkaPartitionId = 2 AND kafkaMsgOffset >= 1500 AND kafkaMsgOffset < 5000)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe scan spec in this case would be as follows (notice that there is no `partitionId 0`).\r\n```\r\nKafkaPartitionScanSpec(topicName=TopicTable, partitionId=1, startOffset=1200, endOffset=2000)\r\nKafkaPartitionScanSpec(topicName=TopicTable, partitionId=2, startOffset=1000, endOffset=2000)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis applies to conditions on `kafkaMsgTimestamp` as well. Most common use case is - user wants to view messages that belong to a specific time window (not very specific about the partition). This can be done by having predicates on `kafkaMsgTimestamp` alone without having to specify `kafkaPartitionId`.\r\n```\r\nSELECT * FROM kafka.LogEventStream WHERE kafkaMsgTimestamp > 1527092007199 AND kafkaMsgOffset < 1527092031717\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever user can also specify conditions specific to partition - *scenario mentioned in (2)*\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT * FROM kafka.LogEventStream WHERE (kafkaPartitionId = 1 AND kafkaMsgTimestamp > 1527092007199 AND kafkaMsgOffset < 1527092031717) OR (kafkaPartitionId = 2 AND kafkaMsgTimestamp > 1527092133501)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would also avoid the problem of calling `offsetsForTimes` on non-existing partitions. Since such partitions are filtered out from the scan spec.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/391413129/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/391427723","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1272#issuecomment-391427723","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1272","id":391427723,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MTQyNzcyMw==","user":{"login":"akumarb2010","id":1168266,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjgyNjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1168266?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akumarb2010","html_url":"https://github.com/akumarb2010","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akumarb2010/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akumarb2010/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akumarb2010/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akumarb2010/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akumarb2010/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akumarb2010/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akumarb2010/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akumarb2010/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akumarb2010/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-23T17:13:35Z","updated_at":"2018-05-23T17:15:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@aravi5  Thanks for providing all the details.

I am unable to find any use case, where we can take the range of offsets and apply on all partitions. In most of the scenario's they may not be valid offsets.\r\n\r\nIMHO, we should only apply predicate pushdown where we have exact scan specs. \r\n\r\nFor example, in case below scenario, we can apply the predicates without any issues.\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT * FROM kafka.LogEventStream WHERE (kafkaPartitionId = 1 AND kafkaMsgOffset > 1000 AND kafkaMsgOffset < 2000) OR (kafkaPartitionId = 2 AND kafkaMsgOffset > 4000)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd this way, we can use this predicate pushdown feature for external checkpointing mechanism.\r\n\r\nAnd coming to time stamps, my point is, in case of invalid *partitionId*, query might block indefinitely with this feature. Where as, without this feature, we will return empty results.\r\n\r\nIt will be great if you can add few test cases with invalid partitions like below (Assuming partition 100 doesn't exist)\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT * FROM kafka.LogEventStream WHERE (kafkaPartitionId = 100 AND kafkaMsgTimestamp > 1527092007199)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/391427723/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
