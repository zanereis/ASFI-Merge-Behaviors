Providing an alternative `SecureRandom` instance could help (especially if it uses the non-blocking `/dev/urandom` vs `/dev/random`), but there would still be the problem of thread contention due to the `synchronized` nature of `getBytes`.\r\n\r\nA naive implementation I did to at least get the issue out of the way for now is:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nnew java.util.UUID(ThreadLocalRandom.current.nextLong, ThreadLocalRandom.current.nextLong)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe randomness is not cryptographically secure, yes. We are namespacing our ActivationIds though, so the domain of collision is significantly smaller than having them globally namespaced. I'm not too much an expert in that area though to judge wether the randomness provided by `ThreadLocalRandom` is sufficient. It for sure does fix the contention and blocking problem though.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/330587501/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/330593692","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/2462#issuecomment-330593692","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2462","id":330593692,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMDU5MzY5Mg==","user":{"login":"jessealva","id":7730456,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MzA0NTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7730456?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessealva","html_url":"https://github.com/jessealva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessealva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessealva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessealva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessealva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessealva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessealva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessealva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessealva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessealva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-19T16:21:18Z","updated_at":"2017-09-19T16:21:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"ugh, not clean, looking into this again\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/330593692/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/330595585","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/2778#issuecomment-330595585","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2778","id":330595585,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMDU5NTU4NQ==","user":{"login":"dubee","id":11520887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIwODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11520887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee","html_url":"https://github.com/dubee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-19T16:27:52Z","updated_at":"2017-09-19T16:27:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"PG3 1107 ⏳ ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/330595585/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/330598088","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/2531#issuecomment-330598088","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2531","id":330598088,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMDU5ODA4OA==","user":{"login":"tysonnorris","id":1638396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzgzOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1638396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tysonnorris","html_url":"https://github.com/tysonnorris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tysonnorris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tysonnorris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tysonnorris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tysonnorris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tysonnorris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tysonnorris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tysonnorris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tysonnorris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tysonnorris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-19T16:36:24Z","updated_at":"2017-09-19T16:36:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vvraskin to your points: \r\n1 - in controller immediately, no. In controller in the near future, yes, e.g. in a mesos case we will need to use either ClusterSingleton or MemberEvent to designate a leader; we will also need to share some state within the cluster (may be able to leverage SharedDataService, or else directly use DistributedData)\r\n2 - my concern with downing is the case where nodes are down, and not coming back (or not coming back with the same id). In this case, docs indicate that new members cannot become \"up\", etc, till the unreachable node is downed. So regardless of whether traffic is routed to an unreachable node, if clustering usage is affected by having an unreachable, but NOT downed node, then there will be other types of problems (e.g. can replacement nodes be added? can the cluster size be grown?). Separately from needing the ability to cause nodes to be downed, the semantics of determining down vs *temp* unreachable will be different in a cluster manager like mesos/kube, similar to the semantics of determining seed nodes.

Given that the cluster is now started from within the `LoadBalancerService`, it should be good enough for near future extensions. \r\n2. I think you mean the case of network partitioning in between two controllers when the traffic could still flow between nginx and that controller. In this case we could probably set the hard auto-downing timeout - 5 mins, mark it as unreachable and the broken node could join the cluster again. (back to the point of @bwmcadams with a measured value, however, this is just a high enough number). But even without this timeout, the node should become green again, once the partitioning is resolved. \r\nHowever, if you speak about some other hypothetical cases when the network is fine, but the node is unreachable und not downed. Then restarting the node should automatically unregister it from the cluster and give it a chance to join it again (actor should signal to the cluster upon going down).\r\n\r\nI think we are a bit far way from the initial discussion we have started upon the changes requested on this PR.

I think the Redis client API is a better match for the needed function than Zookeeper's.   It might not be the final solution, but it allows us to make forward progress.  Note that the persistent store is not dynamically used if the deployment provides suggested invokerIds (current default behavior). \r\n\r\nI've done some updates and squashed down to a single commit again.  Since the approach has changed quite a bit during the review process, I'm inling the updated commit comment here to make it easier to see what this PR is actually doing now.\r\n\r\n----\r\n    First stage of adding support for dynamic invoker id assignment\r\n    \r\n    Add a handshake between the invoker and controller during invoker\r\n    startup to allow the controller an opportunity to dynamically assign\r\n    the invokerId (the topic to which the invoker listens to accept work).\r\n    The invoker provides an identifying name for itself and optionally a\r\n    suggested invokerId to the controller via the invokerReg topic of the\r\n    messaging provider. The controller responds with an assigned invokerID\r\n    using a topic derived from the provided invoker name.  After receiving\r\n    its invokerId, the rest of invoker startup proceeds as before.\r\n    \r\n    To support different deployment scenarios, both the name and the\r\n    suggested invokerId may be provided externally to the invoker. This\r\n    supports two deployment modes:\r\n      1. A completely static assignment of invokerIds to invokers when the\r\n         deployment specifies the suggested invokerId. This is the default\r\n         option for this PR and matches the prior behavior of the system.\r\n      2. If the deployment provides an invoker name, but not a suggested\r\n         invokerId, then we get a dynamically assigned but stable\r\n         invokerIds. For example, the invoker name could be the IP address\r\n         or hostname of the invoker's host or the nodeName of the kube\r\n         worker node.\r\n    A third option, in which the deployment provides neither the name nor\r\n    the suggested invokerId is possible, but is currently trapped as a\r\n    configuration error.  This is treated as configuration error to avoid\r\n    an explosion of invokerIds (topics) in the presence of frequent\r\n    invoker instance restarts.\r\n    \r\n    Option 2 depends on persisting the state for the dynamic invoker id\r\n    assignment protocol to support controller restarts and\r\n    multiple controllers. For the purposes of this PR, we use the Redis\r\n    instance stated for the apigateway as the persistent store since the\r\n    Redis API is a good match for the needed operations.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/330924558/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/330931873","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/2531#issuecomment-330931873","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2531","id":330931873,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMDkzMTg3Mw==","user":{"login":"ddragosd","id":541933,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MTkzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/541933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddragosd","html_url":"https://github.com/ddragosd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddragosd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddragosd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddragosd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddragosd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddragosd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddragosd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddragosd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddragosd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddragosd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-20T17:59:44Z","updated_at":"2017-09-20T17:59:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vvraskin how are nodes downed ?
