I was testing 4.5 today and the awsapi service did not work for me, after wasting almost 2 hours to make it work, I tried ec2stack which worked out of the box.

I’ll keep this open and hope to merge it next week but am interested in merge it now to avoid rebasing efforts again. If ec2stack will get its own git repo like docs repos or cloudmonkey - does it matter if we merge this now or next week and will this block 4.6 release management?\n> \n> Nothing technical, just a better process in my view.
