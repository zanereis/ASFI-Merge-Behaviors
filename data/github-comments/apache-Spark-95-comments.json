 this is a great question.\n\nThe answer there is ether a bug in sbt or I'm missing something in the SparkBuild.scala.\n\nIn the Flume 1.4.0 pom.xml there is a dependency on thrift but the version is declared with a property and that property is defined in a profile.  I'm not sure if the issue related to the property or the profile or the combination, but sbt does not use the value of the thirft version property and I get the following exception. \n\nsbt.ResolveException: unresolved dependency: org.apache.thrift#libthrift;${thrift.version}: not found \n\nMaven works just fine so I left that as is.  \n\nSo with my limited understand of sbt and why it was craping out.  I decided to exclude the thrift dependency in Flume 1.4.0 and place it in the SparkBuild.scala file.  \n\nI'm open to any and all help here.  I don't know enough about sbt to know why it is having trouble with this.\n\nSide note, sbt works fine with Flume 1.3.0.  This is because in Flume 1.3.0 the thrift version is hard coded in the Flume pom.xml.

I'm not even sure how Flume would honor that requirement without profiles.  \n\nAlso I figured it would be good to have Flume 1.4.0 in Spark 1.0, because Flume 1.4.0 is the most commonly used Flume out there and it has some really cool functionality I would like to add to the FlumeStream like compression and encryption.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/41319131/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/41320353","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/529#issuecomment-41320353","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/529","id":41320353,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMzIwMzUz","user":{"login":"AmplabJenkins","id":4031291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzEyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4031291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/AmplabJenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-24T19:16:05Z","updated_at":"2014-04-24T19:16:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Merged build finished.

Thrift has a Hadoop 1 and Hadoop 2 version, but usually you deploy those as separate artifacts. The Hadoop 1 profile is the default, which specifies thrift 0.7.0, but you have to parse profiles to know that. I think it would have been better to set 0.7.0 as the version outside a profile. But I think that's why SBT doesn't get it.\n\nNext I note that flume is telling us it wants to use 0.7.0 with Hadoop 1 and 0.8.0 with Hadoop 2. Ideally we just get away with 0.8.0 for both and not try to version this independently.\n\nYou have the SBT build using 0.8.0 but I bet that if you ran mvn dependency:tree you'd find that the Maven build is actually pulling in 0.7.0, given that it's the 'default'.\n\n(But wait, there's more. In Examples, Hive 0.12 wants thrift 0.9.0! But that's irrelevant, it's not a dependency on external.)\n\nSuggest that the Maven build force thrift 0.8.0 too and document it. It can be `<scope>runtime</scope>`. I think that's pretty tidy, and at least this is contained to particular leaf module.\n\nOnce Hadoop 1 and yarn alpha support and such go away, some of this jar hell will too. And maybe when there's one build of reference. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/41323534/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/41323794","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/507#issuecomment-41323794","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/507","id":41323794,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMzIzNzk0","user":{"login":"tmalaska","id":1946016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1946016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmalaska","html_url":"https://github.com/tmalaska","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmalaska/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmalaska/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmalaska/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmalaska/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmalaska/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmalaska/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmalaska/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmalaska/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmalaska/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-24T19:50:23Z","updated_at":"2014-04-24T19:50:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@srowen yes I agree.
