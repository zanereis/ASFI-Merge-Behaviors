When target worker is down, the source worker should be aware of this and should not crash.\n   The approach we use here is as follows:\n   a. when target worker is down\n   b. the source worker will begin reconnect (It can retry upto \"storm.messaging.netty.max_retries\" times)\n   c. source worker know that target worker is down(by watching zookeeper nodes)\n   d. source worker call target client.close(), client.close() now will set the flag closing as true asyncly, and this will break the reconnection at step b. \n   e. reconnection aborted. No exception thrown.\n2. When target worker is down, the data sending to other target worker should not be blocked.\n   The approach we currently using is to drop messages when connection to target worker is not available.\n3. There is a side effect of solution in 2. During the course of topology setup, will we drop the messages if some target worker connection is establishing?\n   For this problem, we will now wait the connection to be ready, before bringing up spout/bolts during worker startup.

When target worker is down, the data sending to other target worker should not be blocked.<br/>\n    The approach we currently using is to drop messages when connection to target worker is not available.</p>\n\n<p>    3.

for heartbeats of size 1). The reason is that the size of the _pendingWrites queue is Config.TOPOLOGY_SHELLBOLT_MAX_PENDING which by its name is the number of real tuples to retrieve from the disruptor queue. We set it to 1 to optimize for shortest latency... which would cause this thread to block.... which means you cannot share this thread between bolts event if you wanted too... which we need to think if this is an issue or not. A stronger argument in favor of a priority queue for heartbeats is that the rate of heartbeat messages will not be skewed by the length of the queue. </p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612502361/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612502363","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4355#issuecomment-2612502363","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4355","id":2612502363,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI1MDIzNjM=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-24T07:58:17Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T13:12:59Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=githubbot\">githubbot</a>:</i>\n<p>Github user HeartSaVioR commented on a diff in the pull request:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/286#discussion_r19326747\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/286#discussion_r19326747</a></p>\n\n<p>    &#8212; Diff: storm-core/src/jvm/backtype/storm/task/ShellBolt.java &#8212;<br/>\n    @@ -305,4 +283,95 @@ private void die(Throwable exception) </p>\n{\n System.exit(11);\n     }\n<p> }<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +    private class BoltHeartbeatTimerTask extends TimerTask {<br/>\n    +private ShellBolt bolt;<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +public BoltHeartbeatTimerTask(ShellBolt bolt) </p>\n{\n    +    this.bolt = bolt;\n    +}\n<p>    +<br/>\n    +@Override<br/>\n    +public void run() {<br/>\n    +    long currentTimeMillis = System.currentTimeMillis();<br/>\n    +    long lastHeartbeat = getLastHeartbeat();<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +    LOG.debug(\"BOLT - current time : {}, last heartbeat : {}, worker timeout (ms) : {}\",<br/>\n    +    currentTimeMillis, lastHeartbeat, workerTimeoutMills);<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +    if (currentTimeMillis - lastHeartbeat > workerTimeoutMills) </p>\n{\n    +bolt.die(new RuntimeException(\"subprocess heartbeat timeout\"));\n    +    }\n<p>    +<br/>\n    +    String genId = Long.toString(_rand.nextLong());<br/>\n    +    try {<br/>\n    +_pendingWrites.put(createHeartbeatBoltMessage(genId));<br/>\n    &#8212; End diff &#8211;</p>\n\n<p>    @itaifrenkel Oh, I see.
