However, I do see there are no unit tests currently setup for the alert details component. If the scope of setting up these tests is very time consuming, I think you should create a separate JIRA to cover this component with unit tests. That way, we aren't delaying the bug fix getting into master.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/457513841/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/457594897","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1322#issuecomment-457594897","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1322","id":457594897,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NzU5NDg5Nw==","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-25T14:45:34Z","updated_at":"2019-01-25T14:45:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 Thanks for the updates.

I agree, anything based on a time will eventually be unreliable at some point. In this case, I am overriding a value that acts as a safety because Cypress will re-run assertions over and over until they are true or reach the timeout value specified. Indeed, it would be better if there was a way for Cypress to determine when to exit an assertion that wasn't time-based, but I'm guessing they chose to do things this way because of the nature of e2e testing in a browser. For example, in the case where the UI builds fine but contains an error that prevents part of the page from rendering, Cypress will re-run an assertion on a non-existing element over and over. Without a timeout value, it will do so infinitely.

However the issue you're struggling with is critical, I respectfully think it's out of the scope of this PR. \r\n\r\nWhen it comes to removing comments (and adding as well!!), the app deals with HTTP requests which are not organized properly. When you successfully removed or added new comments, the server responses with the fresh new list of comments attached to the given alert. But if you're fast, adding/removing a bunch of comments then immediately closing and opening the comments pane again could cause certain issues. The problem is that the API endpoints for the deletion/addition returns with a list of comments and when you open the pane, it also returns the list of comments and the two are not necessarily the same at a certain point of time. They're not synced yet.\r\n\r\nLong story short, the current design and the implementation is not prepared for this kind of user quickness, the solution for this is not trivial and needs to have a further discussion for sure how to deal with it.\r\n\r\nIf you don't think otherwise, I would open a Jira ticket about the aforementioned syncing issue and ship the patch in a different PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/462282323/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/462292448","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1307#issuecomment-462292448","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1307","id":462292448,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MjI5MjQ0OA==","user":{"login":"sardell","id":7304869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMDQ4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7304869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell","html_url":"https://github.com/sardell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-11T11:14:54Z","updated_at":"2019-02-11T11:14:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ruffle1986 I see.

That charset PR should help fix a lot of them. I believe most of the other error prone issues are raw types resulting from our use of json-simple.

I thought you were saying we will never enforce checkstyle checks like javadoc.  You're just saying \"hey, we have a lot of work to do before we can enforce checkstyle across the board.\"   And that makes sense to me.\r\n\r\nI was just curious if there was a way to enforce specific checks, per project.  But if you think that is not possible, that is fine.
