Gremlin server complained that `ReservedKeysVerificationStrategy` Java class is not found.\r\n\r\nLater I found that GraphSON sends Bytecode's `withStrategies` source without fully qualified class name, it simply sends `g:ReservedKeysVerificationStrategy` type based on JavaScript class name and, I guess (I did not research respective Java code), server side’s GraphSON implementation knows what Java class should be used. Thus, I got it that GraphBinary should send FQCN instead, and every `TraversalStrategy` of gremlin-javascript already provides respective `fqcn` field.\r\n\r\nI got the next issue after that, Gremlin server was not erroring for reserved keys as the test expected. And I found that `ReservedKeysVerificationStrategy` class in gremlin-javascript has `fqcn=org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.process.traversal.strategy.verification.EdgeLabelVerificationStrategy`. GraphSON does not use this field, that’s why the integration test is okay for it. I changed it to `org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.process.traversal.strategy.verification.ReservedKeysVerificationStrategy` and the integration test passed.\r\n\r\nAs long as this typo affects GraphBinary only, i.e. the new feature, I could integrate this typo fix within this PR. But, if you want to get it fixed as a separate PR then let me know, I’m going to keep it fixed localy meanwhile.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1133940276/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1134778371","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1645#issuecomment-1134778371","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1645","id":1134778371,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc5Do1gD","user":{"login":"dependabot[bot]","id":49699333,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDk2OTkzMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/29110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/dependabot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-23T14:52:46Z","updated_at":"2022-05-23T14:52:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Superseded by #1666.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1134778371/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1134800749","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1666#issuecomment-1134800749","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1666","id":1134800749,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc5Do69t","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-23T15:11:33Z","updated_at":"2022-05-23T15:11:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1666?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) Report\n> Merging [#1666](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1666?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (3d33351) into [3.5-dev](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/tinkerpop/commit/aa2820bc4cd223e97cb814e7edf2d8a0007ade5c?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (aa2820b) will **not change** coverage.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n```diff\n@@           Coverage Diff            @@\n##           3.5-dev    #1666   +/-   ##\n========================================\n  Coverage    63.41%   63.41%           \n========================================\n  Files           23       23           \n  Lines         3545     3545           \n========================================\n  Hits          2248     2248           \n  Misses        1123     1123           \n  Partials       174      174           \n```\n\n\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1666?src=pr&el=continue&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation).\n> **Legend** -

the main pom.xml, then the dependency will be grabbed based on the version specified, and therefore satisfies the dependency requirement of the individual pom.xml when those dependencies are resolved.\r\n\r\nHowever, if someone were to modularly use the individual maven projects as a standalone, I had a concern that then the dependency would not enforce a non-vulnerable versioning, hence why I added it.\r\n\r\nIf someone can confirm that this is not an issue, then I think removing the added `<version`> to the individual pom is

As this may be considered a breaking change, I added a change-log entry, are there additional docs I should edit?\r\n\r\nbreaking changes are typically documented in the Upgrade Documentation so that we can call attention to important changes more easily with greater detail than the CHANGELOG - it is probably worth adding an item to say that this parameter no longer does anything and that you would want to call `open()` explicitly to \"connect on startup\". also, if it is a breaking change, there should be a \"breaking\" label on the JIRA. finally, i would assume the deprecation to be removed on merge to master for 3.7.0, so perhaps you should consider a follow-on PR to get rid of the warning message and parameter all together on that branch.\r\n\r\nseparately, there is a merge commit in the history. could you please remove that? other than that VOTE
