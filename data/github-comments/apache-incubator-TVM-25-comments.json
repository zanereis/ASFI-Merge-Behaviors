If it is a subfunction in a function or a method in a class, an error will occur.\r\n    - `args` is the argument list of this function.\r\n    - `binds` the same as the `binds` argument in `tvm.lower`\r\n    - `parse` parses the function and returns the parsed IR, and the parser instance. The parser instance will later support some hybrid programming model.\r\n    - `tvm.contrib.pyfrontend.lower` is something like `tvm.lower`\r\n    - The IR generated by `lower` is compatible with tvm.build, so we can get LLVM JIT easily\r\n\r\n- Syntax supported:\r\n    - **Main arithmetic ops: ** four arithmetic ops and bitwise ops are supported. Math functions have not been implemented.\r\n    - **Loops: ** only two kinds of loops are supported (the loop bound can be variable but the step **MUST** be 1):\r\n````python\r\nfor i in range(5):\r\nfor i in range(0, n):\r\n````\r\n    - **Variables: ** because there is no mutable variables in HalideIR, all the variables will be replaced by a buffer with size 1.\r\n    - **Annotation: ** we can use `with` to annotate loops, but we need to add decorator, `tvm.contrib.pyfrontend.py_fronted`, before the functions to ensure the sematic; I am not sure if it is a good idea: the decorator forcely put the class `Unrolled` into the global scope\r\n\r\n- Summary\r\nTo sum up, code that uses `pyfrontend` should roughly look like:\r\n````python\r\n@tvm.contrib.pyfronted.py_frontend\r\ndef foo(a, b):\r\n    sum = 0.0\r\n    with Unrolled as i:\r\n        for i in range(5):\r\n            sum = sum + (a[i] * a[i] if i % 2 == 0 else a[i] * a[i] + 1)\r\n    b[0] = a[i]\r\n\r\na = tvm.placeholder((5, ), dtype='float32', name='a')\r\nb = tvm.placeholder((1, ), dtype='float32', name='b')\r\ntvm.contrib.pyfrontend.parse(foo, [a, b])\r\n````","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/390380860/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/390417476","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/1093#issuecomment-390417476","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1093","id":390417476,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MDQxNzQ3Ng==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-19T16:48:34Z","updated_at":"2018-05-19T16:48:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"move

My interest is focus on `opencl` as a final target. I'm good with the major network and the nnvm part ( dmlc/nnvm#482 ), since it can already run on top of GPU. But when implemented with `ir_builder` in `topi`, is it possible to target `opencl` or `cuda` ? How can I implement reuse the code in `ir_builder` for `opencl` ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/391920563/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/391955262","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/1179#issuecomment-391955262","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1179","id":391955262,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MTk1NTI2Mg==","user":{"login":"acmore","id":1159490,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTk0OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1159490?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmore","html_url":"https://github.com/acmore","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmore/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmore/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmore/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmore/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmore/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmore/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmore/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmore/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmore/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-25T06:29:34Z","updated_at":"2018-05-25T06:29:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sorry, I did a force push...
