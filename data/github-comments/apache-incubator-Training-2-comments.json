Justin,\r\ncurrently the goal is to initiate the project with a focus on \"semi-automation\" of documentation tasks. \r\nMost importantly, the prompts, the prompt templates, and the indexing logic will be developed and applied to small data sets, such as the docu-repos of several ASF projects. \r\n\r\nNow we have two options: \r\n(A) Creation of content, such as README or quickstart tutorials, or executive summaries etc.\r\n(B) Automatic inspection of the content, using the \"reference questions\" as defined in the tool - and based on the result, a human editor can update the original documents in such a way that the questions can be answered. I\r\n\r\nIn case (B) no generated content will be published in a software repository, it is just temporary information which allows \r\nquality assessments and improvements in a standardized semi-automatic way.\r\n\r\nI understand that following the path towards (A) is still a risk. Hence, the goal is the creation of tool which can be configured to use multiple LLMs, starting from public offerings to personal deployments (such as OpenAI model in Azure self hosted by a user vs. the fully managed OpenAI model which is used right now.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-training/issues/comments/1660123868/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-training/issues/comments/1660127491","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-training/pull/87#issuecomment-1660127491","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-training/issues/87","id":1660127491,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCj-__s5i84kD","user":{"login":"kamir","id":1241122,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDExMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1241122?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamir","html_url":"https://github.com/kamir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamir/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-01T11:30:14Z","updated_at":"2023-08-01T11:30:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Is
