Is this a problem or is this simply expected behaviour - ie. should the user realize that there will be a difference between UTF-16 and UTF-16BE encoding and the resulting hash?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/419574743/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/419611774","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2980#issuecomment-419611774","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2980","id":419611774,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxOTYxMTc3NA==","user":{"login":"alopresto","id":798465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODQ2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/798465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto","html_url":"https://github.com/alopresto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-08T04:24:15Z","updated_at":"2018-09-08T04:24:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for discovering this @thenatog .

I'm still in the process of reviewing but one thing that concerns me is where we've identified Service Only in the scenarios above. Currently (before the PR) the Enable case we allow the user to specify if they want to enable just this service or this service and all components that reference it (including other services and their referencing components). During the Disable case, we require that the user disables this service and all referencing components. This is because the referencing components require this service's availability to continue running.\r\n\r\nThe issue that we're hitting now is that a user with permissions outlined above with Service Only will be able to Enable this service but will be unable to subsequently disable it. Because of this, I'm wondering if we need to be even more strict to prevent this cases via the UI. I don't think its too restrictive as this is more of a corner case. The more common use case here will be granting operators permissions to the read policies and operation policies for these components.\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/420696256/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/420748196","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2999#issuecomment-420748196","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2999","id":420748196,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMDc0ODE5Ng==","user":{"login":"josephxsxn","id":2395496,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzOTU0OTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2395496?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/josephxsxn","html_url":"https://github.com/josephxsxn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josephxsxn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josephxsxn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josephxsxn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josephxsxn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josephxsxn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josephxsxn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josephxsxn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josephxsxn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josephxsxn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-12T18:19:22Z","updated_at":"2018-09-12T18:19:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for submitting this documentation change.

I've been swamped with other urgent tasks. Will come back to continue reviewing this once those get done.\r\n\r\nBTW, do you have any suggestion to convert string values into nominal numeric values, things like categories such as log level (ERR, INFO, WARN ... etc).\r\nI found this web page useful to think about data types for machine learning and deep learning.\r\nhttps://towardsdatascience.com/7-data-types-a-better-way-to-think-about-data-types-for-machine-learning-939fae99a689\r\n\r\nI wonder how we can implement such conversions at NiFi. I still think NiFi needs the capability to convert general data into numeric vector so that DL4J can be applied. Without that these processors are hard to use.\r\n\r\nI briefly took a look at datavec project, but it seems it depends on Spark to execute such transformation. I envision NiFi doing such task within its data flow so that it can use DeepLearning model directly against incoming streaming data.\r\nhttps://deeplearning4j.org/datavec\r\n\r\nAnyone can join this review, please do so.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/421245514/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/421292558","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3003#issuecomment-421292558","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3003","id":421292558,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMTI5MjU1OA==","user":{"login":"mohitgargk","id":1259955,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTk5NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1259955?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohitgargk","html_url":"https://github.com/mohitgargk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohitgargk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohitgargk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohitgargk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohitgargk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohitgargk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohitgargk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohitgargk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohitgargk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohitgargk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-14T09:30:42Z","updated_at":"2018-09-14T09:30:42Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Retrying CI again.
