`@Reference(timeout=2s)`（缺省值 1s）。\r\n个人也遇到了类似问题，跟你写的demo差不多。\r\n第1次可能timeout，但因为retries=2（默认值），第2次重试却能正常响应。\r\n\r\n备注：\r\n1. provider 的业务方法内 `sleep(1s)`\r\n2. consumer `@Reference(timeout = 1s)`\r\n\r\n理论上来说，始终都是timeout，但是实际是第2+次可以成功。\r\n这跟dubbo的timeout检测机制有关。\r\n\r\n重试机制代码：\r\n- `FailoverClusterInvoker#doInvoke(Invocation, List<Invoker<T>>, LoadBalance )`\r\n\r\ntimeout 的开始时间: \r\n- `HeaderExchangeChannel#request(Object, int, ExecutorService)` -> `DefaultFuture#newFuture(...)`\r\n\r\ntimeout 的结束时间:\r\n- `NettyClientHandler#write(...)` -> `HeaderExchangeHandler#sent(...)` -> `DefaultFuture.sent(...)`\r\n\r\n第1次调用 和 重试调用的时间差，主要是由 `NettyClientHandler#write(...)` 中的`super.write()`造成，即netty 的 `ChannelDuplexHandler#write()`造成。\r\n我通过简单的测试，第1次可能需要花费80ms，但第2+次只需要1ms左右。\r\n\r\n所以，重试时server多了80ms的交互时间来检测timeout。另外加上timeout检测机制的误差，可能多出100ms，所以重试（即第2+次）**可能成功！**\r\n\r\n(对netty也不了解，写了一个简单的demo测试netty write，同一个channel，第1次消耗20ms，之后用该channel重复write 都在 1ms内)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/618286870/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/618772241","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/pull/6049#issuecomment-618772241","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/6049","id":618772241,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxODc3MjI0MQ==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-24T02:49:29Z","updated_at":"2020-04-25T09:57:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#
