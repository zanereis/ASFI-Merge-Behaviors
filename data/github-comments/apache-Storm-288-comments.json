you can emulate pinning by setting the entry's weight to zero. Then the entry will not be evicted, but is eligible for expiration, etc. Of course zero weight entries means the cache allows more entries overall, whereas pinning might still restrict overall capacity. But its not clear how to a cache should handle evictions when not enough space can be freed from unpinned entries.\r\n\r\nThe other approach is less elegant. A `CacheWriter` can intercept an eviction and a `CacheLoader` intercepts gets to fetch a missing entry. Since recursive computations are disallowed, the writer could re-put the entry asynchronously. This races with a `get`, so the loader could fetch from the map prior to some other data store. In some ways not too dissimilar to your own pinned cache.\r\n\r\nIn general pinning breaks the caching model of recomputable transient state and the eviction policy will try to avoid pollution by removing low-value entries early. Generally it can lead to O(n) evictions unless maintained in a dedicated LRU queue so that potential victims are not evaluated. Since pinning vs capacity is confusing, right now Caffeine favors zero weights since the use-cases are unclear.\r\n\r\nHope that helps. I agree your own logic may be more straightforward and preferable.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/317538255/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/317543896","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2239#issuecomment-317543896","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2239","id":317543896,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNzU0Mzg5Ng==","user":{"login":"Ethanlm","id":14900612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTAwNjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14900612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethanlm","html_url":"https://github.com/Ethanlm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethanlm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethanlm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethanlm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethanlm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethanlm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethanlm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethanlm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethanlm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethanlm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-24T20:26:11Z","updated_at":"2017-07-24T20:27:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Tested

I only included them here because they have made much noise against Storm, otherwise not interesting in a perf shootout. \r\n- They are smart about not mentioning which version of Storm they are comparing with (how does a paper with such critical info missing get accepted ?). That creates an illusion in people that their perf claims apply to all versions of Storm in general... even if Storm [publishes new perf numbers](hortonworks.com/blog/microbenchmarking-storm-1-0-performance/) comparing itself to a prior version.\r\n- Heron's threading model (1 thread per process.. based on what i gather from their articles), is really primitive for this application domain.  I don't recommend it, but by setting 'topology.workers' equal to the number of spout& bolt instances, Storm can be run in Heron mode.\r\n-  I find it much easier to debug a process with multiple components using a debugger rather starting separate debuggers for every instance of spout/bolt. Also, I would imagine, having so many processes means you have an explosion of log files to deal with when triaging. \r\n- Unclear why the recovery model (when worker process crashes) is any better ... the same kind of replay from the spout would be required. The gains may be minor if any. Making minor optimizations to the failure path and penalizing the normal operation path... is backwards.\r\n- Cant get a stack from a Storm worker ? Thats clearly false. Try it yourself. I do it all the time. Heapdumps, on the other hand, can stall the worker and if the heap size is really large the supervisor might feel the worker is having a problem. There are timeouts that you can increase to for the supervisor to wait longer. I cant imagine that Heron doesn't monitor their workers and restart them if they are not responsive.\r\n-  Heron's Backpressure model is simply too overweight, but marketed as a novel idea.\r\n- A quick read of their latest perf blog, noted in the comparison, and it was evident that they missed recognizing their real perf problem.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/317879907/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/317886107","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2113#issuecomment-317886107","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2113","id":317886107,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNzg4NjEwNw==","user":{"login":"srdo","id":4324588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjQ1ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4324588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo","html_url":"https://github.com/srdo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-25T22:02:07Z","updated_at":"2017-07-25T22:02:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1, though I'll admit to just skimming it this time.

I thought I might have spent too much time providing measurements of various kinds, both in the design docs and here. :-) \r\n\r\nActually I have only presented a few pruned down numbers that I felt were interesting, in which case I was a bit meticulous to record the numbers. Given the scope of this patch, meticulously recording and cataloging all the perf tests that I have done (both high level profiler data & low level hardware perf counters) and performing the many more tests that I could have done, will take forever. I felt, ROI was -ve to rigorously pursue some of those measurements any further. \r\n\r\nIf you feel some other critical measurements are necessary, bring it up.\r\n\r\nBatching is a small aspect of this patch. I had done some quick tests to determine a default that appears to be a modest sweetspot for high throughput low latency topos, but not enough to provide a rigorous analysis. As batch size is very dependent on topology components, deployment size and ack-mode, IMO the search for a more generally optimal batch size is not important right now.\r\n\r\nI think we will have more publish worthy analysis once these changes stabilize and get more testing.\r\n\r\nOn a related note, about latency and ACK-mode, during my recent measurements, I noticed an issue in ACK mode, both in current master and optimized version, perf degrades with time (for certain batch sizes)...

Are all of the results from micro benchmarks?  Did anyone run a real topology with this patch before posting all of these wonderful results to twitter?  I am not one to swear but WTF?\r\n\r\nI built a stock 2.0.0-SNAPSHOT build (450ed637f92c3f387681a47b4b667f17eeecac1f) and compared it to the exact same release with this patch merged on top of it (which was a clean merge).  I am running\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ java -version\r\njava version \"1.8.0_121\"\r\nJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_121-b13)\r\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.121-b13, mixed mode)\r\n\r\nSierra 10.12.6\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015)\r\n2.8 GHz Intel Core i7\r\n16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3\r\n```\r\n\r\nI ran the ThroughputVsLatency topology with several different options and no changes at all to the default storm.yaml.\r\n\r\nWith this patch I found that.\r\n\r\n1. Running a topology with more than one worker appears to not be able to send any messages between workers (or it takes so long most of the messages time out). So I switched all of my tests to a single worker.\r\n2. When processing a nearly idle topology (500 sentences/second) the CPU utilization was everything that my box could give it.  (8 cores fully utilized) compared to about one half of one core used by stock storm.\r\n3. The latency is absolutely horrible.  The minimum latency for a somewhat idle topology was 1 to 4 seconds to do a word count.  For a topology processing 10,000 sentences per second it dropped to 800 ms.  The maximum latency was 15 seconds for all of these cases.  Compare that to stock storm which has a min latency of around 3 to 4 ms for the normal case.\r\n4. The system bolt metrics do not work, or at lest I was not able to get any of them back.  I tried to compare memory and CPU usage through top, which worked out OK.\r\n5. memory usage is insane.  The resident memory was 2 GB for almost all of the workers no matter the throughput.  That is 1 GB more than stock storm for the same 10,000 sentences per second.\r\n6. The maximum throughput is about 1/4th what it is on stock storm.  I was able to to 100,000 sentences per second on my laptop.  I could do it both with a single worker, and with 4 worker (although the CPU usage was higher in the latter case). With this patch I was able to do 30,000 sentences per second in the best case, but on average it could only do about 25,000.\r\n\r\nI am happy to make all of my numbers public.  I also plan to run them on a Linux box to see if it is any different.

Looking at ThroughputvsLatency I found some issues:\r\n - By default it adds 51 total threads , that IMO is incorrect when benchmarking in a 4-core machine. \r\n \r\n - Also it adds two bolts for logging/measurements which might be impacting the numbers\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/examples/storm-starter/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/starter/...\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/examples/storm-starter/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/starter/...\r\n \r\n - It also throttles the spout\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/examples/storm-starter/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/starter/...\r\n\r\nI did the following changes:\r\n- Disable the HTTP and Logging bolts\r\n- Disable throttling spout, we want spout to run as fast as it can\r\n- reduced the executor counts\r\n\r\nIf you see lines from 51 - 75 \r\n\r\nApache Master clearly couldn't handle the faster spout and starts timing out. Perf degrades considerably and very quickly. Where as STORM-2306 not only was able to handle the faster spout and delivered stable and processing at more start out being 10x faster then improves to 35x faster compared to master.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Also ran storm-perf topologies ConstSpoutIdNullBoltIdTopo and ConstSpoutNullBoltTopo. These topologies are trying to see whats the message throughput and latency when there are only 2 components involved without including any external dependencies. Essentially testing the messaging system.\r\n\r\nFrom line 3-45 you can see with this patch we are getting under 10ms (depends on the topology) compare to an avg of 250ms+.

We set desired throughput and see histogram of latency and other metrics. (CPU, GC, etc.) There're 3 components in topology which parallelism would be set to 4 * worker count so total 12 executor threads per worker. I think we can parameterize the magic number 4 and adjust it while testing too.\r\n\r\nI have also done with some performance tests, without modifying TVL topology. The reason is that we should also care about non-performance-maximized topology. For benchmarking performance maximized topology we also have ConstSpoutIdBoltNullBoltTopo, so let's not modify TVL and verify this patch works with all the cases.\r\n\r\nSince this patch doesn't seem to handle inter-worker communication properly, the test set what we can do for now is very limited.\r\n\r\nHere's my machine spec used for performance test:\r\n\r\n```\r\njava version \"1.8.0_131\"\r\nJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_131-b11)\r\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.131-b11, mixed mode)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nOS: Ubuntu 17.04\r\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 5 1600 3.2Ghz 6 core (with hyper-thread = 12 logical cores)\r\nRAM: Samsung DDR4 32G 19200\r\nSSD: Samsung 850 Evo\r\n```\r\n\r\nand here's my number (just pasted as raw number):\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1J3S4R68CsazlINF60rQn4XCy2Hx5QNzqVoWSO9qo2tc/edit?usp=sharing\r\n\r\nMy observation is that this patch looks impressive with performance maximized topology, but this also looks really bad (not acceptable) with relatively idle topology. \r\nI've observed all the things what @revans2 observed with TVL tests, one example is that with default parameter (or rate set to 10000, don't remember) of TVL, a worker for this patch showed over 300% (around 340%) of CPU usage whereas a worker for stock showed less than 70%. \r\nBut surprisingly this patch looks stable with ConstSpoutIdBoltNullBoltTopo and even CPU usage seems lower than stock in this test.\r\n\r\nWhile we often publicize micro-benchmark result, in practice users would run much idle topologies.\r\nI'm OK if things can be stabilized with adjusting parameters (if then I think default value should be set to support such case), but if not, it should be addressed before accepting the patch. I would be -1 until TVL results with various rate are not stable.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/318305990/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/318322416","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2241#issuecomment-318322416","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2241","id":318322416,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxODMyMjQxNg==","user":{"login":"harshach","id":38649,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NjQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38649?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach","html_url":"https://github.com/harshach","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-27T10:22:02Z","updated_at":"2017-07-27T10:34:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@HeartSaVioR Its not 12 executors per worker.

Most benchmarking is done where you push a system to its limits and see what maximum throughput it can do.  This is far from what a real user wants.  It looks good for a vendor to brag about I can do X but that other vendor over there can only do Y.  But it is close to worthless for what real users want to know.\r\n\r\nReal users are trying to balance the cost of the system in $ (CPU time + memory used become this, how many EC whatever instances do I need), the amount of data that they can push through the system and how quickly they can get results back.  Each of these variables are reflected by this test.  In most cases a user has a set load that they know they get typically, and a reasonable guess at a maximum load that they expect to see.  Also most users have a deadline by which the data is no good any more, if not they should be using batch.  And a budget that they have to spend on this project, if not call me I want to work for you and my salary requirements are very reasonable.\r\n\r\nYou need to give users tools to explore all three, and because the three are intertwined you want to be able to hold one or two of the variables constant while you measure the others.  Storm currently has no way to set a target SLA (I hope to add one eventually), but you can control the rate at which messages arrive and the parallelism of the topology, (which reflects the cost).  So the goal is to scan through various throughput values and various parallelisms to see what the latency is, and what resources are actually used.  In the read world we would adjust the heap size and parallelism accordingly.\r\n\r\nComplaining about a benchmark creating 51 threads relates to the parallelism that we want to explore.  If that is what I did wrong in the benchmark I am happy to adjust and reevaluate.  I want to understand how the parallelism impacts this code.  The thing that concerns me now is that it appears that scaling a topology is very different now, and I want to understand exactly how that works.\r\n\r\nI cannot easily roll out a change to my customers saying things might get a lot better or they might get a lot worse.

If you can do better then the stuff I did for disruptor by all means rip out my code and make things better.  The low throughput issue was one I had to fix with my initial patches to disruptor.  People do care about this.  I am not trying to be a jerk, I am just trying to keep my customers happy, share some of my experience doing something similar in the past, and also hopefully make storm much much better in the end.\r\n\r\nI apologize if  I offended anyone.  It was not my intention, but I really was shocked to see a patch everyone was touting as better than sliced bread decidedly worse in every way for a topology that worked really well before.  I was able to max out the default configuration of a parallelism of 4 at 100,000 sentences per second fully acked.  The new patch could only handle 1/3rd of that, and not when there is more then 1 worker.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/318379256/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/318439020","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2241#issuecomment-318439020","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2241","id":318439020,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxODQzOTAyMA==","user":{"login":"revans2","id":3441321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDEzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3441321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2","html_url":"https://github.com/revans2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-27T17:58:58Z","updated_at":"2017-07-27T17:58:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I have run some more tests looking at modifying the parallelism of different components.\r\n\r\nFirst I kept the parallelism of everything else at 4 and modified the acker count.\r\n![chart_ackers](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3441321/28684646-bc460734-72ca-11e7-9434-8bdf2c263cab.png)\r\n\r\nI also kept the ackers at 2 spout and count at 4 and modified the splitter count\r\n![chart_splitters](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3441321/28684647-bc462f5c-72ca-11e7-91f8-0a4e1c748682.png)\r\n\r\nThe acker drop off at 5 is really scary,  but adding too many splitters also shows a lot of problems.
