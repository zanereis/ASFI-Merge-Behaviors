Just seeing a couple minor things aside from the NPE I commented in the code.\r\n\r\nIt looks like the `operatePermissions` were added to the `ComponentEntity`. This is good since this applied to the majority of components. However, I noticed that the `operatePermissions` was also added to the each of the concrete implementations (`ProcessorEntity`, `PortEntity`, etc). I do not believe we need the field and getter/setter methods within each concrete implementation. Is there a reason they are there?\r\n\r\nAlso, I think we need to apply the new `Operation` policy checks in `FlowResource#activeControllerServices`. This is essentially like the corresponding `FlowResource#scheduleComponents` but for `ControllerServices`. This endpoint is not called directly by the NiFi UI but I think it should probably utilize the new policy.\r\n\r\nThanks again!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/422490094/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/422497709","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2988#issuecomment-422497709","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2988","id":422497709,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMjQ5NzcwOQ==","user":{"login":"nalewis","id":22083562,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDgzNTYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22083562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nalewis","html_url":"https://github.com/nalewis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nalewis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nalewis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nalewis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nalewis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nalewis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nalewis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nalewis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nalewis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nalewis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-18T18:24:10Z","updated_at":"2018-09-18T18:24:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jtstorck Got dragged away to other projects and wanted to get back to this.

If it's just another file in that same nar, it wouldn't be a lot of space.\r\n\r\nFor reference, I have the use-case where I have attributes on a FF and the content is a binary file. After putting the file to disk, I want to create a nested json object to continue processing. I essentially want to create a new record just from EL (same as UpdateRecord but with no reader).

I thought adding that to ComponentEntity is to vague as ComponentEntity is the super class of various entities, including those do not have running status such as `AccessPolicySummaryEntity`, `TemplateEntity` or `UserGroupEntity`.\r\n\r\nI wasn't consistent enough while I was refactoring the code at some point and added it to ComponentEntity. But I still think the operatePermissions should exist with only component those can be operated.

testing configuration enabled) and add the following (replacing `${nifi version}` with the current one) to the dependencies:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<dependency>\r\n\t<groupId>org.apache.nifi</groupId>\r\n\t<artifactId>nifi-testharness</artifactId>\r\n\t<version>${nifi version}</version>\r\n</dependency>\r\n```\r\nonce done, you can take the samples into your own project, where you can experiment with the test harness. \r\n\r\nI understand piggybacking on the tests directory is maybe not the perfect place to deliver samples, but given the circumstances I think it is acceptable and could maybe be improved in the future.
