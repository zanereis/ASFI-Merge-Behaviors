I could also, not get the debugger to attach to the \"spring-boot:run\" command, even though VS Code \"Notifications\" shows the \"Debug\", and waits for it to terminate. Either because I am passing the arguments wrong, or the below message actually does mean something:\r\n```\r\n--- spring-boot:3.1.4:run (default-cli) @ myapp ---\r\nAttaching agents: []\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, I am guessing, that there is already some basic integration with Spring.
