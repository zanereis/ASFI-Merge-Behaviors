That means we'll have to implement the RLS UI there prior to deprecation. That brings the question: \"where is the best place to manage RLS rules? should it be in the table editor? in the role editor? ...\".\r\n\r\nOne more comment about adding more semantics around clauses (the idea of the JSON blob there). To me it's not necessary for MVP, and I think the the forced logical `AND` is easy to express and reason about. I get how it'd be nice to have the logical OR on columns eventually, but asking for users to write JSON in a UI is not great, clearly a pattern we're moving away from. Maybe as we move to the new table editor we can design the UI that allows for that logical OR idea.\r\n\r\nFew more things, by default users shouldn't be able to modify RLS settings. For now the way to do that is to add the model view here: https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/master/superset/security.py#L100-L109 , I think that should do it.\r\n\r\nThe last thing is using the template processor. I think that's easy to do, just a matter of passing the template processor to `_get_row_level_filters`.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/562904039/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/562908992","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/8790#issuecomment-562908992","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/8790","id":562908992,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MjkwODk5Mg==","user":{"login":"issue-label-bot[bot]","id":48611044,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDg2MTEwNDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/27079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/issue-label-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-08T03:26:37Z","updated_at":"2019-12-08T03:26:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Issue-Label Bot is automatically applying the label `#bug` to this issue, with a confidence of 0.94.
