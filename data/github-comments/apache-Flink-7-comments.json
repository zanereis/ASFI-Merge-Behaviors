The sent data has to follow a very specific scheme defined within the class.\nLets say you have a plan with a single CSV source. In this case for the sources you would \n1. send 1 as an integer, representing the total number of sources\n2. send \"CSV\" denoting the type of source\n3. send a unique ID integer\n4. send a tuple containing (filePath,lineDelimiter,fieldDelimiter,type1,...,typeX)\n   the type arguments are exemplary objects, meaning that if you want to read Tuple2<Integer,Integer>, type1 and type2 would be integers\n\nThese behaviours are completely defined for \n    parameters (DOP, local execution)\n    data sources (CSV,TEXT,VALUE (fromElements())\n    data sinks (CSV,TEXT,PRINT)\n    broadcast variables\n\noperations are a bit different; but they follow the same pattern:\n1. send integer representing the total number of operations\n2. send operation identifier\n3. send all relevant arguments (this is partially implementee defined)\n\nbetween step 2(exclusive) and 3(inclusive) the following methods are called:\ncreateOperationInfo(identifier) (abstract)\ncreateXOperation(operationInfo)\napplyXOperation(parameter1,..., paremeterX, operationInfo) (abstract, only for UDF-operations)\n\ncreateOperationInfo is an abstract method with the purpose of creating an <? extends operationInfo> object\ncontaining all information necessary to apply an (UDF or non-UDF) operation.\nFor a python map for example, such an object would contain \n1. ID of set to apply map on\n2. serialized operator\n3. type argument\n4. some additional info :>\n\nThis object is passed to createXOperation. It extracts certain parameters from the object based on the identifier(these would be things that you usually would use for this operation, a join would extract grouping keys among others for example)\nand calls applyXOperation, which actually applies the operation. It was constructed this way so that the implementee has the freedom to implement operations however he wants, like a map as a map partition. I was wondering whether i should remove createXOperation.\n\nTo plug in python i had to very little on the java side:\n1. create functions (PythonMap, PythonCoGroup etc)\n2. extend Streamer and implement setupProcess (starting python process)\n3. extend OperationInfo (roughly 160 lines, given 16 operations thats about 10 each)\n4. extend PlanBinder (the abstract methods only took 100 lines)\n\nOn the external side you mostly need code to \n1. communicate with the stream (Connection.py)\n2. deserialize data following 1 protocol (Iterator.py)\n   1. `<type><record1><record2>...<recordX>` (Note: for join/cross the record is always a Tuple2)\n3. serialize data following 2 different protocols(Collector.py)\n   1. `<type1><record1><type2><record2>...<typeX><recordX>`\n   2. `<type><record1><record2>...<recordX>`\n4. PlanBinder counterpart, turn API calls into intermediate format and send it to java\n\nhmm...I'll leave it at that for now. If i keep writing too many in depth implementation details will slip in ^^\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/63110487/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/63122212","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/201#issuecomment-63122212","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/201","id":63122212,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzMTIyMjEy","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-14T20:11:11Z","updated_at":"2014-11-14T20:11:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for your PR!\n\nI think there are a few issues with your approach. For example, a CSV file that starts with a String field will not be skipped if it starts with a comment character such as '#' or '//'. Also, your changes on the DataSourceTask have implications for all InputFormats which is definitely not desired.\n\nIMO, it is necessary to explicitly specify a comment string and check for it at the beginning of each line.\n\nSkipping invalid lines is also a good feature in my opinion.

I think this is a great addition and we will improve on the performance soon :)\n\n@zentol, as @StephanEwen said it makes sense to execute right away. You can think of this as \"actions\" from Spark, which get results back to the user. He can't use a map function, because he doesn't emit any records, but just adds them to the accumulator.\n\nI've tried this out locally and it works, but you have to add the random IDs as you run into problem with multiple actions in the same program otherwise.\n\nWith this change, we also should allow to have prorams **without** sinks. Currently, you get a warning if you only have \"actions\" like collect/count without a sink.\n\nBefore we can merge this, you should also add test cases for both operators and make sure that it works with multiple actions per program.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/63456473/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/63456556","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/211#issuecomment-63456556","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/211","id":63456556,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzNDU2NTU2","user":{"login":"uce","id":1756620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTY2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1756620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce","html_url":"https://github.com/uce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-18T11:28:05Z","updated_at":"2014-11-18T11:28:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merging this.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/63456556/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/63457614","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/63#issuecomment-63457614","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/63","id":63457614,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzNDU3NjE0","user":{"login":"uce","id":1756620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTY2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1756620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce","html_url":"https://github.com/uce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-18T11:38:11Z","updated_at":"2014-11-18T11:38:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"See #210.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/63457614/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/63467505","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/210#issuecomment-63467505","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/210","id":63467505,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzNDY3NTA1","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-18T13:02:23Z","updated_at":"2014-11-18T13:02:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"hmm...alright, i can see the point. \n\nDoesn't executing right away carries the risk of it being inefficient when using them multiple times though?
