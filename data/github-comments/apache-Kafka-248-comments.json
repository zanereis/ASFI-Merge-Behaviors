The `TopicAdmin` internal utility class in Kafka Connect provides a slightly more usable layer on top of `AdminClient`, but its `createTopics` method is much simpler than before and attempts to create a set of topics and return the names of the topics that were in fact created; any topic name not included in the result implies an existing topic. (This same method in earlier commits attempted to list the topics and create only those topics that didn't yet exist, but doing this required extra requests to the brokers for little or no benefit.) \r\n\r\n@cmccabe and @ewencp: it would be possible to move that `TopicAdmin` logic into a new method on `CreateTopicResults` to be something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    /**\r\n     * Return a future that succeeds after all topic creation requests have been processed.\r\n     * @return a future that returns the names of all topics that were newly created by the request\r\n     */\r\n    public KafkaFuture<Set<String>> createdTopicNames() {\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo while I do think that this would be valuable, it doesn't seem to have the same API feel as the rest of the `AdminClient` API. And since Kafka Connect needs to perform this logic in multiple places, I've chosen to put that logic into the `TopicAdmin` internal utility class in Kafka Connect.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you think it would be better to have on the admin client's `CreateTopicResults`, or if there are any other suggestions/corrections.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/301917652/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/301919773","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/3028#issuecomment-301919773","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/3028","id":301919773,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMTkxOTc3Mw==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-16T21:22:54Z","updated_at":"2017-05-16T21:22:54Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer
