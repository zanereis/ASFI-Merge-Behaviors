However, I would fix the tests a bit differently.\r\nThe goal of the code that you removed was to validate that each partition is correctly sorted and that the partitions themselves are correctly sorted, i.e., for a descending sort, the highest values should be in partition 0 and the lowest in partition n.\r\n\r\nIn order to ensure parallel execution, we cannot execute the sort tests in a collection environment but need a cluster environment. Moreover, we should explicitly set a default parallelism on the ExecutionEnvironment to avoid that the program is executed with parallelism 1 (a parallelism of 3 should suffice). Once we do that we must ensure that the started minicluster offers enough slots to run the program.\r\n\r\nI'll add a few more inline comments to the tests.\r\n\r\nThanks, Fabian","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/272116784/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/272118573","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3095#issuecomment-272118573","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3095","id":272118573,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MjExODU3Mw==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-12T09:43:55Z","updated_at":"2017-01-12T09:43:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It might make sense to wait with this PR until #3099 is in","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/272118573/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/272121768","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3095#issuecomment-272121768","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3095","id":272121768,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MjEyMTc2OA==","user":{"login":"KurtYoung","id":955396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1NTM5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/955396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KurtYoung","html_url":"https://github.com/KurtYoung","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KurtYoung/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KurtYoung/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KurtYoung/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KurtYoung/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KurtYoung/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KurtYoung/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KurtYoung/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KurtYoung/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KurtYoung/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-12T09:58:20Z","updated_at":"2017-01-12T09:58:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@fhueske Ah i see, thanks for the explaining.
