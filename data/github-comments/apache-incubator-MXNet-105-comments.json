It accepts an argument `fn_array` which is a function to be called when both operands are of type `ndarray`. In current `mx.nd.add` implementation, it uses [`_internal._plus`](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/master/python/mxnet/ndarray.py#L625) for this argument. We could directly use `broadcast_plus` here for this function and remove the call to `broadcast_to`. This seems to be the minimal way of changing. What do you think @tqchen ?\n\nAnd another problem for the c++ version broadcasting. It does not support:\n\n```\na = mx.nd.ones((3,))\nb = mx.nd.ones((4, 3))\nc = a + b\n```\n\nThis is a valid broadcasting with left padding. It fails here: https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/master/src/operator/elementwise_binary_broadcast_op-inl.h#L57\n\nThe point is if we want the behavior to the same as `numpy`. We'd better allow this.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/241243845/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/241244047","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/3085#issuecomment-241244047","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/3085","id":241244047,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MTI0NDA0Nw==","user":{"login":"sxjscience","id":5178350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzgzNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5178350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience","html_url":"https://github.com/sxjscience","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-21T07:53:36Z","updated_at":"2016-08-21T07:53:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Changes
