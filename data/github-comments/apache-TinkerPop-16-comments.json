Thank you for doing this. Here are some notes.\n1. The term is \"namespace\" not \"domain.\" In case that terminology is used in the documentation and not just in the PR notes.\n2. Why do we have `@class` and `@type`. Seems we should just pick one. And if the answer is cause `@class` is for Java object mapping infrastructure, that isn't good and we will also use GraphSON to create `Vertex` objects in Python and it might use UUID for its ID as well. Thus, `@class=UUID` is perhaps `@type=UUID`. That is, if an object is \"typed\" its `@type` and the resolver (for that language) will have to map the correct class.\n3. I read your notes, but its still not clear to me. Why do we have `@value`? I think we only need `@type` (or `@class`) and then the rest of the JSON object data is up to the type serializer/deserializer. For instance, in `Bytecode` (TINKEROP-1278) we have `@type=Lambda` and then `value`, `language`, `arguments`. That is, there are 3 \"values\" we need to make the object and thus `@value` shouldn't be special with a `@`. Plus, we save a char.\n4. I think we can save some bytes and still be readable if we make our namespace `g` instead of `gremlin`. Moreover, we should be consistent in our naming convention and either use some standard JSON naming or default to Java naming -- e.g. `g:vertexProperty`. Or better yet, if its NOT namespaced, its assumed to be \"Gremlin\". That is, TinkerPop owns `vertex`, `vertexProperty`, `edge`. You want to do something else -- its `myapp:vertex`. This also means we own `uuid`, `int64`, etc. etc.\n\nThanks again for the extensive work.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/241105927/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/241106722","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/384#issuecomment-241106722","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/384","id":241106722,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MTEwNjcyMg==","user":{"login":"okram","id":148925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODkyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/148925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram","html_url":"https://github.com/okram","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-19T19:03:10Z","updated_at":"2016-08-19T19:03:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Great.

While writing that I realise I might have forgotten to update the \"the-graph.asciidoc\" doc... so I'll correct it. But in the actual code it shouldn't be there anymore.\n\n> `3.` I read your notes, but its still not clear to me. Why do we have `@value`? I think we [...]\n\nSo, taking a step back and I'm going to use the exampleof ByteCode. As you can see in the `GraphSONSerializersV2d0`, serializers don't have to care anymore about types, serializers are put into the context of \"You're in a place where you can write whatever you want, type is handled somewhere else for you\". \nFor the ByteCode serializer it means it would open a Map, put a field \"language\" and its value, put a field \"arguments\" and its value, put a field \"value\" (or maybe \"steps\" then?) and its value, close the map. When deserializing, read the map, get the fields values, create the ByteCode object. (you can see for example the [Path serializer](https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/386/files#diff-da3536d8d2e4a7f3798f4d707212a688R253) that would be a good comparison to the ByteCode serializer, and [its deserializer](https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/386/files#diff-da3536d8d2e4a7f3798f4d707212a688R485))\nThe complete payload for a typed ByteCode is then:\n\n```\n{\"@type\":\"gremlin:bytecode\", \"@value\":{\"arguments\": ..., \"language\": ....., \"steps\": ....}}\n```\n\nLet's admit for whatever reason the ByteCode serializer in the future needs to change and instead of writing a Map, it needs to start by an Array where the first element of the array is 'something', the rest is the Map described before, and close the array. Doing this is currently possible with the current format `{\"@type\":\"typename\", \"@value\":value}`, because the serializer is in a place where it can write whatever it wants to.\nNow let's consider another format: `{\"@type\":\"typename\", value}`. There, the serializer is put in the context \"You are currently in a **Map**, whatever you write, it must be in the form of a key/value pair\". The \"potential future\" evolution of the ByteCode serializer (writing an array) _wouldn't_ be possible. To handle that, we would have to change the type format for the ByteCode, and put it as for example `[\"typename\", value]` also we would update and tell the serializer \"Hey actually now, you're in the context of a List\". Then perfect, the serializer can write its List. But what we end up with, is an entity for which the type is `[\"typename\", value]` and other for which the type format is `{\"@type\":\"typename\", value}`. We could also let the serializers handle the type format and they decide how to put it, so that's fine, but the problem is deserialization. If there are multiple type formats it will be _very hard and in efficient_ for the type system (i'm talking about `GraphSONTypeDeserializer` for reference) to determine which type format is used at which moment, and the type system (`GraphSONTypeDeserializer`) **has** to find that type because it is the one that reads the types in order to call the deserializers. For the sake of consistency and the problems above I still think we'd better stick to the current format.\n\n> `4.` I think we can save some bytes and still be readable if we make our namespace g\n\nTotally fine with `g`, again for the sake of consistency, I think it'd be valuable to have a 'name space' all the time.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/241135508/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/241140701","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/386#issuecomment-241140701","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/386","id":241140701,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MTE0MDcwMQ==","user":{"login":"newkek","id":3471564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NzE1NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3471564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek","html_url":"https://github.com/newkek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-19T21:31:55Z","updated_at":"2016-08-19T21:31:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"_NB: the conflicts for merge are caused by the CHANGELOG_\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/241140701/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/241141740","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/384#issuecomment-241141740","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/384","id":241141740,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MTE0MTc0MA==","user":{"login":"pluradj","id":4974160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NzQxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4974160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj","html_url":"https://github.com/pluradj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-19T21:36:48Z","updated_at":"2016-08-19T21:36:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The colorization stuff looks good.\n\nOne small problem I've run into is that you can't set a prompt string that contains spaces.

Would be fine to handle this bug as a separate JIRA.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/241141740/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/241142514","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/384#issuecomment-241142514","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/384","id":241142514,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MTE0MjUxNA==","user":{"login":"pluradj","id":4974160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NzQxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4974160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj","html_url":"https://github.com/pluradj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-19T21:40:37Z","updated_at":"2016-08-19T21:40:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"VOTE: +1\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/241142514/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/241154329","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/386#issuecomment-241154329","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/386","id":241154329,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MTE1NDMyOQ==","user":{"login":"newkek","id":3471564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NzE1NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3471564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek","html_url":"https://github.com/newkek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-19T22:50:08Z","updated_at":"2016-08-19T22:50:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"A remark: @okram requested `TraversalExplanation` to be included in the list of Graph objects. I've noticed that the current `TraversalExplanation` Graphson serializer serializes a `Traversal`. In order to follow the requirement of this GraphSON2.0 type system, we would have to write a deserializer for the `TraversalExplanation` (there isn't currently). However, the current 1.0 serializer serializes the Traversal as the `toString()` of the Traversal's step list, which means that it is not possible to deserialize to a Traversal with only such info. So I believe it would be more appropriate to wait for TP1278 before implementing the `TraversalExplanation` ser/de and leave it out of the scope of this PR.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/241154329/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/241161008","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/386#issuecomment-241161008","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/386","id":241161008,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MTE2MTAwOA==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-19T23:40:45Z","updated_at":"2016-08-19T23:40:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think I agree with @newkek to push that off until we can get his massive PR reviewed/merged.

So if we do decide to use namespaces, then max-iteration should be deprecated but supported with and without namespace.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/241376894/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/241452987","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/386#issuecomment-241452987","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/386","id":241452987,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MTQ1Mjk4Nw==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-22T15:36:06Z","updated_at":"2016-08-22T15:36:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"VOTE +1\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/241452987/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/241453528","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/386#issuecomment-241453528","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/386","id":241453528,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MTQ1MzUyOA==","user":{"login":"dmill-bz","id":1415875,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTU4NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1415875?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmill-bz","html_url":"https://github.com/dmill-bz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmill-bz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmill-bz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmill-bz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmill-bz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmill-bz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmill-bz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmill-bz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmill-bz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmill-bz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-22T15:37:47Z","updated_at":"2016-08-22T15:37:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm waiting to hear back from marko on the points he brought up to cast my vote :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/241453528/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/241455858","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/386#issuecomment-241455858","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/386","id":241455858,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MTQ1NTg1OA==","user":{"login":"okram","id":148925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODkyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/148925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram","html_url":"https://github.com/okram","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-22T15:44:56Z","updated_at":"2016-08-22T15:44:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@newkek I understand.
