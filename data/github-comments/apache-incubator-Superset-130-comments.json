What I found is that Superset is using NVD3, which is a project that wraps and abstracts parts of D3. NVD3 is strongly tied to v3 of D3. See this issue discussion going back 2 years at the NVD3 project:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/novus/nvd3/issues/1681\r\n\r\nIf I were guessing, I would guess that NVD3 will never jump to D3 v4. So I guess before Superset decides whether or not to jump from v3 to v4 (or v5) of D3, they would first need to decide if they are going to continue to use NVD3 or go for a straight implementation of D3.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/378746562/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/378767310","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/4551#issuecomment-378767310","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/4551","id":378767310,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3ODc2NzMxMA==","user":{"login":"john-bodley","id":4567245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjcyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4567245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley","html_url":"https://github.com/john-bodley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-04T22:39:25Z","updated_at":"2018-04-04T22:39:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@mistercrunch this migration didn't cause a lock on our end.

I have found the similar issue yesterday on 0.24.0. And it is not a problem only in Time Series Line Chart, I was able to reproduce it with Pie Chart and Histogram as well, I didn't try more visualizations.\r\n\r\nIn my case, we use Snowflake database and I expected it is related to DB engine and I am still not sure what's exactly wrong, everything works fine with Superset examples and as well if I add the tables from Snowflake straight from dialog Sources/Tables/Add table (plus icon in right upper corner). But if I try to create datasource/table from query it didn't work. Then I realize there are quotes around column names in query (view query menu in graph view - upper right corner). \r\n\r\nSame as in @syzuhdi case\r\n\r\n> SELECT \"CITY\",\r\n> \"timestamp\",\r\n> \"count_QTY\"\r\n\r\nI tried to lowercase all column names and whoila, everything works. Lowercased name of columns are not in doublequotes and it is correctly interpreted.\r\n\r\nI made following steps:\r\n1. Run a query in SQL lab\r\n2. Visualize it - it will ask for datasource name\r\n3. Save the visualization\r\n4. Go to Sources/Tables and edit the table/datasource you created in step 2\r\n5. Rename all columns to lowercase \r\n6. Try to visualize graph\r\n\r\nIt's not nice, but it works for us as a temporary workaround.\r\nHTH.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/379154535/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
