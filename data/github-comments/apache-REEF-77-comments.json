There is no any change outside IMRU in this PR. Some classes are named as PipelinedBroadcastReduce, they were/are in IMRU namespace. \n2. IMRU.Example and IMRU are in separate dlls. UpdateResult was defined in IMRU and used in IMRU.Exmaple before the change. In the entire PR, I only enabled two properties in UpdateResult to be public. As UpdateResult has been exposed to public, and seems it was designed for the client to use it to hold update results in update function as a template. I don't see any potential issues for enabling its properties as public.  \n3. For IMRU example, if you concern is to make the basic task function simple, I can keep it and add another update function with state management in fault tolerant example. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/251236200/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/251256240","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/1134#issuecomment-251256240","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/1134","id":251256240,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MTI1NjI0MA==","user":{"login":"dougmsft","id":8461862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NjE4NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8461862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dougmsft","html_url":"https://github.com/dougmsft","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dougmsft/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dougmsft/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dougmsft/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dougmsft/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dougmsft/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dougmsft/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dougmsft/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dougmsft/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dougmsft/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-03T23:29:17Z","updated_at":"2016-10-03T23:29:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I have fixed everything you requested and then pushed the updated rebased branch from my dev machine to origin REEF-1554 and the changes do not show up here.
