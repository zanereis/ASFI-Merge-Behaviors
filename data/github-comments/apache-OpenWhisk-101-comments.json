Explicit `r` and `w` configurations are deprecated, instead couchdb will use half of the number of replicas for those two values.\r\n(These can also be specified via parameter in API) \r\n4. After setting up cluster, cluster configurations will be stored in `/opt/couchdb/etc/local.d`, so couchdb community highly recommend to use volume mapping of that directory.\r\n\r\nIn short, we don't need those configurations any more.\r\nInstead, we need to add `q` param when creating a database.\r\n\r\nI will update the code accordingly.\r\n\r\nOne question is, would it be required to add volume mapping for configuration directory as well?\r\nFor this, we need to keep configuration directory and files in OW repo such as `etc/default.ini` `etc/default.d/*.ini` `etc/local.d` because there will be no default configuration when volume is mapped.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/338092856/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/338098140","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/2076#issuecomment-338098140","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2076","id":338098140,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzODA5ODE0MA==","user":{"login":"csantanapr","id":1094878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTQ4Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1094878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr","html_url":"https://github.com/csantanapr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-20T03:42:50Z","updated_at":"2017-10-20T03:42:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Will go for 6.11.4 new runtime image being updated here https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-runtime-nodejs","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/338098140/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/338101376","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/2869#issuecomment-338101376","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2869","id":338101376,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzODEwMTM3Ng==","user":{"login":"dubee","id":11520887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIwODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11520887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee","html_url":"https://github.com/dubee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-20T04:12:46Z","updated_at":"2017-10-20T04:12:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Scenario two and three are just to keep in sync with the same type functionality that currently works with `--kind`.
