If you create three different pipelines (in a main method), then you will have three different contexts. It will be hard then to manage the contexts and pass from one execution to the other.\nThe runner is basically stateless.\nEven if it's \"weird\", the context inject is probably easier to implement. The \"context pooling\" is tricky to implement.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/222743802/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/222745534","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/401#issuecomment-222745534","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/401","id":222745534,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMjc0NTUzNA==","user":{"login":"amarouni","id":10761082,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzYxMDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10761082?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amarouni","html_url":"https://github.com/amarouni","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amarouni/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amarouni/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amarouni/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amarouni/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amarouni/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amarouni/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amarouni/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amarouni/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amarouni/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-31T16:35:31Z","updated_at":"2016-05-31T16:35:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@iemejia The spark context should be seen as an additional configuration element for the Spark runner.

I like that we're making the behavior explicit rather than trying to guess it.\n1. This may be too much configuration. There may be other/better ways of getting pane indices (eg., once we have a sink API or a state API). We should make sure we understand the use cases before exposing the knob. Especially since ReduceFnRunner is already complicated â€“ this is just adding more permutations of cases it needs to handle.\n2. I worry that the default, at least in the Pane Index case, is actually less performant than the ZERO case, which is likely what was desired 90% of the time. If we go this direction, I would propose we change the default.\n3. You should flesh this out to address error cases. When do we detect that the user is accessing the PaneIndex with the ZERO behavior specified. What kind of error message do they get?

Extra config. Yes, agree we already have a large config space hiding in WindowingStrategy and I'm not happy growing it. getOnTimeBehavior I've made peace with and we already had BEAM-32 asking for it. getPaneIndexBehavior is unfortunate. At this point I doubt any of this will be backported to DataflowJavaSDK so I think we can take the non-backwards compat path. In that case we could\n   a. Auto suppress indexed in the 'global like' window.\n   b. Give up on index entirely and supply a separate pane-counting combinator on top of StatefullDoFn\n   c. Keep the option.\n2. getPaneIndexBehavior default: I'd be happy to flip the default to ZERO, but better would be to not have it at all. \n3. PaneInfo.getIndex error checking: I sidestepped the error case by using PaneIndexBehavior.ZERO rather than UNDEFINED. We could switch to UNDEFINED and throw on PaneInfo.getIndex but that's at pipeline run time rather than verification time so it's gonna be annoying.

My preference would be to modify TestDoFn to be reusable, so long as the call sequence is correct (e.g. `startBundle` resets the state if state is `FINISHED`). The other is to use the ThreadLocal only when `startBundle` and `finishBundle` are the defaults (i.e. the declaring class is `org.apache.beam.sdk.transforms.DoFn`\n\nThis may be a discussion suitable for the mailing list.

You are right that most of BigData projects don't leverage groupId as they use an unique one. On the other hand, in projects like Camel, Karaf, ActiveMQ, etc we use different groupIds to group artifacts per function (core, component, etc). As said to Davor, either approach is fine for me, but we have to decide and we won't be able to change easily in the future.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/223894713/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/224006641","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/400#issuecomment-224006641","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/400","id":224006641,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNDAwNjY0MQ==","user":{"login":"jbonofre","id":158903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODkwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/158903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre","html_url":"https://github.com/jbonofre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-06T16:09:27Z","updated_at":"2016-06-06T16:09:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Rebased and updated.
