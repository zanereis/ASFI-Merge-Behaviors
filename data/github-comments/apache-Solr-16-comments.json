So the first version that @ackepenek had was basically the \"Add field type Template\".   You just put in the JSON, without the `add-field-template` command.   My gut feeling is that this is a tool that people coming from using Postman or other JSON syntax native tools, who don't want to figure out how to craft the perfect URL, would benefit from.   Those people would already have the command in it...\r\n\r\nThis does make me wonder, is the real utility of this screen that you can take your JSON commands and just paste them in and run them wihtout crafting the URL, or figuring out any security etc because you are in the admin tool?   \r\n\r\nMaybe what we really want is to support what https://solr.apache.org/guide/8_11/schema-api.html#multiple-commands-in-a-single-post suggests.   What if this was the \"Scripted Schema Modifications\"?   We reference the schema api docs, and you can mix up your various commands, `add-field-type`, `add-field`, `delete-field` etc?  They all go through the same `Schema.post` command anyway, right?  \r\n\r\nThis would let me take my `setup-experiment-schema.json` file that i already might have, and not have to worry about postman etc, just cut n paste right into solr.

So then if (and that remains an if) the Admin UI had the `hl.queryFieldPattern` option, should it only be showing it if `hl.requireFieldMatch` is unchecked?\r\n\r\nw.r.t. more obscure parameters not shown on the Admin UI, I wonder -- outside the scope of this pull request or SOLR-16111 -- if there might be an opportunity to (somehow) point into the reference guide more e.g.\r\n* `hl` to https://solr.apache.org/guide/8_11/highlighting.html\r\n* `facet` to https://solr.apache.org/guide/8_11/faceting.html\r\n*  `spatial` to https://solr.apache.org/guide/8_11/spatial-search.html\r\n* `spellcheck` to https://solr.apache.org/guide/8_11/spell-checking.html\r\n\r\nOr maybe that would add information overload too (and be relatively obvious)? And there's general `Documentation` and `Solr Query Syntax` links already.\r\n\r\nWould love to also hear @epugh's thoughts on this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1087776649/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1087848059","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/786#issuecomment-1087848059","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/786","id":1087848059,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5A1z57","user":{"login":"TomMD","id":137806,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzgwNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137806?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TomMD","html_url":"https://github.com/TomMD","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TomMD/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TomMD/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TomMD/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TomMD/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TomMD/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TomMD/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TomMD/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TomMD/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TomMD/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-04T17:56:16Z","updated_at":"2022-04-04T17:56:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@madrob One of those commits is no longer in the repo.
