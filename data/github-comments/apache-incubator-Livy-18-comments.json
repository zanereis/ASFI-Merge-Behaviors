For example, Hadoop 3.3.0 now includes `jsr311-api-1.1.1.jar`.  This is the jar that now contains the required class:\r\n```\r\njar tvf jsr311-api-1.1.1.jar | grep javax.ws.rs.ext.MessageBodyReader\r\n   950 Mon Nov 09 13:45:50 UTC 2009 javax/ws/rs/ext/MessageBodyReader.class\r\n```\r\nIf I manually add this jar to the class path of the Livy server, then it works as expected.\r\n\r\n@akitanaka, can you please add `jsr311-api-1.1.1.jar` and see if that works for you as well?  Shouldn't need to add `jersey-core-1.9.jar` if that's done as long as `jersey-core-1.19.jar` is on the

@JagadeeshNagella , unfortunately it is not possible with the setup you've described. The files should be available for Livy container and be `local` for its FS. So in your case I see several options:\r\n- Setup the process to copy .yaml file over to the Livy container and then refer it in the job request\r\n- Attach shared folder to Livy container and setup the process to copy files over to it for each user (I hope it is possible to configure ACLs for the share folder subdirectories)\r\n- Refer the file from the shared storage (eg.: hdfs or s3), though I'm not sure spark currently supports that\r\n\r\nThis is what I currently can come up with. I would also suggest reaching spark on Kubernetes community for the advice.\r\nBest.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/comments/768463208/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/comments/770018976","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-livy/pull/315#issuecomment-770018976","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/315","id":770018976,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MDAxODk3Ng==","user":{"login":"srinivasst","id":40173930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMTczOTMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40173930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srinivasst","html_url":"https://github.com/srinivasst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srinivasst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srinivasst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srinivasst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srinivasst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srinivasst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srinivasst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srinivasst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srinivasst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srinivasst/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-29T20:00:37Z","updated_at":"2021-01-29T20:00:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@jerryshao

Huge Thanks for your efforts on this. Saved us a few days. I could have saved some more had I found it sooner :-D\r\n\r\nAnyways, we're seeing some weird behaviour in which when spark-driver is connecting to Livy RPC. We see the following in the Livy logs:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/396205/124580884-31e82b80-de6e-11eb-804b-9502d62bc69e.png)\r\n\r\nThe Local (L) side is fine, as that's where livy's RPC server is running, but the Remote (R) side is incorrect. The remote should be coming as the driver pod and not `127.0.0.1`. Would you have any idea about this? \r\n\r\n\r\nTo get around this, I ended up making the following change.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/396205/124581087-6825ab00-de6e-11eb-92a3-98eb019f1ca8.png)\r\n\r\nAnd now, instead of connecting to the remote side of the channel, it tries to connect to the hostname communicated inside the RPC messages. \r\n\r\nNow I wonder \r\n* Why that's not already the case? Why are we not using the hostname communicated in the message. \r\n* How it works for you and others on this thread without this change? \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/comments/874627547/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/comments/874671228","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-livy/pull/167#issuecomment-874671228","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/167","id":874671228,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3NDY3MTIyOA==","user":{"login":"jahstreet","id":19328972,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzI4OTcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19328972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jahstreet","html_url":"https://github.com/jahstreet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jahstreet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jahstreet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jahstreet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jahstreet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jahstreet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jahstreet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jahstreet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jahstreet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jahstreet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-06T11:11:12Z","updated_at":"2021-07-06T11:11:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @prongs , thank you for joining the party 🎉 .\r\nThis PR is outdated and kept just for the discussions (probably I should reflect that in the description).\r\nThe work done here were split into smaller pieces and the first one lives now in #249 .
