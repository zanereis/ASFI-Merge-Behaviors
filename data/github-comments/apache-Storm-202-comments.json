Currently, basic implementation <br/>\n    +for HBase is given with `HBaseWindowsStoreFactory`.

I don't understand why copying the Objenesis code into Storm would improve things. If we put it in the original package it's equivalent to just depending on the Objenesis jar. If we move it, Kryo can't find it unless we use shading. If we shade it we also need to shade Kryo in order for storm-core to work as a dependency during tests (otherwise we declare a dependency on Kryo which depends on an unshaded Objenesis).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/202955987/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/202977673","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1224#issuecomment-202977673","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1224","id":202977673,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwMjk3NzY3Mw==","user":{"login":"revans2","id":3441321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDEzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3441321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2","html_url":"https://github.com/revans2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-29T16:09:16Z","updated_at":"2016-03-29T16:09:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 looks good to me.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/202977673/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612886113","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/5469#issuecomment-2612886113","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/5469","id":2612886113,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI4ODYxMTM=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-29T16:09:17Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T16:08:23Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=githubbot\">githubbot</a>:</i>\n<p>Github user revans2 commented on the pull request:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1224#issuecomment-202977673\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1224#issuecomment-202977673</a></p>\n\n<p>    +1 looks good to me.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612886113/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
