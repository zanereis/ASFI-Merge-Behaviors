I know quite well how SDF IOs are supposed to work. 😃 \r\n\r\nHowever, I think that in properly unbounded pipelines the \"discovery source\" will also stay online forever. (I think of SDF IOs like this: \"Discovery Source/DoFn\" -> \"Reader SDF\", where for Kafka the discovery source would listen for new partitions on the topics and forward them as they come online, for Kinesis it would listen for new shards and for files it would listen for files)\r\n\r\nSide note: I think the Beam Kafka IO does currently not discover new partitions when a pipeline is already running, which is a bit of a problem. Having the discovery source stay always online would solve this. Not sure about the Kinesis IO. Flink has a different problem: all parallel instances of a source query for new Kafka partitions/Kinesis Shards and they have a deterministic way of assigning them to the instances (basically modulo). This, however, will DDoS Kafka/Kinesis which also can lead to problems. SDF IOs would solve this problem because there is only one part that does the periodic querying for new shards/partitions. Also, the Flink File source has worked like a SDF IO for quite a while now but we have never generalised the pattern as in what we want to do with SDF IOs in Beam.\r\n\r\nOn your last point: we currently can't do this because then our tests would not terminate and also because \"bounded streaming pipelines\" (which sounds very strange) would not terminate.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/364872615/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/364921393","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/4661#issuecomment-364921393","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4661","id":364921393,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDkyMTM5Mw==","user":{"login":"aromanenko-dev","id":33895511,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzODk1NTEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33895511?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aromanenko-dev","html_url":"https://github.com/aromanenko-dev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aromanenko-dev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aromanenko-dev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aromanenko-dev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aromanenko-dev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aromanenko-dev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aromanenko-dev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aromanenko-dev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aromanenko-dev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aromanenko-dev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-12T13:25:07Z","updated_at":"2018-02-12T13:25:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @kennknowles @pawel-kaczmarczyk, can you please take a look?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/364921393/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/364937095","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/4662#issuecomment-364937095","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4662","id":364937095,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDkzNzA5NQ==","user":{"login":"iemejia","id":79476,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79476?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia","html_url":"https://github.com/iemejia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-12T14:25:06Z","updated_at":"2018-02-12T14:25:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I will take a look at this on gradle once the support is finished.

would like to abolish the ill-defined concepts of sources and sinks, instead having everything be just transforms (and IOs be simply an informal name for transforms used for a particular purpose) - and SDF is part of that vision :) If we need to watch for new Kafka partitions - there needs to be a splittable or stateful DoFn to do that (applied to a PCollection of topics), before the partition-reading SDF. If anything is designated as a \"source\", it can no longer be placed anywhere except at the very root of the pipeline, and can no longer be data-dependent.\r\n\r\nThis is also in line with the Fn API where the concept of sources doesn't exist either (or, currently exists on life support but is destined to be deleted) - instead it only has a primitive \"impulse\" that generates a single empty value to kick off everything else.\r\n\r\nDo we have any other options?
