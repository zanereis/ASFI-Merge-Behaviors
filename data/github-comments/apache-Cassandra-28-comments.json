If you recall I submitted a pull request for Cassandra-12937 that included a change to the `topology.properties` file.  You asked why that change was made and I could not answer as I received it from a development branch that I did not work on.  However, I discovered that if you run `ant test` that file would be overwritten.  While this is not a problem on the CI system it does cause a problem on development systems where the modified file can be accidentally checked in :raised_hand_with_fingers_splayed:.  This change to one file solves the problem.  Please review and let's see if we can get this in.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/comments/2031281418/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/comments/2034310815","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/3212#issuecomment-2034310815","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/3212","id":2034310815,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmWM55QR6f","user":{"login":"Mmuzaf","id":3415046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUwNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3415046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mmuzaf","html_url":"https://github.com/Mmuzaf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mmuzaf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mmuzaf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mmuzaf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mmuzaf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mmuzaf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mmuzaf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mmuzaf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mmuzaf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mmuzaf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-03T11:23:37Z","updated_at":"2024-04-03T11:23:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I

In order to support this the TableParams.builder needs to know the keyspace name when building so that it can be passed to the CompressonParams.builder where the filter for determining which tables get the old DEFAULT and which get the new calculated default Compression params is handled by the CompressionParams.defaultParams(keyspace) method.\r\n\r\n> This change in turn led to changes to several files where the keyspace name needed to be provided for the TableParams.builder().build() function call.\r\n\r\nActually why do we need all of those changes? System tables are not something which magically appear in the system - they are created explicitly and we can explicitly set compression to none when creating them?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/comments/2039468284/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/comments/2042135825","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/3203#issuecomment-2042135825","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/3203","id":2042135825,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmWM55uIUR","user":{"login":"bereng","id":6973517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NzM1MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6973517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bereng","html_url":"https://github.com/bereng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bereng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bereng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bereng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bereng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bereng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bereng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bereng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bereng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bereng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-08T08:16:42Z","updated_at":"2024-04-08T08:16:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"In HintsReaderTest and HintsDescriptorTest there is code to generate corrupt hints files and then you could test that.

@bschoening,\r\n\r\nHere are some of the observations:\r\nInitially when there is no Capture.\r\nshunted_query_out is `None`\r\nquery_out is `<_io.TextIOWrapper name='<stdout>' mode='w' encoding='utf-8'>` which is stdout.\r\n\r\nWhen we start Capturing (example `Capture 'demo_capture.txt'`):\r\nshunted_query_out is `<_io.TextIOWrapper name='<stdout>' mode='w' encoding='utf-8'>` which is stdout\r\nquery_out is `<_io.TextIOWrapper name='demo_capture.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>` which is the file demo_capture.txt.\r\n\r\nAccording to the observations \r\nWe are not able to get the file information from shunted_query_out. I feel we need to send query_out to shell.writeresults() .\r\nIn Tracing.py the  shell.print_formatted_result should be`shell.print_formatted_result(formatted_names, formatted_values, with_header=True, tty=shell.tty, out=shell.shunted_query_out)` in case `out` is None then output should be `query_out`.\r\n\r\nStill figuring it out.

The only question is whether or not it is worth to check other spots where we are waiting uninterruptibly, in places such as `PaxosBackedProcessor` and `PeerLogFetcher`, etc?\r\n\r\nI think the instances in `PaxosBackedProcessor` are ok as they already specify timeouts. I don't think there are any uninterruptible waits in `PeerLogFetcher`, but there were a couple in `RemoteProcessor` which I've made interruptible. These were already wrapped by catches for `InterruptedException` so that seems reasonable to me. I've attached a new CI summary to the jira, which again shows no new failures.
