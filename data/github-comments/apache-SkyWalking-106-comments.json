But actually, we don't need that much, in 6.1.0 -> 6.3.0(release soon), we have optimized the thread model very much, we have a new shared consumer thread pool to avoid the root cause, which is also the root cause of your scenario, that is too many unnecessary threads, triggering high CPU load.\r\n\r\nYou could dig a little more about the master branch, to see what we are doing today.
