Given the to/from methods `@JsonCreator` and `asCloudObject`, it should be Jackson-JSON-serialized like all other non-`CustomCoder`s.\n\nFWIW serialization proxies like the one in `AvroCoder` are a standard way to correctly use Java's serialization APIs when you actually design your serialization somewhat. It is pretty surprising that the Kryo/Spark community hasn't been bitten repeatedly, if it is just ignored.\n\nPerhaps everyone just choose between (1) use Java serialization if you don't want to design your serialization (lots of pitfalls, but OK for transmission-only uses) or when you outgrow that (2) use something else entirely. Certainly that's been my trajectory in the past...\n\nWe need to take path (2) for Beam coders. We may support language-specific coders in some ways, but they will be by far more costly and non-portable. `AvroCoder` must not be one of them, so it needs to just have a JSON format.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/257384352/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/257387799","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/1220#issuecomment-257387799","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/1220","id":257387799,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NzM4Nzc5OQ==","user":{"login":"sb2nov","id":1517779,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTc3Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1517779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sb2nov","html_url":"https://github.com/sb2nov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sb2nov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sb2nov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sb2nov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sb2nov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sb2nov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sb2nov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sb2nov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sb2nov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sb2nov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-31T19:00:19Z","updated_at":"2016-10-31T19:00:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"R: @robertwb \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/257387799/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/257414930","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/941#issuecomment-257414930","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/941","id":257414930,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NzQxNDkzMA==","user":{"login":"lukecwik","id":10078956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc4OTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10078956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik","html_url":"https://github.com/lukecwik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-31T20:43:24Z","updated_at":"2016-10-31T20:43:24Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Ok, I took a stab at this and was able to maintain the existing performance and thread safe like we had before and make the serialization cross compatible with Kryo and Java.
