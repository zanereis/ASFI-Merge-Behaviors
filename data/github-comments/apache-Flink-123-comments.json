I'm actually not so sure whether `RpcGateway.getAddress` method is something framework specific. For any `RpcService` implementation you need some kind of address to connect to a `RpcEndpoint`. The `RpcService` has the method `connect` which requires exactly this information to open a connection. Thus, I think that every `RpcGateway` should be able to tell to which `RpcEndpoint` it is currently connected. So for example, there is currently also no way to open another `RpcGateway` to the same `RpcEndpoint` given a `RpcGateway`. What do you think?\n2. You're right, the current implementation has the same problem and should be fixed either way.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/240974024/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/240974738","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2385#issuecomment-240974738","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2385","id":240974738,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MDk3NDczOA==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-19T09:41:45Z","updated_at":"2016-08-19T09:41:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks good to me.\n+1\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/240974738/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/240977408","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2385#issuecomment-240977408","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2385","id":240977408,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MDk3NzQwOA==","user":{"login":"uce","id":1756620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTY2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1756620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce","html_url":"https://github.com/uce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-19T09:54:31Z","updated_at":"2016-08-19T09:54:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I will merge this and add the following test for min pause.

Very useful one. Also I saw some of the interfaces though they are supposed to be Public it is not marked with those types. Is it better to fix all of them ? Or add a test case that ensures that any new class/existing class if it misses annotation either Public or Private or what ever could be a new type, then we should fail the build. We have such a procedure in our project. Sorry if this is offtopic.

I think your implementation goes into the right direction and I really like the testing.\n\nI think what we still can and should improve is to pull out the `MatchingBehaviour` out of the `SharedBuffer` and the `State`. The `NFA` should be the only component which is responsible for the matching behaviour. I think we can achieve this if we pimp the `SharedBuffer` a little bit.\n\nSo what should roughly happen is that the `NFA` removes computation states which are not longer valid. Furthermore, we have to clean up the `SharedBuffer` and remove `SharedBufferEntries` which depend on other `SharedBufferEntries` which are no longer valid (e.g. due to `MatchingBehaviour.afterLast`). \n\nSo when you have a `SharedBufferEntry` representing a certain state which is part of the currently matched sequence and `MatchingBehaviour.afterLast`, then you have to find out all `SharedBufferEntries` which depend on this state (children) and remove them. That you have to do until you reach the youngest descendant. Currently we can only find the predecessors for a given `SharedBufferEntry` but not the children. I think that would have to be added in order to implement the different `MatchingBehaviours`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/241073393/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/241074865","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2342#issuecomment-241074865","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2342","id":241074865,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MTA3NDg2NQ==","user":{"login":"ramkrish86","id":3690658,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2OTA2NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3690658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86","html_url":"https://github.com/ramkrish86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-19T17:03:25Z","updated_at":"2016-08-19T17:03:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@uce \nThanks.

The first part could be the heartbeat logic a.k.a. `HeartbeatManager`.   Here we could try to implement a generic sending and receiving end. I think the implementation can almost be independent of the JM, RM and TE implementation (similar to `RetryingRegistration`). This will allow us to easily test this component.\n\nThe next step would be the integration of this component into the RM, JM and TE.\n\nConcerning the slot request logic I think we should wait a little bit for the `SlotManager` implementation. It could be the case that the `SlotManager` will make the rpcs to the `TaskExecutor` and not the RM. But for the moment the interface is, afaik, not well enough specified to program against it.\n\nThe failure notification should also be treated in a separate PR imo. The notification can have multiple origins (e.g. `HeartbeatManager` or the resource management framework) and should be designed in such a way.\n\nIn general, I think the components should be more thoroughly tested with more fine-grained unit tests. Furthermore, I think it would be good if we could revise the code documentation a little bit.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/241432182/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/241433252","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2332#issuecomment-241433252","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2332","id":241433252,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MTQzMzI1Mg==","user":{"login":"rmetzger","id":89049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger","html_url":"https://github.com/rmetzger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-22T14:37:04Z","updated_at":"2016-08-22T14:37:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@delding: Thanks a lot for opening a pull request for a streaming hbase connector to Flink.\nWould you be okay with contributing the connector to Apache Bahir, instead of Apache Flink?\nThe repository is located here: https://github.com/apache/bahir-flink\n\nThe Flink community recently decided to move some of our connectors to Apache Bahir [1][2].\nIf you want, I can also help migrating the pull request over to Bahir.\nAt Bahir, I'll help with the review and make sure it gets merged.\nAlso, once the first Flink connectors are in Bahir, I'm proposing (to the Bahir community) to create a first Bahir-flink release to get the code out.
