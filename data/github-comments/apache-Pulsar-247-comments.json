PR #7141 is merged. You can try out on the master branch. I will move this PR to 2.7.0 first since we need to prepare the 2.6.0 release.\r\n\r\n@codelipenghui  PR #7141 doesn't seem to help with Pulsar Readers since Readers are always using exclusive subscriptions under the covers (https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/208af7cd7e718d378707df4aba600be3202e23df/pulsar-client/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/client/impl/ReaderImpl.java#L48). Since a Pulsar Reader wraps a Consumer internally, I was thinking of the possibility of using a NonDurable Consumer directly without the Reader \"wrapper\". However this approach fails because creating NonDurable Consumers remains broken, that I have reported as #7436.\r\n\r\n@codelipenghui would it be possible to extend the solution that was made in #7141 to also cover Readers?\r\nI'm having issues with using seekAsync + hasMessageAvailableAsync on Readers. It seems that there are race conditions because of the current solution that  disconnects from the broker side after the seek. The usage of seek + hasMessageAvailableAsync in Readers isn't deterministic at all. There's a separate issue about the issues with hasMessageAvailabe after seek, that's #7796 . \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/691994440/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/691995902","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/7796#issuecomment-691995902","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/7796","id":691995902,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5MTk5NTkwMg==","user":{"login":"lhotari","id":66864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari","html_url":"https://github.com/lhotari","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-14T11:35:38Z","updated_at":"2020-09-14T11:35:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@aloyszhang  I checked the PR #7848 .

Good work. \r\n\r\nWould it be possible to add test cases with ordinary message id seeks? For example a test case where there would be a fixed number of messages in a topic (for example just 3 message). When publishing the messages to the topic, their respective MessageIds could be stored. The test would then do a given number of reads (for example 100 times) where it first uses seek to go to one of the randomly picked message ids, checks with hasMessageAvailable that there's a message available and then reads the message and verifies that it's the correct message. This should be enough to show that the problem with seek + hasMessageAvailable has been resolved and doesn't run into some race conditions caused by the broker code that \"disconnects all the connected consumers and then resets the cursor\" (as described in #5278).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/692014328/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/692030943","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/8054#issuecomment-692030943","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/8054","id":692030943,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5MjAzMDk0Mw==","user":{"login":"zymap","id":24502569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTAyNTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24502569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap","html_url":"https://github.com/zymap","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-14T12:51:13Z","updated_at":"2020-09-14T12:51:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"/pulsarbot

pulsar-url as part of SNI header without trying to resolve pulsar broker hosts. Proxy-host which supports SNI-routing , gets the target broker-service-url from SNI and creates proxy between pulsar-client and pulsar-server. Therefore, Pulsar client can only resolve proxy host and client can't resolve any broker hosts. so, pulsar-client does not try to resolve broker-host and passes it to proxy in SNI header without resolving the address.\r\nCan you share the stacktrace for your issue? Pulsar client only tries to resolve proxy host so, can you check if you can resolve porxy-host from the client?\r\n\r\n—You are receiving this because you were mentioned.Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or unsubscribe.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/692306010/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/692318580","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/8056#issuecomment-692318580","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/8056","id":692318580,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5MjMxODU4MA==","user":{"login":"rdhabalia","id":2898254,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTgyNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2898254?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia","html_url":"https://github.com/rdhabalia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-14T21:15:17Z","updated_at":"2020-09-14T21:15:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> But, the method createConnection is invoked with the broker host, then invokes connectToResolvedAddresses which in turn invokes connectToAddress where the broker address is set as the SNI host and the proxy URL host is connected to instead.I suggest that in createConnection InetAddress.getByName is replaced with the parameter 'unresolvedAddress\r\n\r\nyes, client should avoid resolving the broker address and pass it in SNI header.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/692318580/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/692344168","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/8056#issuecomment-692344168","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/8056","id":692344168,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5MjM0NDE2OA==","user":{"login":"racorn","id":6697938,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTc5Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6697938?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/racorn","html_url":"https://github.com/racorn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/racorn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/racorn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/racorn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/racorn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/racorn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/racorn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/racorn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/racorn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/racorn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-14T22:20:29Z","updated_at":"2020-09-14T22:20:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rdhabalia \r\nSorry for the confusion, I will try to clear things up.\r\n\r\nThe code below is `ConnectionPool.createConnection`:\r\n```\r\n     /**\r\n     * Resolve DNS asynchronously and attempt to connect to any IP address returned by DNS server\r\n     */\r\n    private CompletableFuture<Channel> createConnection(InetSocketAddress unresolvedAddress) {\r\n        String hostname = unresolvedAddress.getHostString();\r\n        int port = unresolvedAddress.getPort();\r\n        try {\r\n            // For non-sni-proxy: Resolve DNS --> Attempt to connect to all IP addresses until once succeeds\r\n            CompletableFuture<List<InetAddress>> resolvedAddress = isSniProxy()\r\n                    ?

Thanks for adding thread safety.\r\n\r\nI notice the use of a mutex. A lock-free alternative would be more involved, not sure if would be worth the effort. Anyway, a possible solution could be to have the `ConnectionPool` take more responsibility of bootstrapping TLS connections. For example invoking `Bootstrap.register` instead of `Bootstrap.connect`, and adding the `SSLHandler` to the channel pipeline outside of `PulsarChannelInitializer.initChannel()` before connecting the channel to the remote host. The `SSLHandler` could be added in a new method in `PulsarChannelInitializer`, for example `CompletableFuture<Channel> initSSL(Channel channel, String sniHostName, int sniHostPort)`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/692653350/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/692663048","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/8066#issuecomment-692663048","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/8066","id":692663048,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5MjY2MzA0OA==","user":{"login":"shustsud","id":51769018,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzY5MDE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51769018?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shustsud","html_url":"https://github.com/shustsud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shustsud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shustsud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shustsud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shustsud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shustsud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shustsud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shustsud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shustsud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shustsud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-15T11:47:37Z","updated_at":"2020-09-15T11:47:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"/pulsarbot

It looks good, my only concern is that now `private CompletableFuture<Channel> connectToAddress(InetAddress ipAddress, int port, InetSocketAddress sniHost)` does synchronous channel initialization.\r\n\r\nTo do asynchronous channel initialization, this is a possible attempt:\r\n ```\r\nprivate CompletableFuture<Channel> connectToAddress(final InetAddress ipAddress, final int port,\r\n            final InetSocketAddress sniHost) {\r\n        CompletableFuture<Channel> future = new CompletableFuture<>();\r\n        // if proxy is configured in pulsar-client then make it thread-safe while updating\r\n        // channelInitializerHandler\r\n        if (isSniProxy) {\r\n            bootstrap.register().addListener((ChannelFutureListener) cf -> {\r\n                if (cf.isSuccess()) {\r\n                    try {\r\n                        channelInitializerHandler.initChannel(cf.channel(), sniHost);\r\n                        cf.channel().connect(new InetSocketAddress(ipAddress, port))\r\n                                .addListener((ChannelFutureListener) channelFuture -> {\r\n                                    if (channelFuture.isSuccess()) {\r\n                                        future.complete(channelFuture.channel());\r\n                                    } else {\r\n                                        future.completeExceptionally(channelFuture.cause());\r\n                                    }\r\n                                });\r\n                    } catch (Exception e) {\r\n                        log.warn(\"Failed to initialize channel with {}, {}\", ipAddress, sniHost, e);\r\n                        future.completeExceptionally(e);\r\n                    }\r\n                } else {\r\n                    future.completeExceptionally(cf.cause());\r\n                }\r\n            });\r\n        } else {\r\n            bootstrap.connect(ipAddress, port).addListener((ChannelFutureListener) cf -> {\r\n                if (cf.isSuccess()) {\r\n                    future.complete(cf.channel());\r\n                } else {\r\n                    future.completeExceptionally(cf.cause());\r\n                }\r\n            });\r\n        }\r\n        return future;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n```\r\nHere, the `PulsarChannelInitializer.initChannel(cf.channel(), sniHost)` is run in the callback thread, I assume it will be the Channel event loop thread. If that is not good enough, one could take it a step further and make `PulsarChannelInitializer.initChannel(cf.channel(), sniHost)` private, then add a new method to `PulsarChannelInitializer`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    public CompletableFuture<Channel> initSniSsl(final Channel ch, final InetSocketAddress sniHost) {\r\n        if (!isSniProxyEnabled) {\r\n            throw new IllegalStateException(\"This method can only be invoked when SniProxy is enabled\");\r\n        }\r\n        CompletableFuture<Channel> initFuture = new CompletableFuture<>();\r\n        ch.eventLoop().execute(() -> {\r\n            try {\r\n                initChannel(ch, sniHost);\r\n                initFuture.complete(ch);\r\n            } catch (Throwable t) {\r\n                initFuture.completeExceptionally(t);\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n        return initFuture;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen update ConnectionPool:\r\n```\r\n    private CompletableFuture<Channel> connectToAddress(final InetAddress ipAddress, final int port,\r\n            final InetSocketAddress sniHost) {\r\n        CompletableFuture<Channel> future = new CompletableFuture<>();\r\n        // if proxy is configured in pulsar-client then make it thread-safe while updating\r\n        // channelInitializerHandler\r\n        if (isSniProxy) {\r\n            bootstrap.register().addListener((ChannelFutureListener) cf -> {\r\n                if (cf.isSuccess()) {\r\n                    try {\r\n                        initSniSsl(cf.channel(), sniHost)\r\n                                .whenComplete((channel, error) -> {\r\n                                    if (error != null) {\r\n                                        future.completeExceptionally(error);\r\n                                    } else {\r\n                                        channel.connect(new InetSocketAddress(ipAddress, port))\r\n                                                .addListener((ChannelFutureListener) channelFuture -> {\r\n                                                    if (channelFuture.isSuccess()) {\r\n                                                        future.complete(channelFuture.channel());\r\n                                                    } else {\r\n                                                        future.completeExceptionally(cf.cause());\r\n                                                    }\r\n                                                });\r\n                                    }\r\n                                });\r\n                    } catch (Throwable t) {\r\n                        future.completeExceptionally(t);\r\n                    }\r\n                } else {\r\n                    future.completeExceptionally(cf.cause());\r\n                }\r\n            });\r\n        } else {\r\n            bootstrap.connect(ipAddress, port).addListener((ChannelFutureListener) cf -> {\r\n                if (cf.isSuccess()) {\r\n                    future.complete(cf.channel());\r\n                } else {\r\n                    future.completeExceptionally(cf.cause());\r\n                }\r\n            });\r\n        }\r\n        return future;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nA bit complicated when having to deal with both ChannelFutures and CompletableFutures :-)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/693001175/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/693013937","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/6484#issuecomment-693013937","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/6484","id":693013937,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5MzAxMzkzNw==","user":{"login":"mwmitchell","id":11620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwmitchell","html_url":"https://github.com/mwmitchell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwmitchell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwmitchell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwmitchell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwmitchell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwmitchell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwmitchell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwmitchell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwmitchell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwmitchell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-15T22:31:19Z","updated_at":"2020-09-15T22:31:19Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Just ran into this issue too.
