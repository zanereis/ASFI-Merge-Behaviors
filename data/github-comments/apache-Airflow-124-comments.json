Here is a super high-level sketch of how dag-level access control could be implemented (not final or only way):\r\n\r\n(1) Currently each endpoints is annotated with the @has_access decorator, which essentially tells FAB to create a single permission-view mapping for that endpoint in the db. To make this DAG-level, we'd have to re-implement the decorator so it has more granularity: instead of creating one perm-view mapping per endpoint, we'd need one per endpoint _per DAG_. \r\n\r\n(2) Modify the dag file parser so that it can parse a new 'access_control' config in the dag file. It would then add/delete restricted permission-view-mapping to the db (depending on if the starting point is no access or all access)\r\n\r\n(3) For any high-level pages (i.e the homepage, /list/taskinstance, /list/dagrun, etc.), they need to be be filtered.\r\n\r\nThe implementation won't be trivial, but I do see a path for it as described above. Let me know if you have more questions/concerns.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/367174155/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/367178597","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2472#issuecomment-367178597","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2472","id":367178597,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NzE3ODU5Nw==","user":{"login":"jgao54","id":17896160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODk2MTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17896160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54","html_url":"https://github.com/jgao54","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-21T01:08:44Z","updated_at":"2018-02-21T01:08:44Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Resolved

a generic operator which executes querys depending on connection type, if anyone is using this like me, it will break.\r\n\r\nYou can test using like this:\r\n\r\nDag:\r\n```python\r\nfrom datetime import datetime\r\n\r\nfrom airflow import DAG\r\nfrom lib.operators.test_operator import TestOperator\r\n\r\ndefault_args = {\r\n    'depends_on_past': False,\r\n    'start_date': datetime(2018, 2, 21),\r\n}\r\n\r\ndag = DAG(\r\n    'test_dag',\r\n    default_args=default_args,\r\n    schedule_interval='0 6 * * *'\r\n)\r\n\r\nsql = '''\r\n    SELECT id from YOUR_BIGQUERY_TABLE limit 10\r\n'''\r\n\r\ncompare_grouped_event = TestOperator(\r\n    task_id='test_operator',\r\n    source_conn_id='gcp_airflow',\r\n    sql=sql,\r\n    dag=dag\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOperator:\r\n```python\r\nfrom airflow.hooks.base_hook import BaseHook\r\nfrom airflow.models import BaseOperator\r\nfrom airflow.utils.decorators import apply_defaults\r\n\r\n\r\nclass TestOperator(BaseOperator):\r\n    @apply_defaults\r\n    def __init__(\r\n            self,\r\n            sql,\r\n            source_conn_id=None,\r\n            *args, **kwargs):\r\n        super(TestOperator, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)\r\n        self.sql = sql\r\n        self.source_conn_id = source_conn_id\r\n\r\n    def execute(self, context=None):\r\n        records = self._get_db_hook(self.source_conn_id).get_records(self.sql)\r\n        self.log.info('Fetched records from source')\r\n\r\n    @staticmethod\r\n    def _get_db_hook(conn_id):\r\n        return BaseHook.get_hook(conn_id=conn_id)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\nBtw, I already fixed it locally, but it will break for others...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/368132910/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/368160555","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3072#issuecomment-368160555","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3072","id":368160555,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2ODE2MDU1NQ==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-23T22:47:02Z","updated_at":"2018-02-23T22:47:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#
