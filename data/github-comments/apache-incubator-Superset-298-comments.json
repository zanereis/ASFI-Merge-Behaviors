But if we change hyphen to dot, then also there is a problem. We won't be able to give 180+.\r\nIs there any other type of charts that supports this requirement and allow us to group days. I am a newbie to Superset and last month, I got another requirement like this. Then I tried this kind of alternatives and got a workaround. But later on I saw there is an option in Superset to create time series bar chart and it supports my requirement. Then I changed the previous work-around and changed the chart type from bar chart to time series bar chart.

That proposal is really impressive and I look forward to seeing the results. There's a lot there and I may have missed something but I didn't see any impact on grouping charts/dashboards although it looks like search in general is improved. What I would like (and don't see in that proposal) is a way for me to put charts/dashboards for, say \"Marketing\" or \"Finance\" in one directory, or apply different tags, so that I can limit my search/list display appropriately. Even though Search is improved in that proposal I don't see a way to limit to a cross-cutting subset of my charts/dashboards. Maybe this could be done by artificially creating duplicates of underlying data references, one per discriminating category value, but that would be sub-optimal.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/614783859/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/614822165","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/2731#issuecomment-614822165","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/2731","id":614822165,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxNDgyMjE2NQ==","user":{"login":"andrewmusselman","id":692523,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjUyMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/692523?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewmusselman","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewmusselman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewmusselman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewmusselman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewmusselman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewmusselman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewmusselman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewmusselman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewmusselman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewmusselman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewmusselman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-16T18:28:44Z","updated_at":"2020-04-16T18:29:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I have a role with these permissions but the /resetmypassword/form URL 404s.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncan this form post on ResetMyPasswordView,\r\ncan this form get on ResetMyPasswordView, \r\ncan userinfo on UserDBModelView, \r\nresetmypassword on UserDBModelView\r\n```\r\nCan anyone help get a password reset?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/614822165/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/614878133","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/9560#issuecomment-614878133","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/9560","id":614878133,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxNDg3ODEzMw==","user":{"login":"villebro","id":33317356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzE3MzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33317356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro","html_url":"https://github.com/villebro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-16T20:29:25Z","updated_at":"2020-04-16T20:29:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think one of the more fundamental problems here is that `viz.py` is raising `Exception` for all problems, making it very difficult to distinguish between serious and less serious problems.
