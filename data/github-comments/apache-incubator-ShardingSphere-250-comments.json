And I found that ```SetAutoCommit``` is a beginning  of a local transaction that shardingsphere is used to mark the current connection is ```inTransaction``` since ```java.sql.Connection``` does not have a ```begin()``` method.\r\n\r\nif transaction type is ```LOCAL```, localTransactionManger just to call ```setAutoCommit(false)``` in all backend databases in ```begin()``` method. And if transaction type is not ```LOCAL``` and shardingTransactionManager is set. The ```shardingTransactionManager.begin()``` will be invoked. I think understand the logic of ```SetAutoCommit``` here, is it right ? @terrymanu \r\n\r\nSo I think we have to process the ```xa_start``` with\r\n```\r\nif (connection.isInTransaction()) {\r\n    commit(); // commit a transaction in current connection\r\n}\r\n\r\nconnection.setInXA(true); // set current connection in XA mode\r\nbroadcast(); // pass the xa_start to all of the backend database\r\n```\r\n\r\nin ```xa_commit``` and ```xa_rollback```\r\n```\r\nconnection.setInXA(false);\r\nbroadcast(); \r\n```\r\nAnd in all of other local transaction operations the following check should be applied\r\n```\r\nif (connection.isInXA()) {\r\n    throw RuntimeException(\"There is a pending XA transaction

the help of @zjcnb, I confirmed the two questions corresponding to this issue. The first question is the JAR package that I used in the custom sharding algorithm class used in `CLASS_BASE`, and the `org.apache.shardingsphere:shardingsphere-jdbc-core-spring-boot-starter` is `5.0.0-beta`, which does not correspond to the `5.0.0-RC1` version of `ShardingSphere-Proxy` running this JAR, so use it instead This problem was first confirmed after `ShardingSphere-Proxy` `5.0.0-beta`.\r\n\r\nThe second problem is the situation mentioned in the article of this issue. Running `start.bat` under the `Windows` platform, can only connect to the local `zookeeper` `3.7.0`, and cannot connect to the cloud server's `zookeeper` `3.7.0`. After multiple `Windows` environment tests, it remains the same.\r\n\r\nWhen starting `start.sh` in the Linux environment, it can connect to the cloud's `zookeeper` `3.7.0` normally. I ensured that the JDK used by the `windows` and `linux` environments are both `Eclipse Adoptium` `8u302`, tested three sets of `ShardingSphere-Proxy` instances and two sets of `zookeeper` instances, and verified them on three devices.\r\n\r\nI confirmed that `digest` is normally verified by `ShardingSphere-Proxy` `5.0.0-beta`, this is no problem. After @zjcnb verification, `ShardingSphere-Proxy` `5.0.0-RC1` started normally. There is no special problem with `start.sh`, and there are still problems with the `start.bat` of testing `ShardingSphere-Proxy` `5.0.0-RC1` under my `windows 10`.\r\n\r\nThe error message under the `windows` platform is as follows.(In order to facilitate the display of the issue, I still use `127.0.0.1` to replace the `ip` of `log`)\r\n```shell\r\n[INFO ] 2021-10-29 22:21:55.339 [Curator-Framework-0] o.a.c.f.imps.CuratorFrameworkImpl -
