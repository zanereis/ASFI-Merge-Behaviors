Bear with us!\n\nIn the meantime you can easily run from source, directly on the current master if you feel like a pioneer, or make yourself a version by starting from `airbnb_prod` and cherry picking the commits you need.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/182617621/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/182619421","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/983#issuecomment-182619421","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/983","id":182619421,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MjYxOTQyMQ==","user":{"login":"criccomini","id":167569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzU2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/167569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini","html_url":"https://github.com/criccomini","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-10T22:53:35Z","updated_at":"2016-02-10T22:53:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@0xR curious, are you using the BQ airflow stuff?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/182619421/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/182622777","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/977#issuecomment-182622777","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/977","id":182622777,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MjYyMjc3Nw==","user":{"login":"nicktrav","id":804457,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNDQ1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/804457?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktrav","html_url":"https://github.com/nicktrav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktrav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktrav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktrav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktrav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktrav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktrav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktrav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktrav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktrav/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-10T22:58:41Z","updated_at":"2016-02-10T22:58:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mistercrunch - I tested your changes locally and it looks good.

One is in the heartbeat method of the jobs module. That one is responsible for the huge number of idle in transaction connections. Calling settings.engine.dispose() in the heartbeat method seems to keep the number of these idle in transaction connections from growing unboundedly although 1000 active task instances still keeps about 300 DB connections busy at all times with the heartbeat. \n\nThe other main source of leaks is in the TaskInstance class. Once I've dealt with the leak in jobs.py the number of \"idle\" connections begins to grown unboundedly until all connections run out and tasks start getting bounced. I've tried disposing the engine in a few key methods of that class but the session handling there is less straightforward and I haven't been able to figure it out

Since workers scale out they should be extremely aggressive about letting go of DB connections. It looks like closing the session is not enough to close out the connections you actually need to dispose of the engine. I think I was able to pinpoint the culprit that was responsible for eating up connections ad infinitum. It was actually the TaskInstance class that was generating idle unclosed connections. Once I patched it, things got relatively under control. I will PR these changes some time this week. \n\nThe heartbeat code still generates 1 idle_in_transaction connection per worker pretty much constantly. I was surprised to see this as I had switched the heartbeat to 60 seconds and dispose of the connections aggressively. I haven't had time to sort this out yet. It would be good to get this sorted as I want to be able to scale to about 6000 cores.\n\nOne thing that I noticed was that the session handling inside the airflow code isn't super consistent. Sometimes there is a centrally managed session and sometimes spurious sessions are created within methods. In general Sqlalchemy encourages session handling to be done centrally in a wrapper: http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/session_basics.html#session-frequently-asked-questions\nrather than in individual methods.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/184316651/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/184369591","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/988#issuecomment-184369591","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/988","id":184369591,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4NDM2OTU5MQ==","user":{"login":"r39132","id":581734,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MTczNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/581734?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132","html_url":"https://github.com/r39132","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-15T20:15:12Z","updated_at":"2016-02-15T20:15:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing for lack of activity.

Make sure you run everything on UTC -- Airflow does not handle non-UTC dates in a clear way at all and in fact caused me scratch my head as I saw an 8 hour delay in my triggered dag_runs actually executing. \n2. When you use the TriggerDagRunOperator, there are 2 DAGs being executed: the Controller and the Target. Both DAGs must be enabled. The Target DAG should have a `schedule_interval=None` \n\n**Illustrative Example:**\n**Step 1** : Define your Target DAG with `schedule_interval=None`. DAG_RUNs of this target will be created and executed every time that your trigger fires. \n\n```\nfrom airflow.operators import *\nfrom airflow.models import DAG\nfrom datetime import date, datetime, time, timedelta\n\nargs = {\n    'start_date': datetime.now(),\n    'owner': 'airflow',\n}\n\ndag = DAG(\n    dag_id='simple_dummy_dag_v1',\n    default_args=args,\n    schedule_interval=None)\n\n\nrun_this = DummyOperator(\n    task_id='run_this',\n    dag=dag)\n```\n\n**Step 2** : Define your Controller DAG with any interval that makes sense for you! It's going to be checking a condition on that interval and triggering the Target DAG whenever the condition is met. In the example below, I am running it every minute and always executing the trigger. The idea of the `foo` function is to check a condition and then return dag_run_obj if you want to trigger the Target DAG. If your condition is not met, then return None.\n\n```\nfrom airflow import DAG, utils\nfrom airflow.operators import *\nfrom datetime import date, datetime, time, timedelta\n\n\ndef foo(context, dag_run_obj):\n    if True:\n        return dag_run_obj\n\ndag = DAG(dag_id='test_trigger_dag_run_for_Sid',\n          default_args={\"owner\" : \"me\",\n                        \"start_date\":datetime.now()},\n          schedule_interval='*/1 * * * *')\n\ntrigger = TriggerDagRunOperator(task_id='test_trigger_dagrun',\n                                trigger_dag_id=\"simple_dummy_dag_v1\",\n                                python_callable=foo,\n                                dag=dag\n```\n\n**Optional Step 3** : You can also manually trigger your Target DAG using the CLI, perhaps when testing or if you are using some custom automation via `trigger_dag simple_dummy_dag_v1`\n\nYour DAG_Run table will look like : \n\n<img width=\"910\" alt=\"screenshot 2016-02-15 23 00 17\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/581734/13062616/ebe3b9b0-d437-11e5-8311-8ed7fe412344.png\">\n\nYou can see 3 types of entries (from top to bottom): \n- Manually triggered (via CLI) DAG_RUNs of the Target DAG (e.g. `run_id : manual__2016-02-15T22:57:49.996114`)\n- Controller triggered DAG_RUNs of the Target DAG (e.g. `run_id : trig__2016-02-15T22:26:37.425566`)\n- Controller DAG_RUNs (e.g. `run_id : scheduled__2016-02-15T11:15:00`)\n\nThe documentation sucks. Please do your part and update it as and when questions are answered. I can do this one. Closing for now, but ping me here or on gitter if you need it reopened.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/184434516/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/184434787","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/990#issuecomment-184434787","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/990","id":184434787,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4NDQzNDc4Nw==","user":{"login":"r39132","id":581734,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MTczNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/581734?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132","html_url":"https://github.com/r39132","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-15T23:06:28Z","updated_at":"2016-02-15T23:06:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Are you running in UTC everywhere?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/184434787/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/184444552","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/969#issuecomment-184444552","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/969","id":184444552,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4NDQ0NDU1Mg==","user":{"login":"r39132","id":581734,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MTczNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/581734?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132","html_url":"https://github.com/r39132","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-15T23:50:37Z","updated_at":"2016-02-15T23:50:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @kretes, \n`[2016-02-08 15:55:25,118] {__init__.py:36} INFO - Using executor CeleryExecutor` is misleading.
