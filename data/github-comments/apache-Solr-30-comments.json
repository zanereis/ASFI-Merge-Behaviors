Why does the LBSolrClient need to maintain a separate set of query params? LBHttp2SolrClient already receives a Http2SolrClient which ideally would have been init with correct query params. any (now deprecated) method to modify query params would just delegate to Http2SolrClient instance. I would cautiously suggest to remove the extra set of query params, which would also simplify a bit the code.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1366816568/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1366828996","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1253#issuecomment-1366828996","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1253","id":1366828996,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5ReCfE","user":{"login":"stillalex","id":61026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMDI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stillalex","html_url":"https://github.com/stillalex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stillalex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stillalex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stillalex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stillalex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stillalex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stillalex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stillalex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stillalex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stillalex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-28T18:03:27Z","updated_at":"2022-12-28T18:03:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"proposal for DelegationTokenHttpSolrClient: \r\n* move constructor 'setQueryParams(' call to Builder itself. the call comes from the builder already, so no added complexity https://github.com/apache/solr/blob/0f912f6b84c6b0a42079df2479ac6bbecc3c2c67/solr/solrj/src/java/org/apache/solr/client/solrj/impl/DelegationTokenHttpSolrClient.java#L40\r\n* mark setQueryParams method deprecated\r\nI think this should be it. in the future we can remove the DelegationTokenHttpSolrClient#setQueryParams method and the query params will already have the expected param because the builder injected it at build time.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1366828996/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1366894780","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1253#issuecomment-1366894780","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1253","id":1366894780,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5ReSi8","user":{"login":"epugh","id":22395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh","html_url":"https://github.com/epugh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-28T20:16:40Z","updated_at":"2022-12-28T20:17:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> LBHttp2SolrClient\r\n\r\n@stillalex  Would you be interested in pushing up a commit to this PR to make this change to remove the method?

So, it feels like you have two potential PR's, one on the contributing to solr and the other on moving various `/help/*.txt` files out into proper `.adoc` formatted docs.

At this point I only moved the IDE and JVM ones since those seem the most relevant to getting started with contributing.

I've migrated to the Builder all the examples where we create a new SolrCloudClient, so it's easy to add the builder logic.   The remaining ones all basically are reusing a SolrClient inherited from the base test class.   For example, in `TestTrackingShardHandlerFactory` we have the method:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncluster.getSolrClient().setDefaultCollection(COLLECTION);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think what we could change is to have a method like `cluster.getSolrClientForCollection(COLLECTION)` and it looks up a map of SolrClients by collection name, and if it has it, returns it, and if it doesn't have it, then creates it.   Then in our cleanup code we shut them all down?   \r\n\r\nAlternatively, we could just create our CloudSolrClient right there, and not try to reuse them.  Then we could introduce more try/with resources patterns in those tests....?

New Year! \r\n\r\nI updated this PR with an integration test similar to the one in `JaegerTracerConfigurator`, starting the tracer in a cluster, see 86dd6c0ac2e5c8b7f404b17937901d374bb4a10e.\r\n\r\nI then discovered that the OTEL tracer was not being closed correctly, and there was a leaking background thread from the batch span exporter. Turned out that OTEL's [OpenTracing Shim](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/tree/main/opentracing-shim) class by design [will not close the actual tracer](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/blob/v1.21.0/opentracing-shim/src/main/java/io/opentelemetry/opentracingshim/TracerShim.java#L98), so when `CoreContainer#shutdown()` is called, the tracer is left open.\r\n\r\nThe workaround I chose is to wrap the `TracerShim` in a thin `ClosableTracerShim` delegate class that will properly close the tracer through the SDK.

I think having a different ctor is probably a right step, though it might be hard to convince the Solr community to adapt that as they don't see PRS as something to be enabled by default so far?

This is not supported by KNN today but could be.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1370501863/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1370580585","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1168#issuecomment-1370580585","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1168","id":1370580585,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5RsWZp","user":{"login":"janhoy","id":409128,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTEyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/409128?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy","html_url":"https://github.com/janhoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-04T07:47:11Z","updated_at":"2023-01-04T07:47:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the review. I just updated to the latest version of opentelementry.\r\n\r\nThe contents of `modules/opentelemetry/lib/` folder now totals ~10Mb, see list below.\r\nI made an attempt to slim it down by excluding `opentelemetry-sdk-logs`, `opentelemetry-sdk-metrics` (since we only use trace), but the auto-configuration mode we use to support configuration by ENV variable has hard dependencies on them during initialization. Also I thought we could skip support for JSON/HTTP and only do protobuf/gRPC (using netty), but for similar reasons I could not.\r\n\r\nSo even if I don't like the weight increase I'm voting for shipping this, giving users a choice between transports. Perhaps also in a later release we can try to activate OTLP metrics and logs export in this module.\r\n\r\n```\r\n 20K    annotations-13.0.jar\r\n4.0K    annotations-4.1.1.4.jar\r\n256K    grpc-api-1.50.2.jar\r\n 32K    grpc-context-1.50.2.jar\r\n716K    grpc-core-1.50.2.jar\r\n276K    grpc-netty-1.50.2.jar\r\n8.0K    grpc-protobuf-1.50.2.jar\r\n8.0K    grpc-protobuf-lite-1.50.2.jar\r\n 52K    grpc-stub-1.50.2.jar\r\n260K    gson-2.9.1.jar\r\n1.5M    kotlin-stdlib-1.7.21.jar\r\n208K    kotlin-stdlib-common-1.7.21.jar\r\n 48K    kotlin-stdlib-jdk7-1.7.21.jar\r\n 20K    kotlin-stdlib-jdk8-1.7.21.jar\r\n632K    netty-codec-http-4.1.82.Final.jar\r\n464K    netty-codec-http2-4.1.82.Final.jar\r\n120K    netty-codec-socks-4.1.82.Final.jar\r\n 24K    netty-handler-proxy-4.1.82.Final.jar\r\n768K    okhttp-4.10.0.jar\r\n344K    okio-jvm-3.0.0.jar\r\n128K    opentelemetry-api-1.21.0.jar\r\n 12K    opentelemetry-api-logs-1.21.0-alpha.jar\r\n 48K    opentelemetry-context-1.21.0.jar\r\n 88K    opentelemetry-exporter-common-1.21.0.jar\r\n 32K    opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-1.21.0.jar\r\n108K    opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-common-1.21.0.jar\r\n 32K    opentelemetry-opentracing-shim-1.21.0-alpha.jar\r\n8.0K    opentelemetry-sdk-1.21.0.jar\r\n 40K    opentelemetry-sdk-common-1.21.0.jar\r\n 48K    opentelemetry-sdk-extension-autoconfigure-1.21.0-alpha.jar\r\n 20K    opentelemetry-sdk-extension-autoconfigure-spi-1.21.0.jar\r\n 44K    opentelemetry-sdk-logs-1.21.0-alpha.jar\r\n280K    opentelemetry-sdk-metrics-1.21.0.jar\r\n116K    opentelemetry-sdk-trace-1.21.0.jar\r\n 36K    opentelemetry-semconv-1.21.0-alpha.jar\r\n8.0K    perfmark-api-0.25.0.jar\r\n1.7M    proto-google-common-protos-2.9.2.jar\r\n1.6M    protobuf-java-3.21.12.jar\r\n 20K    solr-opentelemetry-10.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar\r\n10M\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1370580585/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1370582267","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1168#issuecomment-1370582267","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1168","id":1370582267,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5RsWz7","user":{"login":"janhoy","id":409128,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTEyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/409128?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy","html_url":"https://github.com/janhoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-04T07:49:41Z","updated_at":"2023-01-04T07:49:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"PS: Imagine if Java had a http-client abstraction lib, like slf4j for logs.

The first one is the most obvious and straightforward: you use it as KNN per si, i.e. you bring the top K documents most similar to the target. \r\n\r\nThe second way to use the KNN is to use the _similarity score_ that is calculated with the vectors. In this case we use the vectors and their similarity for _ranking_ instead of _retrieval_. And there are some use cases that we could even combine multiple similarity scores to create an aggregated score, or even combine the similarity score with the actual \"lexical score\" (BM25). For this second use case we often use a very high K to guarantee that we calculate the similarity score for _all_ the relevant documents.\r\n\r\nSo, considering this second use case of using the KNN for calculating the similarity score, having the ability to filter the documents based on the value of the similarity is very useful. And as previously mentioned, sometimes this is not even directly a single similarity score, it could be a combination of multiple scores, and we could apply the Post Filter on top of the aggregated score.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1370930774/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1371092716","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1168#issuecomment-1371092716","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1168","id":1371092716,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5RuTbs","user":{"login":"janhoy","id":409128,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTEyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/409128?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy","html_url":"https://github.com/janhoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-04T15:44:08Z","updated_at":"2023-01-04T15:44:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I have now also tested locally, exporting to a local otel-collector, on both default grpc, port 4317 and with `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=http/protobuf` on port 4318.

But it would be good to see a test just start a cloud with compression enabled, create a collection and make sure it is compressed by fetching the data from ZK.\r\n> \r\n> Also for upgrade notes, this feature should not be enabled until all Solr Nodes are running a version of Solr that supports it.\r\n\r\nThanks for taking a look @HoustonPutman, one of the reasons we chose ZLib compression is because tools like [zk-shell](https://github.com/rgs1/zk_shell) can handle it natively when doing a get on a compressed state.json. Also since this is done in ZKStateReader it is handled across Solr including Admin pages and Solr CLI, which hopefully helps alleviate some of the concern. There is certainly some tradeoff here in terms of manual modification of state, but we've found value in this for very large collections to keep files in ZK small.\r\n\r\n+1 on upgrade notes and I'll follow up on additional tests and the other comments you provided.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1373888188/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1374073171","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1274#issuecomment-1374073171","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1274","id":1374073171,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5R5rFT","user":{"login":"mkhludnev","id":807522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/807522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkhludnev","html_url":"https://github.com/mkhludnev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkhludnev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkhludnev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkhludnev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkhludnev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkhludnev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkhludnev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkhludnev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkhludnev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkhludnev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-06T20:07:48Z","updated_at":"2023-01-06T20:07:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@metapox can you confirm that you run tests?

This is encrypting with private key and verifying with public key. There are signatures for that instead. Not sure why its done this way, but it MIGHT be that the whole `NoPadding` stuff is really just working around using the right cryptography approach of a
