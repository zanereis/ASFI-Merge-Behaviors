Yes, it's indirectly related to NIFI-5044. If pre/post query statement is added to SelectHiveQuery, then statements such as 'set x=y' or 'add jar..' would be written there and will not be passed to findTableNames method I assume.\r\n\r\nHowever, for PutHiveQL, such queries can be bundled in the same FlowFile content. I filtered out only 'set x=y' statement, but it's not enough. 'add jar ...' fails similarly. Moreover, if we're going to filter out those commands, we need to care all commands in this wiki page I guess.\r\nhttps://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+Cli\r\nIt requires something like CommandProcessorFactory.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hive/blob/master/ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/processors/CommandProcessorFactory.java#L51\r\n\r\nThat will be overkill for this JIRA and findTableNames purpose.

When we call super.stateChanged(), that will throw CancelLeadershipException, which in turn is supposed to interrupt our listener. We followed the \"Error Handling\" guidance provided by Apache Curator: https://curator.apache.org/curator-recipes/leader-election.html\r\n\r\nSo we are handling the SUSPENDED and LOST scenarios as is recommended. And this works 99% of the time. Unfortunately, we do occasionally see scenarios where it does not interrupt the thread and as such the node believes that it retains the lock. It's not clear, when this happens, if the thread just wasn't interrupted for some reason, or if the notification of SUSPENDED/LOST never was received, or what exactly is occurring that prevents our ElectionListener from being interrupted.\r\n\r\nThat's why I went with the solution of periodically polling ZooKeeper, to check the state. That way, whatever the cause of the thread not being interrupted, we still will break out.

I commented above re: the use of Expression Language in the property descriptor.\r\nI do still feel like the check for 'record tag names' is unnecessary, as the reader should not be responsible for filtering the data but rather just for reading it. There already exist mechanisms for filtering the data (You could use PartitionRecord + RouteOnAttribute, ValidateRecord, or QueryRecord just off the top of my head to achieve this). Additionally, we have the Schema for the Record Reader. So if the element name matches the top-level Schema name (or one of them, if the top-level field is a UNION/CHOICE element), then we could use that. So, with your example above, if you only want to read the `<record/><record/>` part, your schema should indicate that the top-level field name is `record`. In that case, it should filter out the `other` record. Does that make sense?

The embedded key fields do not have to be defined, its values only have to be of the defined type for the map. \r\n\r\nIf the reader is used with (coerce==false && dropUnknown==true), the reader will parse all fields that exist in the schema ignoring its type. However, the data above will not be parsable even if the map exists in the schema. In this case, the reader identifies \"map_field\" as a field that exists in the schema, but the reader is not aware that it is of type map. Therefore, the reader will not parse the embedded key fields, as they don't exist in the schema. The field \"map_field\" will be classified as an empty field and not added to the record.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, even if the reader is used with (coerce==false && dropUnknown==true), it will be type-aware to some extent. The reader first checks, whether fields exist in the schema. If that is the case, the reader additionally will check whether they are of type record (or of type array embedding records, respectively). If that is also the case, the reader will retrieve the subschema in order to be enabled to check whether subtags of the current tag are known. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/383221841/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/383240130","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2634#issuecomment-383240130","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2634","id":383240130,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MzI0MDEzMA==","user":{"login":"ijokarumawak","id":1107620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak","html_url":"https://github.com/ijokarumawak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-20T22:38:34Z","updated_at":"2018-04-20T22:38:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thank you, @markap14, you are right, I thought I pushed it but didn't.
