Your AD require you to pass @domainName; I understand in some of the cases, depending on how you have configured AD, it requires you to pass \"@domainName\". And in your case this seem to be the issue, and hence when you pass  randerson with @company.com, it works.\n2. Roles are not being assigned to the user; for this, here is what I recommend\n   - make sure you have something like this configured in you shiro.ini `activeDirectoryRealm.groupRolesMap = \"CN=admin,OU=groups,DC=SOME_GROUP,DC=COMPANY,DC=COM\":\"admin\",\"CN=finance,OU=groups,DC=SOME_GROUP,DC=COMPANY,DC=COM\":\"finance\",\"CN=hr,OU=groups,DC=SOME_GROUP,DC=COMPANY,DC=COM\":\"hr\"`\n   - and corresponding to each group you have a roles entry in shiro.ini\n   \n   ```\n   [roles]\n   admin = *\n   hr = *\n   finance = *\n   group1 = *\n   ```\n\nFor your reference here is my shiro.ini, and on this configured AD server both `zeppelin` and `zeppelin@SUB.MYDOMAIN.COM` user work fine. Let me know if this resolves the issue.\n\n```\n[main]\nactiveDirectoryRealm = org.apache.zeppelin.server.ActiveDirectoryGroupRealm\nactiveDirectoryRealm.principalSuffix =

Currently, \n\nA. user can create single interpreter setting and create two configuration for both hive and mysql connection. And select connection via %jdbc(hive) or %jdbc(mysql).\nB. or user can create two interpreter setting and each interpreter setting have configuration for hive and mysql connection. In this case, selecting jdbc connection is limited and annoying, because a notebook can not use two or more same type of interpreter settings at the same time. So user have to constantly bind/unbind interpreter setting to switch hive <-> mysql.\n\nIf our long term plan is generalize ZEPPELIN-999 and allow user use interpreter setting alias for interpreter selection, like %hive, %mysql, then all disadvantages of approach **B** will be eliminated.\n\nManaging only single jdbc connection in single interpreter setting, with generalized ZEPPELIN-999 will give advantages, like leverage [interpreter authorization](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-945).

I really appreciate your work. The activeDirectoryRealm.principalSuffix works now.  I do have some concerns about the number of ldap calls made and the amount of data pulled back.\n\n It looks like the app:\n1) makes ldap bindRequest as null@mydomain.com and fails.\n2) makes ldap bindRequest as username@mydomain.com and succeeds.\n3) makes a bindRequest as activeDirectoryRealm.systemUsername@mydomain.com and succeeds\n4) does a searchRequest for the wholeSubTree\n\nStep 4 pulls back about 5mb of data, which is a lot.  Could add quite a lot of load to AD, if lots of users are simultaneously using the UI...  I can limit the result set by more fully qualifying the activeDirectoryRealm.searchBase, however, then it seems to miss the group data.  Seems like there should really just be only be a couple lightweight calls.\n1) bind the username\n2) pull back the group memberships for username (if step one was a success).\n\nNot sure if there's a more concise way to make these queries in java.  I can do it via command line the following way: ldapsearch -xLLL -h ldapServer -b \"dc=company,dc=com\" -D \"CN=LDAP Bind,OU=Special,Accounts,DC=company,DC=com\" -W uid=randerson.  This returns everything about the uid: randerson, including all group memberships.  The total size of the data is 60k... \n\nIn addition, my groups / roles are still not mapped to my username, regardless of if the app searches the whole tree or not.  I'm not sure why.

It kind of defeats the benefits of having a type system.\n\nIt's not a strong opinion though, and if after this arguments, you still feel that having single one is better - please let me know.\n\nOther that discussed minor issue - it looks great to
