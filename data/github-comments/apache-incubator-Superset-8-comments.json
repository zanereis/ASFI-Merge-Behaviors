I thought about the same but didn't find any implementation in the current code to disable UI features based on access controls. I have updated and tested the code for disabling the button (basically calling appbuilder functions in the template). I don't see a need for {{ \"disabled\" if can_add }}. We can simply add it in the if condition to show the button or not. And now the backend handles the same as well. Let me know if you need further modifications in the way its implemented in this PR. I will then create another PR to do the same for some other important features like - save dashboard, download csv.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/208181154/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/208239652","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/241#issuecomment-208239652","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/241","id":208239652,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwODIzOTY1Mg==","user":{"login":"csalperwyck","id":10532567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTMyNTY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10532567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/csalperwyck","html_url":"https://github.com/csalperwyck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csalperwyck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csalperwyck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csalperwyck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csalperwyck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csalperwyck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csalperwyck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csalperwyck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csalperwyck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csalperwyck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-11T08:59:13Z","updated_at":"2016-04-11T08:59:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"+1 for Hive\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/208239652/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/208248702","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/252#issuecomment-208248702","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/252","id":208248702,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwODI0ODcwMg==","user":{"login":"roymondliao","id":8049009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNDkwMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8049009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roymondliao","html_url":"https://github.com/roymondliao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roymondliao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roymondliao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roymondliao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roymondliao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roymondliao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roymondliao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roymondliao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roymondliao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roymondliao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-11T09:25:55Z","updated_at":"2016-04-11T09:25:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I have the same problem after clicking save button and my database is mysql.

Go to your Redshift dashboard > Parameter Groups and create a new cluster parameter group (or modify an existing one). In it, change the `search_path` property to include the schemas you want. \n\nPlease also note: setting a search path in parameter groups sets it for the entire cluster (for all users). In case of duplicate names, an unqualified table name in a query (i.e. tables called simply as `<table>` instead of `<schema>.<table>`) will default to the one that appears first in the search path (which may or may not be what you want, depending on how you use schemas). \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/208615479/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/208653518","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/327#issuecomment-208653518","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/327","id":208653518,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwODY1MzUxOA==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-12T01:15:57Z","updated_at":"2016-04-12T01:15:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/builds/5748888/badge)](https://coveralls.io/builds/5748888)\n\nCoverage decreased (-0.09%) to 72.44% when pulling **797d41bf0413541c01fe2e464f4351c411212885 on fix_sql** into **6d0b5767b3a74b23bf248fcfc2cd270233af95a9 on master**.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/208653518/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/208682141","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/298#issuecomment-208682141","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/298","id":208682141,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwODY4MjE0MQ==","user":{"login":"sid88in","id":1587005,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODcwMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1587005?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sid88in","html_url":"https://github.com/sid88in","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sid88in/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sid88in/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sid88in/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sid88in/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sid88in/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sid88in/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sid88in/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sid88in/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sid88in/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-12T02:55:21Z","updated_at":"2016-04-12T02:57:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"My bad.

I agree with you that altering the global search path can only be done by admins. Users can set their own search path in a session with `set search_path to schema1, schema2, public;`. I don't know if we can supply some pre-load statements to Caravel that are applied once as soon as a connection is established. If so, that might be a good place to do this (and maybe set other things like timeout).\n\nI hadn't tested mine with `schema.table` (I used the unqualified names for the tables in different schemas) since we don't have duplicated names, so that might be something I missed.
