I am on your side! The following enhancement looks good to me. I know some users implement this interface for their scenarios, but\r\n- We have some default implements for users' choice\r\n- Your proposal does not change the API for encrypting configuration\r\n- It's a great enhancement for the encryption feature\r\n- Avoid complicated judgment and handling in our project\r\n\r\nBased on these reasons, I prefer to do direct modification to the previous interface. What do you think? @cheese8 I am looking forward to this wonderful enhancement! I assigned this issue to you, if you think we need more other discussion, please speak up here.\r\n\r\n```\r\nString encrypt(Object plaintext, Map<String, Object>
