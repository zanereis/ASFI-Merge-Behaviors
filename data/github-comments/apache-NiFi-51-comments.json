I was running it against NiFi 1.0.0. The client I was working for at the time was using a few non-standard HL7 messages that were resulting in exceptions. The exceptions weren't really the problem (the failed messages just require specialized processing). The real problem was that the exceptions thrown were not HL7Exceptions so the NiFi processor didn't know where to route the message and the flowfile stayed in the queue to be processed at a later time. We were handling a large volume of these messages so the processor quickly got overloaded with the flowfile backlog. We ended up fixing this locally by simply routing all exceptions to failure so that the flowfiles would be moved out of the queue. I understand @mattyb149's point about how catching all exceptions could lead to data loss. Unfortunately I no longer have access to the messages or workflows that are failing so I'll go ahead and close this request.

Everything functions correctly but behind the scenes we were recording observers for the NONE log level because the observers are registered according to the severity. For instance, configuring for INFO will register an observer for INFO, WARN, ERROR, etc. The tweak I'm proposing would be to not register an observer for NONE since that is not really a true log level (no component will ever log a message to the NONE level).

I can see how it improves execution time of generated SQL. This enhancement is significant for the first execution of GenerateTableFetch processor if there are many records to fetch. The performance difference is huge!\r\n\r\nFor the 2nd time or later, GenerateTableFetch uses 'where' clause using 'Max value columns' so it will not be a problem after 1st run if the max value columns are properly indexed.

However, I think the implication of the using the `RequiresInstanceClassLoading` annotation with the `cloneDuringInstanceClassLoading` flag on an NAR could lead to some confusing deployments. I think the confusion will come from the fact that the flag on the NAR will only be honored when the entire chain from the component that `RequiresInstanceClassLoading` is also flagged. Rather than trying to identify cases that could be problematic like forgetting the flag in a NAR in the chain or setting the flag on a NAR that contains a service API, should we investigate a way to automatically clone when possible?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/290776042/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/290786778","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1635#issuecomment-290786778","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1635","id":290786778,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MDc4Njc3OA==","user":{"login":"bbende","id":605416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTQxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende","html_url":"https://github.com/bbende","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-31T18:10:08Z","updated_at":"2017-03-31T18:10:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mcgilman Thanks for the review. I definitely agree that the current use of `cloneDuringInstanceClassLoading` allows for some confusing situations to arise and makes it challenging for the framework to try and prevent incorrect/unexpected behavior.\r\n\r\nThinking about this some more... the main reason for creating that flag was because at component creation time we only have the class name (String) and bundle for the component, and we need to make a decision about how far to go up the class loader hierarchy when cloning resources. \r\n\r\nIf we had an instance of the component already then we could use the same logic we have in other places where we look at the property descriptors that reference controller service APIs, and determine which bundle they came from, and then stop cloning resources when that bundle is reached. We already have temp instances of every component when performing the service loading so we could potentially cache these instances to do a lookup by className+bundle, and possibly even replace a lot of our other temp component creation with look ups to these temp instances.\r\n\r\nIf we did the above we would be more aggressively cloning class loader resources, essentially always cloning until we see controller service API references. For cases where we don't want this behavior we could possibly change the meaning of `cloneDuringInstanceClassLoading`. It could instead be used on the NAR where the component with `@RequiresInstanceClassLoading` lives to indicate that the ancestor resources should be considered (stopping at first CS API as described above). If `cloneDuringInstanceClassLoading` isn't provided or is set to false, then a component with `@RequiresInstanceClassLoading` only gets a copy of it's own NAR resources.\r\n\r\nExample 1 - `PutHDFS` has `@RequiresInstanceClassLoading` and `nifi-hadoop-nar` has `cloneDuringInstanceClassLoading` set to true, so the `InstanceClassLoader` for `PutHDFS` gets all the resources from `nifi-hadoop-nar` back to the first NAR that has a CS API referenced by` PutHDFS`, or back to `nifi-jetty-nar` (exclusive).\r\n\r\nExample 2 - `HBaseClientService_1_1_2` has `@RequiresInstanceClassLoading` and `nifi-hbase-client-service-1-1-2-nar` does not have `cloneDuringInstanceClassLoading`, so the `InstanceClassLoader` for `HBaseClientService_1_1_2` gets only the resources from `nifi-hbase-client-service-1-1-2`.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/290786778/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/290788013","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1639#issuecomment-290788013","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1639","id":290788013,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MDc4ODAxMw==","user":{"login":"bbende","id":605416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTQxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende","html_url":"https://github.com/bbende","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-31T18:14:43Z","updated_at":"2017-03-31T18:14:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@trixpan I'll take a look when I get some free time, have a few other things going on at the moment.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/290788013/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/290875777","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1640#issuecomment-290875777","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1640","id":290875777,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MDg3NTc3Nw==","user":{"login":"trixpan","id":3108527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMDg1Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3108527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan","html_url":"https://github.com/trixpan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-01T00:10:27Z","updated_at":"2017-04-01T00:10:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mattyb149 -

If an onTrigger throws a ProcessException, the flowfile will be penalized and the Processor will NOT be administratively yielded. If any other type of Exception escapes, the flowfile will be penalized and the Process will be administratively yielded. I think the issue in this case is that we are only catching ProcessException. As a result all other Exceptions are escaping and causing the Processor to be yielded. I'm thinking the fix is to simply catch Exception and then rethrow ProcessException to prevent the administrative yielding.
