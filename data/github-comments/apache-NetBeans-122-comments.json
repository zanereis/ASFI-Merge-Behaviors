An the file exists (on the nbfs) in fact:\r\n```\r\n                <folder name=\"JavaApp\">\r\n                    <folder name=\"src\">\r\n                        <folder name=\"main\">\r\n                            <folder name=\"java\">\r\n                                <folder name=\"${packagePath}\">\r\n                                    <file name=\"${mainClassName}.java\" url=\"nbresloc:/org/netbeans/modules/maven/resources/App.java.template\">\r\n                                        <attr name=\"javax.script.ScriptEngine\" stringvalue=\"freemarker\"/>\r\n                                        <attr name=\"template.openFile\" boolvalue=\"true\"/>\r\n                                    </file>\r\n                                </folder>\r\n                            </folder>\r\n                        </folder>\r\n                    </folder>\r\n                </folder>\r\n```\r\nSo the templating engine (or the template) should be enhanced to properly URLencode special chars (which it does not do at the moment). The replaceable tokens are intentionally in the path to allow substitution from API call parameters.\r\n\r\nThe other issue is that the entire Java Project structure is not shown in Templates - this should be (somehow) fixed. \"Somehow\" means that the template UI (Tools | Templates dialog) isn't actually prepared for structured templates, where the user could eventually add conent etc - so some tweak will be needed to **present** the Maven-main-class template.\r\n\r\nThe reason why the Wizard does not use the \"main\" template is because the template instantiation call would invoke another New From Template wizard -- this is how those templates are registered at the moment, and that Wizard does not support being parametrized from outside *and run headless*. That *might* be fixed as well - but will be probably more tough.\r\n\r\nI can take as a Friday project the first two items (URL encoding / link fix + Templates UI appearance). I cannot promise the last at the moment - although it would be cool to be able to reuse other templates in project structure template.\r\n\r\n---\r\nThe reason behind this all was to allow to create Maven projects in a non-interactive manner, througj an API (File Templates API) and from a LSP client (that uses the programmatic access).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1192254004/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1192312559","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/4402#issuecomment-1192312559","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4402","id":1192312559,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5HET7v","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-22T08:20:29Z","updated_at":"2022-07-22T08:20:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> > i can probably fix this for final fields.

What about taking this as a chance to try some of the heavier tests on different triggers? A daily basis on certain branches, or on PR merges?\r\n\r\nsure thats all no problem in principle. The main issue is to actually split the tests up and decide what should run when. Triggering based on code paths, or even PR labels is also an option, but this has been discarded every time we had the discussion. PHP for example almost became conditionally triggered as first experiment.\r\n\r\nBut i do agree, this project runs probably ~20h of testing per sync (travis alone is 13h). Thats simply too much.

@jtulach  with the 3 commit I'm able to down the error to 0 on my own build.\r\n1) fix pattern for id and h3 [nbbuild/antsrc/org/netbeans/nbbuild/CheckLinks.java]\r\n2) remove invalid target in arch.xml/apichanges.xml (onclick is forbidden)\r\n3) move 3 files in openide awt to their correct public package\r\n4) as we use config.javadoc.stable for release, I had to append this properties with the missing modules:\r\n   openide.options,\\\r\n    editor,\\\r\n    editor.lib,\\\r\n    editor.indent,\\\r\n    editor.indent.support,\\\r\n    editor.bracesmatching,\\\r\n    editor.util\r\n\r\nStep 4 is a bit ugly but on master, we should try to edit the arch file to match the real dependencies.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1194148154/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1194150020","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/4428#issuecomment-1194150020","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4428","id":1194150020,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5HLUiE","user":{"login":"SirIntellegence","id":3401182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDExODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3401182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SirIntellegence","html_url":"https://github.com/SirIntellegence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SirIntellegence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SirIntellegence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SirIntellegence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SirIntellegence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SirIntellegence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SirIntellegence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SirIntellegence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SirIntellegence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SirIntellegence/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-25T14:48:55Z","updated_at":"2022-07-25T14:48:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Will

Diffing with the decompiler showed that lucene is doing MRJ to get some extra APIs from `java.lang.Objects` and similar earlier. If thats all they are using it for, it wouldn't even matter what version is loaded on 11+, since they provided their own \"FutureObjects\" impl for 8 obviously (looks like unnecessary complexity to me tbh, but I haven't diffed everything).\r\n\r\nThey don't track the lucene 8.x branch on github anymore, we are using an EOL version and lucene 9+ moved to JDK 11+.
