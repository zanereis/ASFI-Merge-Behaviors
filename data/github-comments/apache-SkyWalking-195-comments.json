MQTT Because the protocol header is fixed, it is impossible to pass the contextcarrier header, and the consumer cannot get it.

But I think it is a way to avoid large transaction，using this way may cause index  inconsistent \r\nsaid by pingcap member（though i can endure）I want to know if the large expire transaction comply with the design ? Will it be optimized in the future？","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/718710687/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/718726522","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/5753#issuecomment-718726522","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/5753","id":718726522,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxODcyNjUyMg==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-29T12:40:47Z","updated_at":"2020-10-29T12:40:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"You set wrong.

We provide users with trcing at one end, because the common application scenario of the MQTT protocol is on IOT. At this time, our terminals are usually IOT devices, so in this scenario we provide cloud mqtt Whether monitoring is more valuable, we can monitor the trcing of the data received by the entire cloud, and the trcing of the data sent to the terminal. This is my opinion, but if you feel that mqtt-plugin does not need to exist, it is acceptable.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/719913689/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/719928924","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/5762#issuecomment-719928924","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/5762","id":719928924,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxOTkyODkyNA==","user":{"login":"codecov[bot]","id":22429695,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjI0Mjk2OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/254?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/codecov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-31T12:44:08Z","updated_at":"2020-10-31T13:29:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#
