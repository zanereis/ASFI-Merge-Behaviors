@sanjulian , thanks for your PR. \r\nIn your pr, you add a rest api to get the version written as a static variable with name \"org.apache.kylin.common.KylinVersion#CURRENT_KYLIN_VERSION\". But we can not gurantee it is updated every time for the release, which means the version shown on UI may not be accurate.\r\n\r\nAcutually, there is another api with code \"org.apache.kylin.rest.controller.AdminController#getKylinVersions\", I think the implementation there is more resonable.

Discussion\r\n\r\n----\r\n### Why choosing this HDP3 docker image, why not use a small and custom one?\r\n\r\nFollowing is the pros and cons of why I choose this HDP3 docker image:\r\n\r\n#### Pros\r\n- It is the only all-in-one official(for official, I means **hortonworks** and **cloudera**) Hadoop3 docker image I could find, I think it should be well-test by **hortonworks** teams.\r\n- Custom hadoop docker may lack (compared to HDP image):\r\n    - Easy service monitor\r\n    - Easy configuration modify\r\n    - Standard hadoop layout (meet the convention) \r\n    - More mature combination\r\n\r\n#### Cons\r\n- The image is really big(27 GB), it not easy to download or distribute/share it.\r\n- Docker may has some unexpected problems which is annoying, but I will do my best to document them.\r\n\r\n  \r\n----\r\n### Why choose macvlan network?\r\n\r\nDocker container and develop machine should be in the same network.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/comments/604206291/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/comments/604253631","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kylin/pull/1166#issuecomment-604253631","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/1166","id":604253631,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwNDI1MzYzMQ==","user":{"login":"hit-lacus","id":14030549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDMwNTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14030549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus","html_url":"https://github.com/hit-lacus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-26T06:26:07Z","updated_at":"2020-03-30T02:22:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"##
