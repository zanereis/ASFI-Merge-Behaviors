FYI, another symptom/side effect of this bug is that a file can appear in both DirIndex#filesPresent and DirIndex#filesRemoved lists, despite the validation in the constructor. This is because `validatePresentAndRemovedOverlap` compares FileIndexes, whose `equals` also compares file permissions. So the same file with changed permissions (e.g. due to bug above) will be considered different than the remote file and be present in filesAdded (new local file) and filesRemoved (old remote file).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/1478891059/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/1481504890","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/samza/pull/1659#issuecomment-1481504890","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/1659","id":1481504890,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAetVLs5YTfh6","user":{"login":"jia-gao","id":94939653,"node_id":"U_kgDOBaiqBQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/94939653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jia-gao","html_url":"https://github.com/jia-gao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jia-gao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jia-gao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jia-gao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jia-gao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jia-gao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jia-gao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jia-gao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jia-gao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jia-gao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-23T16:27:25Z","updated_at":"2023-03-23T16:27:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"lgtm","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/1481504890/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/1500503523","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/samza/pull/1663#issuecomment-1500503523","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/1663","id":1500503523,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAetVLs5Zb93j","user":{"login":"prateekm","id":1085859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODU4NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm","html_url":"https://github.com/prateekm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-07T17:50:15Z","updated_at":"2023-04-07T17:50:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bharathkk

Please correct me if i am wrong but whatever we are trying to do thru this class can be achieved by passing `Config` object as param to RunLoop, initializing JobConfig, TaskConfig etc in the constructor and setting the member variables directly in the RunLoop constructor.\r\n> \r\n> Instead of mocking `RunLoopConfig` in tests, we could have a mock config class with mock configs set.\r\n\r\n@ajothomas \r\nGood question. That is definitely one of approaches I evaluated. Some of my thoughts on that\r\n1. We end up making constructor a bit heavy and create objects that are short lived just to initialize few fields. e.g., new TaskConfig(...), new JobConfig(...) and so-on which sort of violates DI principles where you'd want dependencies to be passed in as much as possible.\r\n2. Authoring tests and mocking components that are not plugged in through constructor is hard and not manageable.\r\n3. Goes back to scoping configurations and having multiple components leverage `RunLoop`. The current implementation allows that while passing in a `Config` and creating specific ones within constructor would make extensions more hard as you'd have to modify the Config objects passed by different components to account for code evolution within constructor.\r\n4.
