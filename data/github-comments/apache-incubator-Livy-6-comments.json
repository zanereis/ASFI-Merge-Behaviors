So far only batch request is enhanced with delayed flag plus 4 new methods for file uploads. First call (batch create) creates hdfs temp area for uploads and ensures that all files will be deleted after job is finished. Uploads should be definitely separate calls for each file. API could be only single upload method with type parameter but it will completely different from interactive session. I think similar API for batches and interactive sessions is better. Last call is \"start\" - do you know better way how to let Livy know that all files are uploaded and job could be submitted ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/comments/387716781/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/comments/387724865","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-livy/pull/91#issuecomment-387724865","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/91","id":387724865,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NzcyNDg2NQ==","user":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-09T12:39:23Z","updated_at":"2018-05-09T12:39:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I was thinking if we can:\r\n\r\n1. associate file uploading with session creation post request, so that we can handle this in one request, not sure if Http protocol support this.\r\n2.

For better reliability it is better to split upload into separate calls (lack of reconnect support). I don't know how scalatra/livy handle file uploads but very common practice is to load complete file(s) into memory before processing. We can run into memory problems with larger apps.\r\n2. if file is uploaded before session it can hang on hdfs indefinitely without session. Some timeout is possible but such maintenance service looks like basic rest hdfs API.

possibility).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/comments/387746445/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/comments/387798605","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-livy/pull/92#issuecomment-387798605","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/92","id":387798605,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4Nzc5ODYwNQ==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-09T16:33:11Z","updated_at":"2018-05-18T15:07:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#
