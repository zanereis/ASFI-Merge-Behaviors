should provide a simple test for comparing different versions of storm to one another or different hardware options.  The goal is to produce a load at a given throughput and measure the latency it takes the system to process that throughput.  Generally if you have a given SLA you want the same hardware to handle the most throughput possible to meet your SLA.</p>\n\n<p>    The current test uses word count, but should easily be extended to

If an admin has set their own worker.childopts for a given supervisor to say 2GB, we want that to have higher priority over what we calculate.  Similarly if someone sets topology.worker.childopts it needs to have higher priority over the other two. But what if the topology wants to test out the resource aware scheduler on just their topology?  With this they can set topology.worker.childopts to \"-Xmx%HEAP-MEM%m\" and override the hard coded 2GB that was there before.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612608899/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612596126","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4860#issuecomment-2612596126","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4860","id":2612596126,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI1OTYxMjY=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-19T15:57:31Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T13:59:03Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a
