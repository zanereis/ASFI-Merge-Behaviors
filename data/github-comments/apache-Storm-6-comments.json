So, we've been working on the problem for some time and now a solution seems not that perfect but be enough to apply has comed out.</p>\n\n<p>    1.Nimbus Servers now can register themselves in Zookeeper. They perform a leader election using \"InterProcessMutex\" interact with Zookeeper to ensure that there is only one nimbus responsible for launching and monitoring topologies.</p>\n\n<p>    2.Every Nimbus Server is running a timer to compare and find if there are topology codes which are not exists on it's local disk. They would download lcoal missing topology codes from the Nimbus leader through the thrift RPC just like Supervisors do.With this feature, any numbers of Nimbus Server can be launched through out  the cluster.</p>\n\n<p>    3.StormSubmitter,Supervisor,Non-leader Nimbus and Storm UI now are able to find and connect to the Nimbus leader via Zookeeper.A Nimbus leadership table is also added to Storm-UI on the main page to show every Nimbus's leader-election state and it's host in addition.</p>\n\n<p>    PS: Some implementation of the Nimbus-Election part has taken @Frostman's solution for reference(link: <a href=\"https://github.com/nathanmarz/storm/pull/422\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow

There are numerous reasons why a connection can disappear.  Many of them are valid reasons, like a the worker on the other end crashed.  In those cases the goal is to provide a way to recover quickly and continue processing with as little interruption as possible.\n\nIf you have a reproducible use case you can post where the connections are dropped I would be very happy to help debug/fix it.  However, because the connection itself is handled by netty it may be a bug in netty, or possibly something with the network your topology is running on.

As of now the log messages for nimbus and supervisor were seen on command line. Instead of this, its ideal to have log files as in linux. One  show stopper for this is STORM_LOGFILE used in storm.cmd is not same as STORM_LOG_FILE used in storm-config.cmd. i couldn't understand the logic behind \"if not defined STORM_LOG_FILE\" being used in both storm-config.cmd and storm.cmd. </p>\n\n<p>Also, as said STORM_LOGBACK_CONFIGURATION_FILE must point to logback\\cluster.xml. -Dstorm.root.logger doesn't have any significance on command line. All the jar files in storm home directory and storm lib directory must appear in the classpath as in storm.py script.</p>\n\n<p>I ll attach the modified bat files shortly.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612457954/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612458088","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4119#issuecomment-2612458088","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4119","id":2612458088,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI0NTgwODg=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-05T18:51:13Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T12:50:23Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a
