is a nice question - the latency of bookkeeper_client is the latency your application would see, the latency of the per_channel_bookie_client is the latency for individual request sent to a bookie. Typically you will see better latency in bookkeeper_client than latency in per_channel_bookie_client; because bookkeeper uses ack quorum for waiting responses from per_channel_bookie_clients. \r\n\r\nfor example, if you have 3 bookies A, B, C. the latency to A and B are very low - for example, in 2 ms, while C is slow, the latency to C is a bit higher - for example, in 10 ms.\r\n\r\nIf you write an entry (using ack quorum size == 2), the entry will be completed in 2 ms, because A and B can respond in 2ms.
