And there are some places where Kylin is not compatible with Mac os X (it does not check the os type), it caused some errors, such as [KYLIN-3756](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN-3756) and [KYLIN-3757](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN-3757). This util method provides a general function to verify whether the current os type is Mac os X or not.\r\n\r\nBy providing this function, we can do generic checking for the different `like-UNIX` os, and fix those compatible issues existing in the shell script.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/comments/473759267/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/comments/473760058","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kylin/pull/526#issuecomment-473760058","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/526","id":473760058,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3Mzc2MDA1OA==","user":{"login":"asfgit","id":1341245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDEyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1341245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit","html_url":"https://github.com/asfgit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-18T03:45:41Z","updated_at":"2019-03-18T03:45:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Can
