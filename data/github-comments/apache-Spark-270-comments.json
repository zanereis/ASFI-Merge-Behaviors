We had some transformers implemented under `mllib.feature`, similar to sk-learn's approach. For feature selection, we can follow the same approach if we view feature selection as transformation: 1) fit a dataset and select a subset of features, 2) transform a dataset by picking out selected features. So for the API, I suggest the following\n\n```\nclass ChiSquaredFeatureSelector(numFeatures: Int) extends Serializable {\n  def fit(dataset: RDD[LabeledPoint]): this.type\n  def transform(dataset: RDD[LabeledPoint]): RDD[LabeledPoint]\n} \n```\n\nand we can hide the implementation from public interfaces.

Do I understand correct, that you propose that `fit(dataset: RDD[LabeledPoint])` should compute feature scores according to the feature selection algorithm and `transform(dataset: RDD[LabeledPoint])` should return the filtered dataset?\n2.  It seems that such an interface allows misuse when someone calls `transform` before `fit`. In some sense it is similar to calling `predict` before actually learning the model. This is avoided in MLLib classification models implementation by means of `ClassificationModel` interface that has `predict` only. Individual classifier has object that returns its instance (that does training as well). I like this approach more because it is less error-prone from user prospective, but it is a little bit implicit from developer's prospective (you need to know that you need to implement a fabric). Long story short, why not to seal `fit` inside the constructor or inside the object?\n\n```\ntrait FeatureSelector extends Serializable {\n   def transform(dataset: RDD[LabeledPoint]):

I don't remember why this code was added (or whether it's actually correct, since it seems to assume that files are downloaded into the current working directory), but I'm not sure that `fetchCachedFile` will properly handle that case; it seems like it would only copy the `.tar.gz` file without decompressing it in the executor's directory.\n\nWe could try to special-case fix this by moving the decompression logic into `fetchCachedFile`, but I'm worried that it will make `fetchFile` even harder to understand.  I think that `fetchFile` might be due for a refactoring.\n\nAlso, do you think we should just replace `fetchFile` with `fetchCachedFile` and keep the uncached version private?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51085554/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51085913","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1702#issuecomment-51085913","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1702","id":51085913,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMDg1OTEz","user":{"login":"pwendell","id":320616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDYxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/320616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell","html_url":"https://github.com/pwendell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-04T16:51:25Z","updated_at":"2014-08-04T16:51:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Jenkins, test this please.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51085913/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51086273","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1702#issuecomment-51086273","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1702","id":51086273,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMDg2Mjcz","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-04T16:54:12Z","updated_at":"2014-08-04T16:54:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA tests have started for PR 1702.

(Correct me if I'm understanding your proposal incorrectly; I am basing this off @liancheng's pseudocode in an earlier comment.) Here I am assuming that `--arg1` and `--arg2` are also spark-submit arguments:\n\n```\nbin/spark-submit --jars app.jar --arg1 -- --arg2\n```\n\nHere we treat `--arg1` as a spark-submit argument, but pass `--arg2` to the application. The user may also specify the primary jar explicitly as follows:\n\n```\nbin/spark-submit app.jar --arg1 -- --arg2\n```\n\nHere we treat both `--arg1` and `--arg2` as spark-submit arguments, but we may pass `--` to the application depending on what `--arg1` is. For instance, if `--arg1` is `--name` and takes in a value, then `--` will become the app name. Otherwise, if `--arg1` is `--supervise`, which does not take in a value, then `--` will be passed to the application.\n\nFrom the user's perspective, the ways we specify the primary resource in these two commands are near equivalent. However, the arguments are actually parsed very differently. On the other hand, if we simply add a new Spark specific config (`--spark-application-args` or something) and keep the way we specify the primary resource the same, we get backwards compatibility for free while providing this new functionality. This latter approach just seems simpler to me.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51093637/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51095112","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1313#issuecomment-51095112","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1313","id":51095112,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMDk1MTEy","user":{"login":"mateiz","id":228859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODg1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz","html_url":"https://github.com/mateiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-04T18:04:39Z","updated_at":"2014-08-04T18:04:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I see, got it.
