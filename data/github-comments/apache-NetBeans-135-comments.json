I have a feeling that the XDG spec says a 48x48 icon is the minimum that must be provided if installing as icons, hence the DEB provides that plus SVG.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1296319911/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1296321061","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/4868#issuecomment-1296321061","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4868","id":1296321061,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5NREol","user":{"login":"timboudreau","id":1901175,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDExNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1901175?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timboudreau","html_url":"https://github.com/timboudreau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timboudreau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timboudreau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timboudreau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timboudreau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timboudreau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timboudreau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timboudreau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timboudreau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timboudreau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-30T18:25:59Z","updated_at":"2022-10-30T18:25:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> would you be interested in becoming a NetBeans committer?\r\n\r\nI spent nearly 20 years of my life being **Mr. NetBeans**, so I pretty intentionally did *not* sign up to be one when things moved to Apache.\r\n\r\nBut yeah, I supposed I could be talked into it.\r\n\r\nRe the patch, it would sure be nice for it to be integrated into the next release.

(You can still associate your individual projects with Java 8 if desired.)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1296510552/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1296768530","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/4856#issuecomment-1296768530","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4856","id":1296768530,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5NSx4S","user":{"login":"MartinBalin","id":26064232,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDY0MjMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26064232?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBalin","html_url":"https://github.com/MartinBalin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBalin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBalin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBalin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBalin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBalin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBalin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBalin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBalin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBalin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-31T08:39:49Z","updated_at":"2022-10-31T08:41:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"In VSCode it is problematic as UI is very limited, nothing like Options dialog in NetBeans.

That information looks interesting.\r\n\r\nBesides that, I knew that years ago I had read about this same issue somewhere, but I didn't remember exactly where. I've made a quick search and I think that I've found such bug report: [Bug 236431 - action items does not show hints and warnings ](https://bz.apache.org/netbeans/show_bug.cgi?id=236431). This dates back to NetBeans 7.4.\r\n\r\nAccording to that thread, Geertjan Wielenga wrote an article about that topic in the Oracle blog. Here there is a copy taken from the Internet Archive: [Towards a Centralized Dashboard for Coding Problems](https://web.archive.org/web/20170313122328/https://blogs.oracle.com/geertjan/entry/towards_a_centralized_dashboard_for).\r\n\r\nI see 2 important points in it:\r\n\r\n* The *Action items* window was originally the *Task list* window. So it seems that it was repurposed later to do more things. That may explain its peculiar behavior.\r\n\r\n* Jan Lahoda wrote a plug-in that showed **all warnings** in the *Action items* window. I don't know if it was just for the current file or for the whole project. But such plug-in seems to have vanished. I've checked the [Lahoda's GitHub profile](https://github.com/lahodaj) but I've not had any luck. **I guess that plug-in might be the key to know what is needed.**\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, it would be enough if NetBeans IDE were able to show the warnings of the current file. If we need a detailed analysis of the whole project, we can always run *Source → Inspect...*\r\n\r\nIndeed, I think that's the way the *Problems* panel of IntelliJ works nowadays:\r\n\r\n* For the current file: shows errors and warnings.\r\n* For the whole project: shows errors only. Do you want warnings? Run an inspection.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1297354885/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1297361631","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/3725#issuecomment-1297361631","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/3725","id":1297361631,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5NVCrf","user":{"login":"hmlnarik","id":5391360,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzOTEzNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5391360?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmlnarik","html_url":"https://github.com/hmlnarik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmlnarik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmlnarik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmlnarik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmlnarik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmlnarik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmlnarik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmlnarik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmlnarik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmlnarik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-31T16:35:40Z","updated_at":"2022-10-31T16:35:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I got the same error with Usage search when loading Keycloak project.

I'll look into it.\r\n\r\nHere's what I found. The NetBeans build avoids the connection limit of `mod_limitipconn` by not sending any request headers at all. That module hooks in too late in the request processing phase to enforce its limit on such unused, idle connections. Looking at the source code:\r\n\r\n* the earliest hook for `mod_reqtimeout` is `ap_hook_process_connection`, called during connection processing, while\r\n* the earliest hook for `mod_limitipconn` is `ap_hook_quick_handler`, called later during request processing when the request headers are read and parsed.\r\n\r\nMy experiments confirm this. I can make 100 connections to `netbeans.osuosl.org` through the proxy server, perform the TLS handshake, and as long as no request headers are sent, they'll just sit there for 20 seconds until they are closed by `mod_reqtimeout`. If, on the other hand, I make 40 connections and send the request headers immediately, only 8 of them are successful. The other 32 return \"503 Service Unavailable\" due to the per-IP connection limit of `mod_limitipconn`.\r\n\r\nThere's an experimental [`mod_noloris`](https://github.com/apache/httpd/blob/trunk/modules/experimental/mod_noloris.c) from Apache that looks interesting and appears to enforce the per-IP connection limit earlier.
