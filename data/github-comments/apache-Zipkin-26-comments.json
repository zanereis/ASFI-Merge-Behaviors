But it might be safer - if we remove a module from package.json, it won't be removed from node_modules automatically, so I guess caching ~/.npm might be the best idea in that regard.\n\n>  @eirslett how do you feel about npm shrinkwrap?\n\nIt's a natural next step to think of. Build stability is key!\nBut I can make another pull request with shrinkwrap later on, so this one doesn't get too big?\n\n> Adding npm test to the zipkin-web:check also sounds like a great idea to me; maybe it'll encourage front-end tests in the future. \n\nYes! We should have browser tests. I think using karma/phantomjs is a good fit, since it has good webpack support. Again, I'd want to put that in a separate PR.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/181768767/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/181769422","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/943#issuecomment-181769422","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/943","id":181769422,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MTc2OTQyMg==","user":{"login":"eirslett","id":1872593,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NzI1OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1872593?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett","html_url":"https://github.com/eirslett","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-09T09:03:48Z","updated_at":"2016-02-09T09:03:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> right now, running tests doesn't actually invoke node, so a failure would wait until post merge. maybe we can do something to make node do things eagerly on pull request?\n\nMaybe Travis should run the whole build process instead of just the tests?

If a client emitted cs/cr, their difference defines the duration and no clock skew should be able to affect it. If the server logged a pair of sr/ss, then their difference should never be larger than the client side duration, independent of clock skew, as otherwise it breaks causality. The only scenario where server span can be longer than client span is in fire and forget cases, which arguably should not be modeled with client and server sharing the span ID.\n\nSo unless I am missing a use case, it seems perfectly valid for collectors to precompute duration based on annotations (ideally from the same host), and clock skew adjuster should never need to change that duration.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/182462943/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/182549529","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/953#issuecomment-182549529","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/953","id":182549529,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MjU0OTUyOQ==","user":{"login":"abesto","id":59982,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5OTgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59982?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abesto","html_url":"https://github.com/abesto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abesto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abesto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abesto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abesto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abesto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abesto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abesto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abesto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abesto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-10T19:50:26Z","updated_at":"2016-02-10T19:51:07Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Learning nr. 1: `zipkin-web/src/main/resources/dist` is not removed by `zipkin-web:clean`.
