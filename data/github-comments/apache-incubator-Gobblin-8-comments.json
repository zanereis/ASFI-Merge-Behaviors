the current code base, its a little weird to have a class extend `Instrumented` and to get it registered in `GobblinMetricsRegistry`. When one extends `Instrumented`, the super constructor invokes `getMetricContext` which creates a `MetricContext` properly. However, the `MetricContext` is not registered in `GobblinMetricsRegistry`. In order to get it registered, I tried to create a `GobblinMetrics` instance using the `GobblinMetrics.get()` method (which automatically registers the newly made `MetricContext` in `GobblinMetricsRegistry`). However the `get()` method requires a `parentContext` be specified. This is where the problem arises, the `Instrumented` constructor has already made a `metricContext` that is a child of `TaskMetrics`, and now `GobblinMetrics` requires a `parentContext` to be specified.\n\nSo instead I solely use `GobblinMetrics`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/132344546/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/132344999","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/294#issuecomment-132344999","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/294","id":132344999,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMjM0NDk5OQ==","user":{"login":"sahilTakiar","id":1282583,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODI1ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1282583?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar","html_url":"https://github.com/sahilTakiar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-18T20:43:36Z","updated_at":"2015-08-18T20:43:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ibuenros can you take another look?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/132344999/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/132372341","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/294#issuecomment-132372341","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/294","id":132372341,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMjM3MjM0MQ==","user":{"login":"ibuenros","id":1364112,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQxMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1364112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros","html_url":"https://github.com/ibuenros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-18T22:16:51Z","updated_at":"2015-08-18T22:16:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It looks good.
