@sijie,\r\n\r\nI'm currently using Eclipse to develop for Pulsar. What IDE do you use for Pulsar? \r\nOn a side note, do you know how to get the .class file for a .java file like ServiceConfiguration and import it into an IDE? Without it, the Getter() and Setter() methods that are lombok generated is not recognized by the IDE (for me, Eclipse) as methods which exist (so they are considered illegal syntax).

We restarted some bookies and every broker and the problem persisted but some minutes later the problem was solved.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1980715/52353590-a2748f00-2a0d-11e9-9648-d17cb50710cb.png)\r\nAs you can see in the above image, at around 14:00 started the high cpu in that bookie, we restarted it at around 14:20 and a few minutes later the cpu was high again but this time the bookie has few or none read/write activity.\r\n\r\nWe believe we hit this bug: https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/pull/1620\r\nSo we are planning to update to the last stable version (4.7.3).\r\n\r\nAs you can see in internal stats, subscription `f6f49168781f402c99ddfa871bc0e90c-fury-news-sender-ios-meli.notifications-providers` had some weird values:\r\n```\r\n      \"messagesConsumedCounter\" : -116637,\r\n      \"cursorLedger\" : -1,\r\n      \"cursorLedgerLastEntry\" : -1,\r\n      \"state\" : \"NoLedger\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs that cursor's state expected?\r\n\r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/461082870/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/461103147","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/3530#issuecomment-461103147","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/3530","id":461103147,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MTEwMzE0Nw==","user":{"login":"merlimat","id":62500,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat","html_url":"https://github.com/merlimat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-06T17:05:38Z","updated_at":"2019-02-06T17:05:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"run

another fault on me :disappointed:, it sound pretty obvious now!, next time feel free to assign any issue :+1: \r\n\r\njust one question, wouldn't be possible to use `ConcurrentHashMap<SomeIdentifier, Consumer|Producer>` ? are we using somewhere `==` operator for comparing keys?

Therefore, to avoid making sure that `equals` and `hashCode` return different values, we went with identity map, since we never do lookup by name anyway, just either iterating over the objects or removing a particular object.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/461545359/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/461547078","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/3513#issuecomment-461547078","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/3513","id":461547078,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MTU0NzA3OA==","user":{"login":"merlimat","id":62500,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat","html_url":"https://github.com/merlimat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-07T18:41:01Z","updated_at":"2019-02-07T18:41:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"rerun
