explanation of the _GPU Overhead_ graph:\n\n**Alloc** and **Dealloc** are times spent in calls made to `cudaMalloc` and `cudaFree`.\n**ToDev** and **FromDev** are times spent in memory transfer to the device and from the device respectively.\n**Conversion** is the time spent in converting dense to sparse, or sparse to dense format in host or device memory.\n\nThe point of having the Garbage Collection graph is to show that it was insignificant compared to the time spent in matrix multiplication.\n\nSome points are missing in the \"GPU\" lines.

In other words, what are the use-cases of exposing SystemML datastructures to the not-so-advanced user?` (see https://github.com/apache/incubator-systemml/pull/204):\n\nWe stick with `start ... eval` construct for now as it has simplest logic and focus on the design of built-in functions (i.e. to make `full` API compatible with NumPy). When we are relatively happy with the design, we push this PR in as WIP and mention in our doc that `start ... eval` will be removed in future. The advanced push-down logic and lazy data structures will be implemented in Scala DSL. Once this DSL is part of master, we replace [addPyDMLStmt and related functions](https://github.com/apache/incubator-systemml/pull/197/files#diff-2c4346a06f8454b330603d8a0dee33b7R37) with calls to Scala lazy structures.

All the other models (including LogisticRegression) inherit their implementation from BaseSystemMLEstimator. So, the focus should be on design of BaseSystemMLEstimator. If we are comfortable with that, it doesn't matter whether the implemented ML model is LogisticRegression or NaiveBayes or any other.\n2. Due to overdesigning the initial implementation, very little progress has been made. As a side note, java LogisticRegression API has been there for almost a year and no model has been added since then (java or python).\n3. The hope of this API is to increase adoption at least in algorithm front. As a first step towards that, we need to update the Algorithm documentation with interesting examples that motivates people to try SystemML. Adding just one algorithm (without strong reason) seems to defeat the purpose of that.\n\nPlease note: the API is WIP, so you are welcome to modify the added ML models or add new ML models once this PR is in :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/238354619/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/238375792","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/200#issuecomment-238375792","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/200","id":238375792,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzODM3NTc5Mg==","user":{"login":"deroneriksson","id":12634533,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjM0NTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12634533?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson","html_url":"https://github.com/deroneriksson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-08T21:00:41Z","updated_at":"2016-08-08T21:00:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@niketanpansare @mboehm7 Is this ready to be merged into staging directory?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/238375792/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/238378021","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/200#issuecomment-238378021","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/200","id":238378021,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzODM3ODAyMQ==","user":{"login":"iyounus","id":8313847,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMTM4NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8313847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iyounus","html_url":"https://github.com/iyounus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iyounus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iyounus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iyounus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iyounus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iyounus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iyounus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iyounus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iyounus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iyounus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-08T21:08:35Z","updated_at":"2016-08-08T21:08:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@deroneriksson I'm updating the gradient descent algorithm.

But, notice that transfer time is very huge which is particularly because of transferring data to and fro GPU to execute instructions like r', +, +*, etc. I believe, once all such instructions are implemented for GPU, we can expect speedup of around 10x to 12x.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/238428560/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/238602674","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/206#issuecomment-238602674","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/206","id":238602674,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzODYwMjY3NA==","user":{"login":"niketanpansare","id":11686380,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjg2Mzgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11686380?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare","html_url":"https://github.com/niketanpansare","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-09T16:06:48Z","updated_at":"2016-08-09T16:06:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks Tanuj.

Tried this out the example on Python 3.\n   - Can you update the example in the initial post to reflect the recent update, as in:\n     \n     ```\n     sums = \"\"\"\n     s1 = sum(m1)\n     s2 = sum(m2)\n     s3 = 'whatever'\n     \"\"\"\n     ml = MLContext(sc)\n     rdd1 = sc.parallelize([\"1.0,2.0\", \"3.0,4.0\"])\n     rdd2 = sc.parallelize([\"5.0,6.0\", \"7.0,8.0\"])\n     dml = Dml(sums).input(m1=rdd1).input(m2=rdd2).out(\"s1\", \"s2\", \"s3\")\n     ml.execute(dml).get(\"s1\", \"s2\", \"s3\")\n     [10.0, 26.0, \"whatever\"]\n     ```\n2. Ran the Python tests with `spark-submit` (after adding the missing comma).\n   - I used `PYSPARK_PYTHON=python3 spark-submit --master local[*] --driver-class-path $SYSTEMML_HOME/target/SystemML.jar --py-files=$SYSTEMML_HOME/python/SystemML.py $SYSTEMML_HOME/python/SystemMLtests.py`\n3. Tried to alter the script so that `s2` would return a matrix, i.e. `s2 = m1 * 3`.\n   - Right now, this just returns a `Java object` reflecting a `mlcontext.Matrix` type that was added (  @deroneriksson correct if this is wrong).  We should add a `Matrix` type to our Python API here, and then add some logic to convert this to a DataFrame, RDD, etc. as is done on the Java/Scala side.  Should just be another simple wrapper over [1].\n\nSome other thoughts:\n1. Can you move the files from `python/` to `src/main/python` just for consistency with the Java and Scala code?  I know Spark has a `python/` folder, but they also have the project split into multiple modules, so they have to consolidate the Python code into a single top-level `python/` folder to allow for imports to work properly.  We only have one single module, so that won't be a problem.\n2. In a follow-up PR, could you look into adding a `setup.py` file and any other requirements so that we could create a `pip` package?  Then we could allow for `pip` installs directly from the git repo, using a subdirectory flag pointing to `src/main/python` [2].\n\n[1]: http://apache.github.io/incubator-systemml/spark-mlcontext-programming-guide#matrix-output\n[2]: http://stackoverflow.com/a/36074026\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/241118588/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
