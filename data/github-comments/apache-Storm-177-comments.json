Also we can build a command line tool over rest API, if needed.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=kishorvpatil\" class=\"user-hover\" rel=\"kishorvpatil\">Kishor Patil</a> The disadvantage I see is that it is very important to clear an action in zookeeper so that it is not executed again. However such scenarios can be identified and fixed. My primary concern is the asynchronous nature of call and viewing the output through a file dump. If I submit a request such as jstack, jmap on UI, I as a user expect an immediate output on the web page itself. If logviewer consumes these requests, it can serve the request synchronously without storing in a file. Additionally there is no mechanism of cleaning up file dumps and for a user it is difficult to know which dump corresponds to his jstack request. By serving the output directly on page solves that problem.</p>\n\n<p>If multiple users are submitting heap dump requests, we can chose to do that in different threads. <br/>\nOther concerns coming out in doing it synchronously through logviewer<br/>\n1. pid discovery - logviewer has access to same configuration as supervisor. Supervisor reads worker-artifcats directory to read the pid. Logviewer can do the same as long as it knows the worker-id<br/>\n2. profiler actions - It is inherently asynchronous in nature. We can move away from time-bound stop to manual stop. User can start the profiler and manually stop the profiler (similar to debug/stop-debug we have for topologies). <br/>\nWhat do you think?

Whatever conversion logic was common across multiple files, remain in local_state_converter.clj.<br/>\n    2. Conversion logic exclusively used in a clj is moved to that clj e.g. ls-local-assignments conversion has been moved to supervisor.clj. This will make it easy to port individual clojure files.<br/>\n    3.

We may also disallow operations if user is not same as which topology process is running with. I will first start with jstack, heap and restart worker command. These also happen to be the utilities which are enabled by default. For moving profiler, I will file a separate JIRA. I am fine with executing profiler through the existing flow. </p>\n\n<p>Also currently the profile-action is not removed if the command exit code is non-zero. I will remove that condition so that supervisor doesn't repeat a command forever. </p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612871149/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612644769","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/5069#issuecomment-2612644769","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/5069","id":2612644769,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI2NDQ3Njk=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-18T09:04:33Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T14:20:17Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=githubbot\">githubbot</a>:</i>\n<p>Github user abhishekagarwal87 commented on a diff in the pull request:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1108#discussion_r53286948\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1108#discussion_r53286948</a></p>\n\n<p>    &#8212; Diff: storm-core/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/scheduler/DefaultScheduler.java &#8212;<br/>\n    @@ -0,0 +1,111 @@<br/>\n    +/**<br/>\n    + * Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one<br/>\n    + * or more contributor license agreements.
