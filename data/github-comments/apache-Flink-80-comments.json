I added a few comment for checks to add in line.\n\nThanks, Fabian\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/169700059/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/169703047","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1487#issuecomment-169703047","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1487","id":169703047,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2OTcwMzA0Nw==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-07T15:49:44Z","updated_at":"2016-01-07T15:49:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the fast update!

@danielblazevski, I'm sorry for late reply. If you turn off IntelliJ IDEA align option (Turn off Preferences -> Editor -> Code Style -> Scala -> Wrapping and Braces -> Method declaration parameters -> Align when multiline), you can get style that is suggested by @tillrohrmann.\n\nCould you apply this option?\n\nI think that your PR is almost ready to merge. But I have to check few problems that still exist.\n\nFirst, about a meaning of `UseQuadTree` parameter, you said that it means force-use quadtree. I think this would be a problem because `DistanceMeasure` parameter can be conflict with quadtree. I would like to raise an error earlier if the parameter setting has a problem. Could you add this into top of fit operation?\n\nSecond, how about avoiding `cross` operation? As @tillrohrmann said, `cross` operation is a very heavy operation. Is there any nicer solution to this?\n\nOther problems such as some difference styles, unnecessary spaces can be addressed by me before merge this. :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/170875879/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/170877495","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/730#issuecomment-170877495","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/730","id":170877495,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MDg3NzQ5NQ==","user":{"login":"chiwanpark","id":1941681,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDE2ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1941681?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark","html_url":"https://github.com/chiwanpark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-12T11:05:53Z","updated_at":"2016-01-12T11:06:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Is there any update?
