I think it would be interesting to look into it. There may be a couple of pull request with bad results in Travis based on Travis internal problems. Similar observations  with Appveyor - is it really useful to run both ?

Then, there is another library for .NET Core which to be honest is completely useless as it downloads so many dependencies that it's impossible to use in any web project as they quickly become conflicting. Ideally there must be just one single .NET project which cross-compiles to both .NET classic and .NET Standard. There is no need for .NET Core as .NET Standard covers it (is it maybe coming from misunderstanding of library creators in differences between .net core and .net standard?).\r\n\r\nAll I'm adding is a new project referencing all existing files. The project simply excludes stuff which is not covered by least common denominator of .NET Standard 1.4, 1.6 and .NET 4.5, but allows you to use Thrift on any device. This can be carefully extended further to support all Thrift features. however it's more complicated with .NET Standard as unlike .NET it doesn't have all socketing, networking etc. built in and needs external references.\r\n\r\nI would suggest though having 1 main package with core functionality as I just did, and adding more libraries which implement specific features (sockets, web http etc.) as they require specific dependencies.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/328942837/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/328943377","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/1355#issuecomment-328943377","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/1355","id":328943377,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyODk0MzM3Nw==","user":{"login":"aloneguid","id":3155189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTUxODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3155189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloneguid","html_url":"https://github.com/aloneguid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloneguid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloneguid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloneguid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloneguid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloneguid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloneguid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloneguid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloneguid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloneguid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-12T18:36:33Z","updated_at":"2017-09-12T18:36:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@gideonkorir from what I can see .net core lib was created in times when .net core was in early stages, has some classes renamed and doesn't align with existing csharp project.
