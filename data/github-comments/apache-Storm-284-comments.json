Passing offset lag by metrics seems like it has a bunch of roadblocks and bad side effects to me, so it doesn't seem like a good option to me anymore. Adding support for Pattern subscriptions and maybe adding a Windows script to call storm-kafka-monitor feels like band aid fixing to me. I think it's probably our best option at the moment though.</p>\n\n<p>Kafka seems to be implementing an AdminClient that is supposed to be backwards compatible for more than 1 release <a href=\"https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-117%3A+Add+a+public+AdminClient+API+for+Kafka+admin+operations\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-117%3A+Add+a+public+AdminClient+API+for+Kafka+admin+operations</a>. I think if that client is updated to include consumer group operations, we can just use it directly in Storm UI and solve these problems. It reads to me like the plan is for that client to support a lot of the same functionality as the included Kafka shell scripts. The current kafka-consumer-groups.sh included with a Kafka install already shows lag for every topic a group is subscribed to, so we might not have to pass along more than the bootstrap servers and consumer group to Storm UI.. </p>\n\n<p>I'm happy to wait a bit to see where the AdminClient goes before trying to come up with a more solid solution here.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2613020002/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/312129438","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2155#issuecomment-312129438","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2155","id":312129438,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMjEyOTQzOA==","user":{"login":"hmcl","id":10284328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjg0MzI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10284328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl","html_url":"https://github.com/hmcl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-29T22:51:08Z","updated_at":"2017-06-29T23:00:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@srdo I agree with you concerning this [comment](https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2155#issuecomment-311751331). There is really not a much better way to do this. I agree with your comment \"move the FirstPollOffsetStrategy default into a static field in KafkaSpoutConfig like the rest for consistency\" - let's do it.\r\n\r\nI think that what confused me is the way the whole class is organized. For instance, the state of KafkaSpoutConfig is not at the top of the class as one would expect. Perhaps we should follow the usual convention and move the [constructor and fields](https://github.com/srdo/storm/blob/142d1f8e2609d1a48b6be71084987fe8cdc46a3f/external/storm-kafka-client/src/main/java/org/apache/storm/kafka/spout/KafkaSpoutConfig.java#L302-#L331) to the top, after the constants, then put the static inner classes ([here](https://github.com/srdo/storm/blob/142d1f8e2609d1a48b6be71084987fe8cdc46a3f/external/storm-kafka-client/src/main/java/org/apache/storm/kafka/spout/KafkaSpoutConfig.java#L59-#L79) and [here](https://github.com/srdo/storm/blob/142d1f8e2609d1a48b6be71084987fe8cdc46a3f/external/storm-kafka-client/src/main/java/org/apache/storm/kafka/spout/KafkaSpoutConfig.java#L125-#L300)), then the [factory methods](https://github.com/srdo/storm/blob/142d1f8e2609d1a48b6be71084987fe8cdc46a3f/external/storm-kafka-client/src/main/java/org/apache/storm/kafka/spout/KafkaSpoutConfig.java#L81-#L123), and at last all the [accessor methods](https://github.com/srdo/storm/blob/142d1f8e2609d1a48b6be71084987fe8cdc46a3f/external/storm-kafka-client/src/main/java/org/apache/storm/kafka/spout/KafkaSpoutConfig.java#L333-#L398).\r\n\r\nOn a different note, I noticed that this PR now has the changes from the [STORM-2541 PR](https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2150) included in its single commit. I think that this PR should have only one commit, with the refactoring of KafkaSpoutConfig. The [STORM-2541 PR](https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2150) should have two commits, this PR's commit, and its own commit. At last the [STORM-2542 PR](https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2151) should have three commits, this PR's commit, [STORM-2541 PR](https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2150) commit, and its own commit.\r\n\r\nThat would make it easy to merge and the same time not loose Git history.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/312129438/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/312131447","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2150#issuecomment-312131447","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2150","id":312131447,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMjEzMTQ0Nw==","user":{"login":"hmcl","id":10284328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjg0MzI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10284328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl","html_url":"https://github.com/hmcl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-29T23:04:46Z","updated_at":"2017-06-29T23:04:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@srdo I am +1 on this PR.

This looks a lot like how the subscribe API behaves when there are multiple KafkaConsumers in a thread, as described here <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-2514?focusedCommentId=16014195&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-16014195\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-2514?focusedCommentId=16014195&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-16014195</a>. I'm not really sure why the rebalance takes 3.5 minutes, since I would expect it to take 2.5 (the session timeout). In the linked demo code, the long rebalance happens because rebalancing can't finish until all the KafkaConsumers call (and block in) poll, which can't happen if there are multiple consumers in a thread. The rebalance times out at the session timeout.</p>\n\n<p>Was the number of executors lower than the number of tasks when you had this problem <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=EitZei\" class=\"user-hover\" rel=\"EitZei\">Antti JÃ¤rvinen</a>?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-2542\" title=\"Deprecate storm-kafka-client KafkaConsumer.subscribe API subscriptions on 1.x and remove them as options in 2.x\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-2542\"><del>STORM-2542</del></a> gets rid of long rebalances, so it should be fixed in any case even if it's not the issue where the task count isn't equal to the executor number.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612995008/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612679593","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/5177#issuecomment-2612679593","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/5177","id":2612679593,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI2Nzk1OTM=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-01T21:33:04Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T14:35:59Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=erikdw\">erikdw</a>:</i>\n<p>I inquired with the Mesos user list about whether they might have a feature to allow the \"3rd possible solution\" in the Description: i.e., allowing Storm-on-Mesos to ensure there is a logviewer deployed to every host where Storm Workers+Supervisors run:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.mail-archive.com/user@mesos.apache.org/msg09141.html\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://www.mail-archive.com/user@mesos.apache.org/msg09141.html</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p><b>Answer</b>:  there isn't support for this kind of feature yet, but the Mesosphere folks that work on DC/OS also have need of such a feature, so there likely will be a feature eventually:</p>\n\n<div class=\"panel\" style=\"border-width: 1px;\"><div class=\"panelHeader\" style=\"border-bottom-width: 1px;\"><b>Kevin Klues talking about \"daemon sets\" and \"admin tasks\"</b></div><div class=\"panelContent\">\n<p>What you are describing is a feature we call 'admin tasks' or 'daemon sets'. </p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, there is no direct support for these yet, but we do have plans in the (relatively) near future to start working on it.</p>\n\n<p>One of our use cases is exactly what you describe with the logging service.

When the worker is killed, the KafkaConsumer doesn't get a chance to disconnect cleanly from Kafka, so Kafka will wait for the full session timeout before it declares the missing consumer dead and finishes rebalancing.

unfortunately we're busy with handling our own works as well, whether it is related to Storm project or not. I understand the pain when review process is dragging as I was a one of contributor for more than a year, but please take into account the fact that the review process for PR could be dragging even for months, which I really would like to avoid, but we can't keep up every time.\r\n\r\nYou may want to take a look at other pull requests in Storm project, or other OSPs to see how others leave comments for kindly reminder.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/313282841/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2613020208","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/6384#issuecomment-2613020208","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/6384","id":2613020208,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTMwMjAyMDg=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-06T03:36:11Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T17:15:09Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a
