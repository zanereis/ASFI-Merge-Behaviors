I havenâ€™t checked  every test carefully, but this error is a must in the okhttp test ,  postgresql scenario test, rabbitmq-scenario, etc.\r\nYean, this does not affect the results of ci, so  ci  is successful. But it will cause the running log to be unable to be seen when running. It will bring some trouble to code debugging. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/833631065/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/833668736","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/6903#issuecomment-833668736","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/6903","id":833668736,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzMzY2ODczNg==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-06T16:33:04Z","updated_at":"2021-05-06T16:33:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@dmsolr Please recheck the running logs.

activated. So v2 APIs should be an option and enhanced version of v1. That is why I said, v1 may not be removed ever. Even with a tiny extra load(one more object created and GC), V2 is slower(very little) than V1, purely from intercepting perspective. \r\nBut when we use it in the right place, to provide more context for `afterMethod` and make RunningContext easier and less to use, we could have a better performance from agent + plugin perspective, which is end user's real feeling.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/835369881/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/835375699","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/6745#issuecomment-835375699","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/6745","id":835375699,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzNTM3NTY5OQ==","user":{"login":"kezhenxu94","id":15965696,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTY1Njk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15965696?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94","html_url":"https://github.com/kezhenxu94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-08T14:01:29Z","updated_at":"2021-05-08T14:01:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Early
