Great to hear!  That was an embarassing goof.\r\n2. solr zk -help is no longer valid with our move to using the patterns -h and --help.  The docs in branch_9x should be updated (from another PR), so it's okay it doesn't work as long as --help does work! \r\n3. your suggestion was a good one, I hadn't thought about that idea, so really glad we collaborated on it!\r\n4. okay, I was able to run it locally, not sure what is going on.  So, I think this is a place where the `bin/solr` and the `bin/solr.cmd` have diveraged, and we need to update `bin/solr.cmd`.   Would you be willing to dig into `bin/solr.cmd` and make sure that both `-cloud` and `--cloud` work to start in SolrCloud mode?   That way we still have backwards compatibility in the 9x line for the `-cloud`, and then in 10x, we will only support `--cloud`.\r\n5. woot!\r\n6. Similar to 4, I think we need to update `bin/solr.cmd` to pass the arguments through properly.  I believe the error message is because in the tool, we look up an `arg` and it doesn't exist.  For example, for the ZkRmTool, see the change on https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2593/files#diff-52ad5182929dc04b5f95c07e284695685a40d56b62899512632459e0137ac086, I think we need something in `bin/solr.cmd`!   The bats test suggest that the code works properly between `bin/solr` and the java code, so that is why I think `bin/solr.cmd` needs some love!\r\n\r\nFeel free to push to this repo, you *may* have to open a PR against my repo.   Also a patch file is welcome.

The biggest downside in the code for me is how boilerplate heavy it is.  There are Component interfaces, which have Component implementations, which then reference Models, which come from Stores, which fetch the data via API calls.  Those abstractions all make sense individually.  But they're the main reason probably that this turned into an 8k line PR!\r\n\r\nYou are right. There are multiple layers that abstract API, logic and UI from each other, resulting in a lot of boilerplate code. The repetitiveness is also a side-effect of applying the same patterns to all componets.\r\n\r\nBesides the drawback of the quantity in changes, there are two main benefits that may be achieved with that approach: testing components / individual parts becomes much easier, and new developers have an easier start because they can follow the structure and patterns from other components when they are working on a new component.\r\n\r\nI wanted to write some tests for completion, but I had to postpone it for the time being.\r\n\r\n>    Positing community consensus on taking this forward, I think we'll need to break this into smaller pieces that are less intimidating to folks.  I suspect you've already thought a bit about where to draw some of those lines, but I have at least some hunches we could talk over at some point. (Split \"Java Properties\" and \"logging\" pages into different PRs, slim the theme down to only support a single mode, commit the theme separately, etc.)\r\n\r\nYou are completely right on that. It is possible, and this was the plan once we work on the Jira part of the migration, to split the components into separate PRs and tickets. This would allow in the long run an easier integration of new components. Contributors will also have to worry only about a single component and not the entire application when working on a ticket, PR, feature or bugfix.\r\n\r\nThe POC includes already two of the components for demonstration, so that it covers almost all parts of the Compose app (including navigation) that are crucial to get started. The only thing I can recall at the moment and that is missing is probably the explicit error handling, but that is something I have already worked on in other projects and shouldn't be a problem integrating.\r\n\r\n> I've left a few comments inline.\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your time reviewing this. As you noticed, this POC still needs some work and cleanup before moving forward.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2274591704/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2274878399","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2619#issuecomment-2274878399","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2619","id":2274878399,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6Hl-O_","user":{"login":"dsmiley","id":377295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzI5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/377295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley","html_url":"https://github.com/dsmiley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-08T03:23:09Z","updated_at":"2024-08-08T03:23:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Are we good with the CHANGES.txt and other changes?

got it to run!   `http://localhost:8983/solr/compose`!    So, it might be a bit of bike shedding, but I wonder if it should just be called `ui`?   Just to distingush it from `admin`?  Or maybe just refer to it as `compose` everywhere, instead of `compose-ui`?   \r\n\r\nSo, thinks I would like to see are:\r\n1) How does this handle authentication/authorization.   I'm hoping we have some really nice support that can leverage what solr already has.\r\n2) I'm very curious to see \"how easy is it to expose a simple V2 Rest api\".

Replacing the current webapp is one of the main goals of the new UI, and if it is shipped separately / outside of Solr project, we may not be able to deprecate and replace the current webapp with it and we will end up with \"yet another Solr Admin tool\".

(getUsage() is being overriden because we need `bin/solr zk blah-blah` and the default does `bin/solr blah-blah`...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2283703009/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2283730826","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2593#issuecomment-2283730826","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2593","id":2283730826,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6IHveK","user":{"login":"epugh","id":22395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh","html_url":"https://github.com/epugh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-12T11:34:49Z","updated_at":"2024-08-12T11:34:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rahulgoswami  I updated the ref guide docs to cross link to an EXISTING page for the upconfig/downconfig etc commands...

From the community, I learned that the new changes in gradle-dependency-analyze (as detailed in gradle-dependency-analyze/gradle-dependency-analyze#527) have introduced these warnings. While some of these dependencies seem to be transitive, I cannot see them being directly used in the project. I wonder if there might be another reason for these warnings beyond them being transitive dependencies.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2286334024/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2286341006","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2643#issuecomment-2286341006","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2643","id":2286341006,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6IRsuO","user":{"login":"risdenk","id":3384157,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzODQxNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3384157?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk","html_url":"https://github.com/risdenk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-13T14:03:45Z","updated_at":"2024-08-13T14:03:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"These I think seem reasonable from a quick glance.

On the day when you switch to Java 17 or 21 as minimum version you get the forbiddenwarnings automatically (by both forbiddenapis and javac). Just fix them at that time.

I think one can easily fix the issues at that time.

But addings the forbidden signatures can be avoided as they get obsolete anyways.\r\n\r\n> For some reason, forbiddenApis didn't flag DocumentObjectBinder from solrj, even though it uses AccessController.\r\n\r\nThe method is already annotated with @SuppressForbidden, so the refactoring to a separate method is not helping anything.

Nowadays, I just want the build to be simpler.\r\n\r\nJIRA issues aren't required for build improvements in general.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2291555072/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2291627819","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2612#issuecomment-2291627819","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2612","id":2291627819,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6Il3cr","user":{"login":"dsmiley","id":377295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzI5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/377295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley","html_url":"https://github.com/dsmiley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-15T16:15:49Z","updated_at":"2024-08-15T16:15:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"`crave run -- ./jmh.sh CloudIndexing -jvmArgsAppend -Dsolr.bench.seed=823716671780822  -p useSmallDocs=true -p nodeCount=1 -p numShards=1 -p numReplicas=1 -I 8`\r\n\r\nThe benchmark module uses JettySolrRunner via MiniClusterState.\r\n\r\nGoogling for this is inconclusive as to the cause.  It seems the server is choosing to cancel the client's stream, but we don't know *why*.  I dug into this before and thought it was a rate limiting mechanism, so this PR disables that.  Perhaps the next step to debug is to ascertain what jetty config/logging would explain that.
