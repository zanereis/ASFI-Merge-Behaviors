notes from discussion with @tacigar \r\n\r\nI have service graph now, but I cannot tell if there is a problem with one node behavior\r\nif I want to understand behavior of a single machine in a service, I cannot do this today.\r\nthis is because the edges are aggregatate (parent, child, count), based on service name, not any other information in the endpoint such as IP address.\r\n\r\nThis can make certain problems difficult to understand, such as if one node in a service is running the wrong code, or if a new version of code only deployed to one node is causing a problem.\r\n\r\nSo, if I have a way to classify by another means, I can identify this type of behavior. For example, IP address. {(parent, ip), (child, ip), count)  the dependency link has one more qualifier than before, for this example IP address.\r\n\r\nThere are now many more nodes.. because what was before just service-service is now (service,ip) -> (service, ip). Inside one trace, this could be fine because maybe not that many combinations\r\n\r\n\r\nIP is just an example, user may want to explore by site tag like cluster or department or something else. The difference between this and normal dependency graph is we generate the links in javascript. This means we can aggregate by anything, not just service but also custom tag (like http.route).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/512646164/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/512647549","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/2656#issuecomment-512647549","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2656","id":512647549,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMjY0NzU0OQ==","user":{"login":"tacigar","id":19551419,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTUxNDE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19551419?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tacigar","html_url":"https://github.com/tacigar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tacigar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tacigar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tacigar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tacigar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tacigar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tacigar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tacigar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tacigar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tacigar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-18T03:10:24Z","updated_at":"2019-07-18T03:10:24Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Yes,

if you hit anything except the health endpoint first, it puts things into an unusable state. I think @anuraaga has some change in mind to fall back to unhealth checked names when health checking isn't complete yet. We need to solve this one way or another before release as when it is bad, most commands will return 503 and it isn't possible even to control-c out of it.\r\n\r\n```\r\n2019-07-20 15:54:08.774  WARN 39062 --- [-worker-nio-2-1] z.s.i.BodyIsExceptionMessage             : Unexpected error handling request.\r\n\r\ncom.linecorp.armeria.client.endpoint.EndpointGroupException: HealthCheckedEndpointGroup(all:], healthy:]) is empty\r\n\tat com.linecorp.armeria.client.endpoint.RoundRobinStrategy$RoundRobinSelector.select(RoundRobinStrategy.java:65) ~[armeria-0.88.0.jar!/:?]\r\n\tat com.linecorp.armeria.client.endpoint.EndpointGroupRegistry.selectNode(EndpointGroupRegistry.java:120) ~[armeria-0.88.0.jar!/:?]\r\n\tat com.linecorp.armeria.client.Endpoint.resolve(Endpoint.java:215) ~[armeria-0.88.0.jar!/:?]\r\n\tat com.linecorp.armeria.client.HttpClientDelegate.execute(HttpClientDelegate.java:61) ~[armeria-0.88.0.jar!/:?]\r\n\tat com.linecorp.armeria.client.HttpClientDelegate.execute(HttpClientDelegate.java:42) ~[armeria-0.88.0.jar!/:?]\r\n\tat com.linecorp.armeria.client.encoding.HttpDecodingClient.execute(HttpDecodingClient.java:92) ~[armeria-0.88.0.jar!/:?]\r\n\tat com.linecorp.armeria.client.encoding.HttpDecodingClient.execute(HttpDecodingClient.java:39) ~[armeria-0.88.0.jar!/:?]\r\n\tat com.linecorp.armeria.client.logging.LoggingClient.execute(LoggingClient.java:172) ~[armeria-0.88.0.jar!/:?]\r\n\tat zipkin2.elasticsearch.internal.client.RawContentLoggingClient.lambda$execute$0(RawContentLoggingClient.java:53) ~[zipkin-storage-elasticsearch-2.15.1-SNAPSHOT.jar!/:?]\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture.uniComposeStage(CompletableFuture.java:1106) ~[?:?]\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture.thenCompose(CompletableFuture.java:2235) ~[?:?]\r\n\tat zipkin2.elasticsearch.internal.client.RawContentLoggingClient.execute(RawContentLoggingClient.java:48) ~[zipkin-storage-elasticsearch-2.15.1-SNAPSHOT.jar!/:?]\r\n\tat zipkin2.elasticsearch.internal.client.RawContentLoggingClient.execute(RawContentLoggingClient.java:30) ~[zipkin-storage-elasticsearch-2.15.1-SNAPSHOT.jar!/:?]\r\n\tat com.linecorp.armeria.internal.ClientUtil.executeWithFallback(ClientUtil.java:42) ~[armeria-0.88.0.jar!/:?]\r\n\tat com.linecorp.armeria.client.UserClient.execute(UserClient.java:159) ~[armeria-0.88.0.jar!/:?]\r\n\tat com.linecorp.armeria.client.DefaultHttpClient.execute(DefaultHttpClient.java:61) ~[armeria-0.88.0.jar!/:?]\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/513443115/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/513443272","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2674#issuecomment-513443272","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2674","id":513443272,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMzQ0MzI3Mg==","user":{"login":"anuraaga","id":198344,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5ODM0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/198344?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga","html_url":"https://github.com/anuraaga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-20T07:01:24Z","updated_at":"2019-07-20T07:01:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This happened because we moved the `await` out of `httpObject` into `check` I guess.
