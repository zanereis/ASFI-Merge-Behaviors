In fact, I meet this problem when I'm testing my implementation of Deep Q Network. The training will be fine if I just run one DQN on a single GPU (I can repeat the results in the Nature paper for multiple Atari games). However, if I try to run two processes on the same GPU, the divergence problem occurs.\n\nIn my implementation, I generate two executors using the same set of QNet parameters, one for getting actions and another for updating the parameters. After one step of update using the updating executor, the action executor will need to generate actions using the updated parameters.

The problem disappears after I change the outputop of the Q network from NDArrayOp to NumpyOP. I'll try later to figure out the cause. Also, I'm using a single optimizer for two executors, but only one of them will do `forward(is_train=True)` and `backward()`. Another executor will only do `forward(is_train=False)`.

What I did was I split each convolution layer and gave each of them a ctx context. For example, I want to use two gpus, (\"dev0\", \"dev1\"). More specifically, I put half of the filters of each layer on each gpu, which means I defined two new layers with half of the fiters of the original one. Then after these two sublayers, I concatenate them in order to let the next layers use the whole part of the feature maps. I split all the conv layers in this way. The motive of doing this was to split the calculation burden, but I found the reality is not. It seems that the communication cost between two gpus has exceeded the benefit of spliting the calculation. The speed is way slower due to the frequent splitting  and concatenating.
