For DataNode in 'ReadOnly' status: It doesn't mean that the Region is in 'ReadOnly' status if the DataNode where the Region situated is currently 'ReadOnly'. Actually, we havn't defined in which scenario a Region is 'ReadOnly'. On the other hand, the ConfigNode-leader will consider a RegionGroup is 'Disabled' if one of its Region's located DataNode is 'ReadOnly'.\r\n2.
