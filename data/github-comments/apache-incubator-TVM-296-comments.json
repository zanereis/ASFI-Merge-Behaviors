I find it easiest to use [pkg_search_module](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindPkgConfig.html#command:pkg_search_module) which uses PKGConfig to find the

Please see this PR https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/9135. I understand why you want to do this, namely, constant fold `quantize(weight_fp32)` in a QNN graph. Returning float32 weights from the PyTorch frontend and relying on Relay constant folding to recover quantized weights was my design mistake. Now you can directly obtain quantized weights from the frontend (we do quantize at numpy level).\r\n\r\n@manupa-arm Running lowering before const fold is not acceptable when we want to keep the rest of QNN graphs (BYOC), while selectively lower constant subgraphs and evaluate them.

Thanks @mikepapadim . One thing that would be very helpful is to split the logic into two parts:\r\n> \r\n>     * A function that configures and returns the composite Pass(aka the sequential)\r\n> \r\n>     * A function that uses the above function to construct the composite pass and execute the optimization.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> As part of python first principle, we want to enable ways to access and tweak optimizations in python easily. While majority of the default logic can sit in c++. It would be super helpful to have a python function that returns the composite pipeline, and possibly allow us to do further customizations (in python) if necessary and invoke them.\r\n\r\nThanks @tqchen. So, we want to expose on the python side the ability to register additional passes for `mixed_mod`, `device_mod` and `host_mod` per pass manager when we are doing the split?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/937972179/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/937985447","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/9216#issuecomment-937985447","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/9216","id":937985447,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM436IWn","user":{"login":"mehrdadh","id":6409345,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MDkzNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6409345?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehrdadh","html_url":"https://github.com/mehrdadh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehrdadh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehrdadh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehrdadh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehrdadh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehrdadh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehrdadh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehrdadh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehrdadh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehrdadh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-07T17:03:13Z","updated_at":"2021-10-07T17:03:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I tried to reproduce this.

fixed some namespace and style issues.  Could you please help review this PR? @junrushao1994 @jcf94 @msakai @jroesch \r\n\r\nAnd I have some questions to discuss:\r\n1. The `forward` function is not thread-safe. Should we use a mutex to make it thread-safe?\r\n2. We load the tvm module from files (mod.so, graph.json, params). But if we pass the relative path of the .so file, it may cause unexpected results. Consider this case: we have `export_dir1/mod.so` and `export_dir2/mod.so`,  chdir into `export_dir1` and load `./mod.so`, then chdir into `export_dir2` and try to load `./mod.so`, but `export_dir2/mod.so` will not be loaded! One possible solution is to translate the filepath to absolute path before `dlopen` in `src/runtime/dso_library.cc`. What's your opinion?\r\n3. We store tvm graph modules in a map `tvm_modules_` and use input tensors' shapes as the key. But this requires all the input tensors to have a fixed shape. In order to support dynamic shapes, we may need to iterate all the keys of `tvm_modules_` to find a matched one. Is it necessary to support dynamic shapes? If it is, how can we do it efficiently?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/938528754/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/938541756","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/9205#issuecomment-938541756","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/9205","id":938541756,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM438QK8","user":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-08T10:46:19Z","updated_at":"2021-10-08T10:46:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"After this fix, in some sparse workloads the real reduction block becomes invalid.

So here comes the contradiction:\r\n* if we stick to this fix (prohibiting any iter whose extent depends on other iters), the block cannot be viewed as a reduction block;\r\n* if we still want to view the block as a reduction block, we should allow the iters whose extents depend on others.\r\n\r\nOr another option is to remove the \"affine binding\" condition for reduction blocks.\r\n\r\n@junrushao1994 @spectrometerHBH Want to here your opinions on how to get this issue fixed :-)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/938541756/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/938630828","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/9103#issuecomment-938630828","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/9103","id":938630828,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM438l6s","user":{"login":"mikepapadim","id":8652854,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTI4NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8652854?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikepapadim","html_url":"https://github.com/mikepapadim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikepapadim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikepapadim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikepapadim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikepapadim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikepapadim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikepapadim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikepapadim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikepapadim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikepapadim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-08T13:10:11Z","updated_at":"2021-10-08T13:10:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"PTAL \r\nIf it is in a good state we can have a follow-up PR with just for adding the flexibility on adding passes on the separate module managers from the python side.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/938630828/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/938704198","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/9220#issuecomment-938704198","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/9220","id":938704198,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM43831G","user":{"login":"kparzysz-quic","id":48801706,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4ODAxNzA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48801706?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic","html_url":"https://github.com/kparzysz-quic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-08T14:51:59Z","updated_at":"2021-10-08T14:51:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This is great!\r\n\r\nI just started testing it, and the first thing I saw was a bunch of warnings from the Android NDK cmake:\r\n```\r\nndk-bundle/build/cmake/android.toolchain.cmake:449 (message):\r\n  An old version of CMake is being used that cannot automatically detect\r\n  compiler attributes.

For example:\r\n- `ctypes.pythonapi.Py_IncRef` corresponds to `Py_IncRef` in Python.h\r\n- `ctypes.pythonapi.Py_DecRef` corresponds to `Py_DecRef` in Python.h\r\n- `ctypes.pythonapi.PyMem_RawMalloc` corresponds to `PyMem_RawMalloc` in Python.h\r\n- `ctypes.pythonapi.PyMem_RawFree` corresponds to `PyMem_RawFree` in Python.h\r\n\r\nTherefore, instead of registering cython method, what about we register apis under `ctypes.pythonapi` after CDLL is loaded with ctypes?
