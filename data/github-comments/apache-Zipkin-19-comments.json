The framework used is Finatra 2, which is far more supportable than Ostrich.\n\nI've ideas for follow-up work, including moving the web server also to Finatra and/or replacing it with a pure javascript app, which could be hosted on the query server (and drop the need for zipkin-web entirely). We can also look at removing ostrich completely from zipkin-query-service, porting the query config scala files to finatra/twitter-inject modules. I hope that this work will help others build on zipkin, and help us finish the tech debt clearing.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/143642986/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/143645841","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/718#issuecomment-143645841","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/718","id":143645841,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MzY0NTg0MQ==","user":{"login":"mzagar","id":896701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NjcwMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/896701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzagar","html_url":"https://github.com/mzagar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzagar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzagar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzagar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzagar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzagar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzagar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzagar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzagar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzagar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-28T05:51:09Z","updated_at":"2015-09-28T05:51:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I believe I can take a look at this one.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/143645841/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/143647604","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/718#issuecomment-143647604","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/718","id":143647604,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MzY0NzYwNA==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-28T06:08:00Z","updated_at":"2015-09-28T06:08:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Great.
