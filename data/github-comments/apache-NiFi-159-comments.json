this implementation here relies upon the NiFi user configuring all the current Elasticsearch hosts and keeping them updated if the cluster membership changes.\r\n\r\nAlso, the Elasticsearch client will temporarily stop trying to connect to a host it knows is not responding - this PR will instead result in operations failing for any hosts that go offline (for example) and the NiFi user will need to cater for that, e.g. with a Retry loop on failure\r\n\r\nThat's not to say that this approach isn't a potentially useful option for Elasticsearch cluster users, it certainly avoids the need for them to introduce a load balancer in front of Elasticsearch if they don't already have one, and it will mean that if the single host they were able to connect with previously were to go offline, then others being configured in the processors means operations would work at least some of the time.\r\n\r\nGenerally I'd recommend people using the Elasticsearch Client-based processors where possible, but these OkHttp based processors have some functionality that the newer ES Client ones don't currently, so they're still relevant and this update feels like it's probably going to be useful.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/912966926/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/912967113","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5299#issuecomment-912967113","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5299","id":912967113,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM42asXJ","user":{"login":"ChrisSamo632","id":12159006,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTU5MDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12159006?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632","html_url":"https://github.com/ChrisSamo632","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-04T12:35:52Z","updated_at":"2021-09-04T12:36:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@eylonronen there are Checkstyle failures with your changes, please try building the `nifi-elasticsearch-bundle` with a `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean verify` command and check the output for the checkstyle failures (often this is an unused import or a line of code that's too long).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/912967113/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/912969553","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5299#issuecomment-912969553","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5299","id":912969553,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM42as9R","user":{"login":"ChrisSamo632","id":12159006,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTU5MDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12159006?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632","html_url":"https://github.com/ChrisSamo632","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-04T12:52:43Z","updated_at":"2021-09-04T12:53:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Hi @ChrisSamo632\r\n> I don't understand where and how to preform those unit tests...

Using `File.separator()` seems reasonable either way, so the changes look good.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/913809834/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/914373196","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5330#issuecomment-914373196","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5330","id":914373196,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM42gDpM","user":{"login":"tpalfy","id":53442425,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNDQyNDI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53442425?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy","html_url":"https://github.com/tpalfy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-07T14:52:45Z","updated_at":"2021-09-07T14:52:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGATM+1\r\nMerged

Overall it looks good. Other than stuff like how the log messages are handled and finals I think there are a few things to look at:\r\n> \r\n> * I think the various inserts could be simplified. We have `insertWithTransactionalBatch()`, `insertRecord()`, `chooseInsertMethodAndRun()`, and `bulkInsert()`. I think it gets a little confusing. I think `insertRecord()` and `insertWithTransactionalBatch()` could be combined if there were a branch with `if (records.size() == 1)`.\r\n> * We need to handle more error cases. In particular 413 (Entity too large).\r\n> * I don't totally understand the yield handling in `onTrigger()`. Can you explain that a little more?\r\n\r\nTo me, yield handing, thus putting the current flowfile into the queue for retry, seems to make sense when server-side throttling is happening and server-side RU change is in progress.

There's also another PR up that we're working through (https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4948) to add more record-based scripted components. We need to be ruthlessly diligent about what we introduce here. We really want simplicity & usability here over power. ExecuteScript, etc. give us power, while this should yield simplicity.\r\n- If we do introduce Registry, we've perhaps started down a slipper slope. What happens when someone then needs a different type of Controller Service? A Record Lookup Service, for example. Do we then add another property for RecordLookupService? What if we need a StringLookupService instead of a RecordLookupService? Do we add yet another property for that? Now this is far from simple.\r\n- The notion of a \"RegistryHelper\" is nebulous. Whatever gets injected in, if it's a complex object, needs to have a properly formed API/interface with sufficient JavaDocs that explain exactly how it is used, and we need to protect that API/interface as new versions come out & things evolve.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I do see benefit in having the ability to reference Controller Services.\r\nSo what I would propose would be to attack this a bit differently. Instead of adding a \"Schema Registry\" property we could allow for user-defined properties. The name of the property would be the variable binding for the script. The dynamic property descriptor would then identify a Controller Service of type ControllerService. I.e., any Controller Service. In this way, a user can inject in 1 or more Controller Services of any type.

There are a few things that are going to get refactored, some optimized. There are some TODOs that I still need to work on (e.g. the processor's property validation is missing). The documentation is far from being complete.\r\nHowever, the field removal logic can now be reviewed and tested. For anyone reviewing this: a way to understand this logic is to start with the easiest unit test (the unit tests get more complicated from top to bottom in the order they are present in the TestRemoveRecordField class), and debug its execution all the way. The unit tests cover many complex cases of record handling and going through them will explain why certain parts are implemented as they are.\r\nFeedback is highly appreciated.

You are correct, the intention is to use `STRING` type when `useLogicalTypes` is `false`.\r\n\r\nThis idea comes from the implementation of JdbcCommon class:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/main/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-extension-utils/nifi-database-utils/src/main/java/org/apache/nifi/util/db/JdbcCommon.java\r\nIn JdbcCommon, in each case when `options.useLogicalTypes` is false and otherwise the type in question would require avro logical type, `STRING` type is returned.\r\n\r\nIn RecordSqlWriter, this behavior is correct until (including) this line:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/4af3fac07a521b8334b36e55ad9b4929e182c3d8/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-standard-bundle/nifi-standard-processors/src/main/java/org/apache/nifi/processors/standard/sql/RecordSqlWriter.java#L72\r\nHowever, the next line overwrites the settings in the original implementation and avro logical types do appear in the result.\r\nSo the goal of this fix is to unify the behavior when having avro logical types in the result is to be avoided.\r\n\r\nI believe it does make sense to use `STRING` as the default type for Date, Time, and Decimal columns, but @mattyb149 may be able to provide more background information on this decision.\r\n\r\nCurrently I'm not planning to add further unit tests with actual data content (merely because I'm trying to save a little time), I'm concentrating on checking the proper schema creation. I found that some branches of the logic are not yet covered by the tests that exist so far, so I'm working on adding more cases (with concentrating on schema only).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/920928975/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/920943734","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5388#issuecomment-920943734","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5388","id":920943734,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM425Hx2","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-16T14:17:07Z","updated_at":"2021-09-16T14:17:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the clarification on the design @pgyori, that makes sense.

At a high level, is the a reason for requiring secrets to be stored as JSON objects? It seems like requiring the JSON object wrapping around `value` introduces potential complexity when populating secrets from other tools. Why not just use `secretString` directly as the parameter value?\r\n> \r\n> On closer inspection, I see that the HashiCorp Vault Parameter Value Provider does require the wrapping object, but perhaps that is something to revisit as well.\r\n\r\nGreat question -- regarding AWS SecretsManager, it looks like I missed in AWS's documentation the possibility of setting a plain value instead of the \"key/value pair\" format that translates to JSON.  I agree that the simple value is the best approach, and will make that change.\r\n\r\nRegarding HashiCorp Vault, I believe this is the only way Secrets are represented in the K/V Secrets Engine (see https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/vault/getting-started-first-secret).  So when you put a secret like this:\r\n```\r\nvault kv put secret/hello foo=world\r\n```\r\nthen the secret is represented as { \"foo\": \"world\" } in the API.  However, if I find a way to avoid using JSON with Vault, I'll address that as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/922316815/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/922323775","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5391#issuecomment-922323775","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5391","id":922323775,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM42-Ys_","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-18T14:54:47Z","updated_at":"2021-09-18T14:54:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the reply and reference to HashiCorp Vault documentation @gresockj.
