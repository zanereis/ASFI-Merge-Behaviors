It extends the type definitions for existing types like `Vertex`, `Edge`, and `VertexProperty` and it also adds a new utility method `parseVertex` which can be used to create a `Vertex` object where a `VertexProperty` is directly a property of the object, e.g., `vertex.name`.\r\n\r\nI think it would be good to separate these two things from each other. Could you please create issues for them in our JIRA? Our usual development workflow is to first have an issue there which describes the bug / proposed improvement and afterwards create the PR. This also makes it possible to first discuss the issue before actually implementing it.\r\n\r\nIn this case, I'm not 100% about the added utility method. It sounds to me like it's a first step in the direction of the [_Sugar Plugin_](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/reference/#sugar-plugin) for Groovy and I'm not sure whether we should implement such syntactic sugar for the GLVs like gremlin-javascript.\r\nBut maybe I'm just missing context why this is useful for Javascript / Typescript. You could probably better describe your motivation for this in the JIRA issue.\r\n\r\nSorry for the slight push back here in general. Your Typescript improvements are more than welcome, but I think they are difficult for us to review since we simply lack some experience in this area. That is why I think that following this process helps as it makes it easier for other contributors to better understand the improvements before reviewing them.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/2112453850/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/2112648089","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2602#issuecomment-2112648089","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/2602","id":2112648089,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc597HOZ","user":{"login":"FlorianHockmann","id":21224336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjI0MzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21224336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann","html_url":"https://github.com/FlorianHockmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-15T14:06:12Z","updated_at":"2024-05-15T14:06:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Looks

I do think if we are to add this for vertices in JS, we need to do the equivalent for edges.\r\n\r\nIn terms of naming, an alternative worth considering might be `flattenVertex` but this isn't something I feel strongly about.\r\n\r\nThe overall implementation looks good to me, although I wonder if the need to provide explicit cardinality schemas for anything other than singles will limit the convenience upside here. It would be cool if there was an option to try and detect the cardinality of each property, and only force a conversion if the user explicitly specifies an override. Granted this would currently be limited to just single and list, as set is currently blocked by [TINKERPOP-3011](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TINKERPOP-3011)\r\n\r\nIn general, if this is something that JS users want in the GLV, then I'm willing to put aside some of the cross-GLV consistency concerns here. I think it's worth a quick dev list thread just to ensure the design is aligned with the community.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/2118255079/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/2118414811","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2607#issuecomment-2118414811","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/2607","id":2118414811,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc5-RHHb","user":{"login":"Cole-Greer","id":112986082,"node_id":"U_kgDOBrwH4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112986082?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer","html_url":"https://github.com/Cole-Greer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-17T21:40:42Z","updated_at":"2024-05-17T21:40:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @vatsalcode, thanks for opening this PR.

age,\r\n    name,\r\n    addresses\r\n  };\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich with the utility function can be simplified to\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst vertices = await g.V().hasLabel(\"person\").toList<PersonVertex>();\r\nconst people = vertices.map(vertex => parseVertex(vertex, { address: \"list\" }));\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/2118834748/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/2118834947","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2599#issuecomment-2118834947","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/2599","id":2118834947,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc5-StsD","user":{"login":"tien","id":19813755,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5ODEzNzU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19813755?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tien","html_url":"https://github.com/tien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-18T14:04:01Z","updated_at":"2024-05-18T14:04:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm

@HappyHacker123, much apologies for the late reply. I gave it some more thoughts, and while this will be a great improvement, I don't think we are quite ready to centralize these dependencies yet. The complexity is mainly due to the way dependencies are currently managed that’s leading to conflicts and may require module-specific versions, especially in hadoop and spark modules (as you may see some of the code comments in the poms). We are looking to improve this systemically, but before a decision is reached I think we’ll hold off on this PR and close it for now. \r\n\r\nIf you are still interested and have thoughts or recommendations related to dependency management, chime into our discussions for [removing gremlin-shaded](https://lists.apache.org/thread/m7yvvz9zc69nzn0nr6vz0tdo3ggffoy6) and [JPMS](https://lists.apache.org/thread/vkvqcxn6t2lsgpfym7v3g3qvksrh3cwc). We'd love to see more opinions on these topics. Again, thank you for taking the time submitting this PR!

for all of the work on this, it is a big step forward to have modern gremlin-lang based translators.\r\n\r\nI primarily focused my review on the Go and JS translators here as it is a big PR and hard to capture everything at once. Prior to the release of TP4, I would like to add some tests to ensure successful translation of some of the more obscure literals, however I think that can be out of scope for this PR as the new translators are at least as well tested as the old ones.\r\n\r\nVOTE
