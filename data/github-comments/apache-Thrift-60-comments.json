And the Common Lisp language backend seems to be quite complete, stable and generates efficient code. I use it to talk to Accumulo via the Accumulo Proxy and that allows for high ingestion rates as I have described in this article \"Almost 600,000 entries per second from Lisp to Accumulo\" at https://observablehq.com/@m-g-r/almost-600000-entries-per-second-from-lisp-to-accumulo As written in section \"Comparison\", it seems safe to argue that in this test we achieve a comparable raw ingestion performance to similar measurements of the ingestion rate to Apache Accumulo.\r\n\r\nI was basically frankly surprised that you just remove such a complete language backend given that seems this seems to be the very thing Apache Thrift is about: a \"language-independent software stack\" allowing \"programs written in different programming languages\" to communicate with each other.\r\n\r\nAdmittingly, I just use James' `de.setf.thrift` at https://github.com/lisp/de.setf.thrift directly and have just thrift via the Ubuntu package thrift-compiler installed to generate the lisp code from the thrift definition file...\r\n\r\nHm, THRIFT-5410 “CL build broken: Component :NET.DIDIERVERNA.CLON.TERMIO not found” is according to your email https://www.mail-archive.com/dev@thrift.apache.org/msg50775.html just a test not running, right? In file \"thrift/src/test/cl/make-test-server.lisp\" and that breaks your build system, or rather the continuous integration service? That test uses Didier's `clon` to parse commond-line options in a standalone application `TestClient`.\r\n\r\nLet me see if I can reproduce that. Currently looking at make running to build thrift which seems to take a while.\r\n\r\nCheers, Max","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/1224319945/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/1224430745","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/2538#issuecomment-1224430745","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2538","id":1224430745,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAS9U85I-1SZ","user":{"login":"m-g-r","id":7143985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNDM5ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7143985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-g-r","html_url":"https://github.com/m-g-r","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-g-r/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-g-r/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-g-r/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-g-r/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-g-r/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-g-r/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-g-r/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-g-r/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-g-r/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-23T17:37:47Z","updated_at":"2022-08-23T17:37:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @Jens-G,\r\n\r\nI've made a workaround to alleviate THRIFT-5410. The problem is that the system :NET.DIDIERVERNA.CLON was subdivided in a way that the version of the package loader ASDF that is used here cannot find. The workaround locates that subsystem clon.termio explicitly.\r\n\r\nYou'll find the changes in https://github.com/m-g-r/thrift/tree/THRIFT-5410 (Of course, I had to revert the commit [\"THRIFT-5501 Remove Common Lisp support\"](https://github.com/apache/thrift/commit/5fecc439f5244fd8585cb053877074dd1d170c30) first.)\r\n\r\nI have run the checks and all seems to work now. I have only tested with cl support. That is, I deactivated the other language bindings that would otherwise run and take quite a bit of time, by running configure as:\r\n```\r\n./configure --with-ruby=no --with-php=no --with-nodejs=no --with-cpp=no --with-python=no\r\n```\r\nMind you, this problem was just about running tests. The Common Lisp Thrift backend itself seems to be really stable. I am using it for months now.\r\n\r\nAre there any other problems?

Another suggestion, which can be done in a follow-up PR instead, but doing it in this PR will help a lot of the test code:\r\n> \r\n> Define a `ValidationError` type in go library, and implement `Unwrap` on `tApplicationException` so that when a `TApplicationException` is validation error it can also unwrap to that, that way when checking for `ValidationError` you can use its fields to determine what's the check (e.g. `vt.const`) and what's the field that failed validation.\r\n\r\nsorry for the late reply, I have defined a `ValidationError` in application_exception.go and add a `NewValidationException` which is used to construct tApplicationExcetion with ValidationError.
