more issues popped up:\r\n\r\nA large number of configuration parameters have not been ported yet (see [FLINK-4765](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-4765)) which means that we cannot use this for all options right away.\r\n\r\nMore importantly, our organization of ConfigOptions isn't coherent with the existing organization in the docs. For example, all JobManager and WebFrontend options live in `JobManagerOptions`, but in the docs they are 2 different tables. The same issue applies to the Security Options, with SSL, Kerberos and Zookeper sharing the same file.\r\n\r\nCreating the tables based on the ConfigOption classes does not appear to be granular enough to provide a good documentation.\r\n\r\nI'm currently leaning towards adding annotations that group the contained config options based on a key prefix. Here's an example how it could look like for the `SecurityOptions`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@ConfigGroups(\r\n\t@ConfigGroup(\"Kerberos\", \"security.kerberos\"),\r\n\t@ConfigGroup(\"SSL, \"security.ssl\"),\r\n\t@ConfigGroup(\"Zookeeper\", \"zookeeper\"))\r\npublic class SecurityOptions {\r\n...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example we would use this annotation to generate 3 different tables, with proper names.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/300146416/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/300147443","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3824#issuecomment-300147443","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3824","id":300147443,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMDE0NzQ0Mw==","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-09T12:27:42Z","updated_at":"2017-05-09T12:27:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"merging.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/300147443/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/300147518","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3736#issuecomment-300147518","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3736","id":300147518,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMDE0NzUxOA==","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-09T12:28:00Z","updated_at":"2017-05-09T12:28:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"merging.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/300147518/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/300147576","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3831#issuecomment-300147576","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3831","id":300147576,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMDE0NzU3Ng==","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-09T12:28:14Z","updated_at":"2017-05-09T12:28:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"merging

When something like this is put into place it naturally follows that some contributions that are ready around the time of the FF will not be merged. Given that the FF was already delayed by a week, implicitly giving every contribution a 1 week grace period, I don't see a reason to make an exception here. It wasn't merged before the FF; it wasn't merged before the delayed FF, so it's not going into the release.\r\n\r\nThat's my take on the whole thing.\r\n\r\nPS: Me closing this PR was not meant to imply \"and that's the end of it\". I just amended the commit before this discussion started and didn't remove it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/300399778/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/300406137","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3495#issuecomment-300406137","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3495","id":300406137,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMDQwNjEzNw==","user":{"login":"dawidwys","id":6242259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNDIyNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6242259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys","html_url":"https://github.com/dawidwys","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-10T08:01:07Z","updated_at":"2017-05-10T08:01:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"There is a problem with the prefix solution.

So a module referencing this (like `flink-java`) will not see what `flink-shaded-hadoop2` contains. This can cause problems like having classes in the classpath multiple times. Maven can not \"manage\" the dependencies in that case, because it does not know what's `flink-shaded-hadoop2`.\r\n\r\nI don't have a good answer how to solve this.\r\nSome ideas:\r\n- relocate all Hadoop dependencies in the `flink-shaded-hadoop2` artifact. Then, we won't run into the original problem anymore. I've tried this once, but I was running into problems getting the YARN tests running afterwards\r\n- introduce a special \"flink-shaded-hadoop2-dist\" module that prepares a fat dist hadoop jar for the binary distribution. This way, we can differentiate between `flink-shaded-hadoop2` as a dependency and for the binary. But I think this will lead to problems when building `flink-dist`...\r\n- merge this PR as is and hope that the problems don't occur (I think this is mostly relevant for people using Hadoop code in their user jar, for example when doing some Hadoop compatibility stuff)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/300502695/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/300507813","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3854#issuecomment-300507813","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3854","id":300507813,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMDUwNzgxMw==","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-10T14:53:35Z","updated_at":"2017-05-10T14:53:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've renamed all snapshots/savepoints that I could find.
