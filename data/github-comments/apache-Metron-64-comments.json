If you want the TL;DR version to verify the template command, run the command in the README for creating the ES template. Then do the following:\r\n\r\nMake sure you have at least 1 other sensor with data, e.g. Bro. In full dev you should be set, otherwise cat data from our unit tests (https://github.com/apache/metron/blob/master/metron-platform/metron-integration-test/src/main/sample/data/bro/raw/BroExampleOutput) into the `bro` Kafka topic and make sure the bro topology is running.\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\n```\r\nwget https://github.com/apache/metron/raw/master/metron-platform/metron-integration-test/src/main/sample/data/bro/raw/BroExampleOutput -O ~/sample-bro.json\r\ncat

Otherwise, we would need more refactoring in the CLI to drop the output in the same HDFS directory rather than it be user specifiable and output locally.  Ultimately, while they use the same mechanism, the UX is different between the two approaches (e.g. the CLI entirely cleans up after itself and outputs to the local directory whereas the REST approach stores the results in HDFS until manual cleanup).\r\n* If a job is running while the REST API dies, we should consider that job to be runaway and needs to be killed by the admin or left to complete without the result being published.  One thing that we might consider doing is enabling the job naming to have a prefix of `METRON_REST_PCAP` so, upon REST start, it can kill existing jobs.  I think for THIS PR, we should just have REST pcap jobs have that prefix and leave it to a follow-on PR to do the actual killing.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/400736993/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/400740411","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1081#issuecomment-400740411","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1081","id":400740411,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMDc0MDQxMQ==","user":{"login":"cestella","id":540359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella","html_url":"https://github.com/cestella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-27T16:25:14Z","updated_at":"2018-06-27T16:25:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"One thing I didn't see.
