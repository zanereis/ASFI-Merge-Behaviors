@borisroman - I sincerely don't grok the benefits of these changes, which is why I'm asking what are the benefits of the changes?\n\nSome potential issues I can think of, wrt changing file names and paths are: (1) doing branch maintenance will become difficult, so cherry-picks and backporting bugfixes will become error prone, (2) while switching branches IDEs will be slow as they would need to re-index files/paths, (3) it becomes difficult to diff across branches (like git diff branch1..branch2 some/file/path/file.txt) as files/paths have changed (I for example run sanity checks in db related files to make sure we don't change older db paths etc). \n\nWhile I understand, Maven users want to have convention over configuration, other than that argument I don't understand the pros.

@bhaisaab \n\nThe first thing is that using a standard is better than doing the way nobody else is doing. When one adopts a technology is essential to stick with what that technology has standardised. It help in the long run when other people, used to that technology, will join the project. In addition, ACS is not our only Maven project. So, sticking with the standard is great.\n\nNothing personal, but I'm not a fan of `the only issue for me is that most users are not as agile as we want them to be.` those kind or arguments. We have to improve, as much as we can, and it should not be stopped because other users cannot improve. What we do is to make our work better and also to help them see the better way of doing things. A bit philosophical, but I believe that we have to lead by example.\n\nThis code should have been merged before the 4.7 cut.\n\nMore on this: https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/164371097/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/164374286","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1165#issuecomment-164374286","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1165","id":164374286,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NDM3NDI4Ng==","user":{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-14T08:12:55Z","updated_at":"2015-12-14T08:12:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@priyankparihar Fair enough, please see a code review comment.

Take a look at the size of the method “allocVolume”, there are more than 100 lines, that is terrible to write a test case. We should start creating little chunks of code, test them as unit, and then we can write integration tests.\n\nSomething like this would do: \nprotected String getVolumeNameFromCommand(CreateVolumeCmd cmd){\n        String userSpecifiedName = cmd.getVolumeName();\n        if (userSpecifiedName == null || userSpecifiedName.isEmpty()) {\n            userSpecifiedName = getRandomVolumeName();\n        }\n    return userSpecifiedName;\n}\n\nAfter that, you can write test cases to check if the method “getVolumeNameFromCommand” is doing its job as expected. That means, one test to check if it calls “getRandomVolumeName” and returns the value of that call when “cmd.getVolumeName()” returns null and other when it returns empty.\n\nI would also add a third test case to check if the method cmd.getVolumeName() returns something that is not empty, if that value is properly returned.\n\nHaving said that, I would also ask, is “            ” (string with a lot of space empty for you?) Because, for me empty is “”, this “         ” is blank, and this way we have another test case to write a make sure everything is proper coded.\n\nFor Java, empty is \"\", which means if cmd.getVolumeName() returns \"             \", that is the value that will be used.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/164482127/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/164483340","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1240#issuecomment-164483340","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1240","id":164483340,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NDQ4MzM0MA==","user":{"login":"DaanHoogland","id":2486961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODY5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2486961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland","html_url":"https://github.com/DaanHoogland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-14T16:22:31Z","updated_at":"2015-12-14T16:22:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@agneya2001 The definition as I gave you is used in th 'bubble' to create the environment (including settings) before running the test in a deployDatacenter.py run.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/164483340/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/164489480","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1243#issuecomment-164489480","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1243","id":164489480,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NDQ4OTQ4MA==","user":{"login":"DaanHoogland","id":2486961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODY5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2486961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland","html_url":"https://github.com/DaanHoogland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-14T16:42:04Z","updated_at":"2015-12-14T16:42:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Don't go here. this is about licensing.

there was no strong argument about it. @bhaisaab doesn't as point that can stop a merge. He simply wants to make his daily tasks easier - probably because he has to keep old releases, like 4.4.x/4.5.x.\n\nIf we release 10 versions in an year, it will be a burden for certain business model - until they adapt. But that's what we want, because it will improve quality and many other things.\n\nIt should have been merged. It wasn't, but should have been. I'm not saying it has to. :)\n\nI will let you guys decide about it.
