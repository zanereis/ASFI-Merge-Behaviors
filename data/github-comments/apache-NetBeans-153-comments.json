did a first pass and these are my notes:\r\n\r\n- All: The module names should not contain the folder name prefix `rust.XXXX -`, just the part after the \"dash\"\r\n- All: The commits should be squashed at least partially (19 seems to be to much)\r\n- Grammar: The *.interp and *.tokens files from  org.netbeans.modules.rust.grammar.antlr4 package can be dropped. Then the licenseinfo.xml passage can be dropped as the java files already contain the ASF header.\r\n- Grammar: Is it a good idea to modify the grammers (RustLexer.g4 and RustParser.g4) directly? For the CSS parser direct modifications were done and the grammar became disconnected from its origin, without an option to ever get updates from the source. This is ok, we just should now, whether we want to go down that road.\r\n- Grammar: The build script rebuilds the java code from the grammar, yet the generated code is checked in. In other cases (golang, CSS) we generate the java code once and there are instructions in the generated files, that changes have to be made in the grammar files and rebuilding the java files is necessary.\r\n- Grammar: the Icons in org.netbeans.modules.rust.grammar.structure.resources need entries in the licenseinfo.xml\r\n- Project: It is surprising, that the \"files\" view shows less, than the \"projects\" view. All other types I'm aware of show a subset of data in the projects view and the files view gives access to data filterer in the project view\r\n- Project: The ZIP file should not be there. There are two issues with this: we should not add ZIP files to two repository as the contents can be checked in directly. This then also allows to use the input in the wizard to update the `Cargo.toml` accordingly.

Will do in next commits.\r\n\r\n> \r\n>     * All: The commits should be squashed at least partially (19 seems to be to much)\r\n\r\nI'd squash squash all commits, I think. Will do in coming days.\r\n\r\n> \r\n>     * Grammar: The *.interp and *.tokens files from  org.netbeans.modules.rust.grammar.antlr4 package can be dropped. Then the licenseinfo.xml passage can be dropped as the java files already contain the ASF header.\r\n> \r\n\r\nGreat. I think \"*.tokens\" is read when generating the grammar, but it's ok to leave it out of the repository.\r\n\r\n>     * Grammar: Is it a good idea to modify the grammers (RustLexer.g4 and RustParser.g4) directly? For the CSS parser direct modifications were done and the grammar became disconnected from its origin, without an option to ever get updates from the source. This is ok, we just should now, whether we want to go down that road.\r\n\r\nI think RustLexer.g4 and RustParser.g4 must be included. These files are probably going to change frequently in the future, and we want everybody to contribute to them. This includes the original authors: the Rust Team.\r\n\r\n> \r\n>     * Grammar: The build script rebuilds the java code from the grammar, yet the generated code is checked in. In other cases (golang, CSS) we generate the java code once and there are instructions in the generated files, that changes have to be made in the grammar files and rebuilding the java files is necessary.\r\n> \r\n\r\nWe may or may not include the generated code. The \"rust.grammar/build.xml\" is responsible for updating the generated code before compilation whenever the `.g4` files are modified.\r\n\r\n>     * Grammar: the Icons in org.netbeans.modules.rust.grammar.structure.resources need entries in the licenseinfo.xml\r\n> \r\n\r\nVery true. I ran `verify-libs-and-licenses` and no problems where detected, though. Thanks for pinpointing them.\r\n\r\n>     * Project: It is surprising, that the \"files\" view shows less, than the \"projects\" view. All other types I'm aware of show a subset of data in the projects view and the files view gives access to data filterer in the project view\r\n> \r\n\r\nWill verify this. Any file missing in particular?\r\n\r\n>     * Project: The ZIP file should not be there. There are two issues with this: we should not add ZIP files to two repository as the contents can be checked in directly. This then also allows to use the input in the wizard to update the `Cargo.toml` accordingly. The .gitignore file can be trivially created on the fly.\r\n\r\n+1 to that. Will modify the wizard.\r\n\r\n> \r\n>     * Project API: src/org/netbeans/modules/rust/project/api/rust-logo.png is not used.\r\n\r\n+1\r\n\r\n> \r\n>     * Sources: The file `src/org/netbeans/modules/rust/sources/rs/templates/rust-file.png` should use `COMMENT_UNSUPPORTED`\r\n\r\n+1\r\n\r\nThanks for the thorough review, Matthias.\r\n\r\nExpect some changes during next week as time permits.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1445464789/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1445466466","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/5567#issuecomment-1445466466","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5567","id":1445466466,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5WKBFi","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-26T21:01:54Z","updated_at":"2023-02-26T21:01:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vieiro

In the version I looked at, it starts a timer when the progress is not 0 or 100% and does a JComponent.repaint() for each timer iteration. By contrast, the BasicProgressBarUI does this only when the progress is indeterminate. I guess AquaProgressBarUI does this beause the progress bar used to have a sort of \"glowing\" effect in the past, this may be a leftover from this.\r\n\r\nThe repaint() then appears to be causing \"something\" in the OGL render pipeline that, under certain conditions that I do not understand, causes to put load on the GPU. Interestingly, this is not shown in Activity Monitor as GPU usage, just the power consumption goes up. Which I would say is correct looking at temperatures measured by the machine and my lap temperature sensor.\r\n\r\nSo, not a NetBeans issue and thus closing here.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1449396905/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1449715018","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/5552#issuecomment-1449715018","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5552","id":1449715018,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5WaOVK","user":{"login":"bob-tee","id":116080682,"node_id":"U_kgDOButAKg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116080682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob-tee","html_url":"https://github.com/bob-tee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob-tee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob-tee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob-tee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob-tee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob-tee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob-tee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob-tee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob-tee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob-tee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-01T09:43:40Z","updated_at":"2023-03-01T09:43:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for the input.
