I think the simplest method is to update the `docker-ci` case (which is simplest case for now), and execute the `shutdown.sh` after OAP is healthy, to see whether it's terminated.\r\n\r\nThe benefit is reducing the overall time of the entire workflows. `JDK-version` costs much more time than `docker-ci` already.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/849261062/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/849288719","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/7023#issuecomment-849288719","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/7023","id":849288719,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0OTI4ODcxOQ==","user":{"login":"codecov[bot]","id":22429695,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjI0Mjk2OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/254?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/codecov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-27T03:23:00Z","updated_at":"2021-05-27T04:05:10Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#
