We learned this lesson on PropertyDescriptor object and for that we added an additional characteristic called 'displayName'.  What I'm suggesting is we do the same for Relationship.\r\n\r\nBy adding a 'displayName' we can allow developers to change/tweak that over time whereas the 'name' cannot change once it is put out in a release unless the change is made during a major release cycle and even then we should try to minimize the frequency since it can make porting flows harder.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is the 'name' is an important part of how we establish the persistent knowledge of a connection between two components.  If you look in the flow.xml.gz of a flow with a connection you'll see the 'relationship' and in it is the name of the source processors relationship used in that connection.  So, changing the 'name' breaks old flows.  We can instead add 'displayName' and now that value is what will show up in the UI but is not what is used for underlying persistence.

The error bulletin seems a bit terse:\r\n> ConvertExcelToCSVProcessor[id=43426b41-015a-1000-b06e-3a9be79162d1] Package should contain a content type part [M1.13]\r\n* Blank Sheet - Succeeds, one empty flowfile to 'success' and the original to 'original'.  No Errors.  Seems correct to me.\r\n* Empty Workbook - I wasn't able to create an empty workbook manually in Excel.  \r\n* Unmatched Sheet Names - Covered by testNonExistantSpecifiedSheetName, seems correct to me.\r\n* Diverse Content - I tried a number of bizarre things Excel lets you put in spreadsheets -- images, tables, pivot tables, formulas, hidden sheets, etc.  Where appropriate, the processor returned content (cells in tables and pivot tables, last computed formula value), but did not run into errors.  Images were ignored.\r\n* CSV-Breaking Content - The processor does not escape text to enforce a CSV structure.  Sheets containing multiline text in a cell, cells with commas, etc. resulted in improperly formed CSV files.  I do not object, I understand that's a significant scope increase.\r\n\r\nI recommend that you do the following:\r\n\r\n1. Clearly document that the processor only supports .xlsx and NOT .xls files.  I know you've already answered questions about this on the dev list, so somebody's going to try it.\r\n2. For the .xls case, would it be possible to catch the `org.apache.poi.openxml4j.exceptions.InvalidFormatException`, repackage that with a helpful error message suggesting that only well-formed XLSX files are accepted, and route to failure?\r\n3. Document that the processor does not escape invalid CSV content.\r\n4.

Two things on the latest code:\r\n\r\n1. Did you try an .xls file?  There is a problem when the flowfile attribute is added in the catch block on line ~195.  The NiFi framework throws an exception of it's own, because we can't do `session.putAttribute` inside an InputStreamCallback for the same flowfile:\r\n\r\n> java.lang.IllegalStateException: StandardFlowFileRecord[uuid=be192381-9475-4c6d-a6ca-43735e5df271,claim=StandardContentClaim [resourceClaim=StandardResourceClaim[id=1489713904793-1, container=default, section=1], offset=0, length=26112],offset=0,name=./conf/test-xls.xls,size=26112] already in use for an active callback or InputStream created by ProcessSession.read(FlowFile) has not been closed\r\n\r\nSomething similar happens with the session.putAttribute on ~209.  As a result of these exceptions, the session is rolled back and the flowfile is returned to the input queue.  I think we can throw an exception, though.  So if we caught and rethrew with a different error message, it should work out.\r\n\r\n2. In the failure case, we're routing the flowfile to both 'failure' and 'original'.  I didn't realize it earlier, but I now believe this to be unusual in NiFi.  Most processors treat failure as an exclusive route, and 'original' as part of the successful happy path.  SplitAvro, SplitJson, SplitText, and UnpackContent were some examples I looked at.  I doubt that's written in stone.  What do you think?\r\n\r\nI made a [sample code fork](https://github.com/jvwing/nifi/commit/2ccf5dec2dcd707c5963716dfb3fbf7813c460ea) with a unit test for .xls and a suggested approach to solving the IllegalStateExceptions, and the failure routing.  I did not get the logging to cooperate the way I think it should, but we're not too far off.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/287266694/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/287349906","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1599#issuecomment-287349906","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1599","id":287349906,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NzM0OTkwNg==","user":{"login":"scottyaslan","id":6797571,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3OTc1NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6797571?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottyaslan","html_url":"https://github.com/scottyaslan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottyaslan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottyaslan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottyaslan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottyaslan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottyaslan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottyaslan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottyaslan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottyaslan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottyaslan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-17T13:12:29Z","updated_at":"2017-03-17T13:12:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Reviewing...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/287349906/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/287391549","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1599#issuecomment-287391549","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1599","id":287391549,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NzM5MTU0OQ==","user":{"login":"scottyaslan","id":6797571,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3OTc1NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6797571?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottyaslan","html_url":"https://github.com/scottyaslan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottyaslan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottyaslan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottyaslan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottyaslan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottyaslan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottyaslan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottyaslan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottyaslan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottyaslan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-17T15:47:41Z","updated_at":"2017-03-17T15:47:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @mcgilman this has been merged to master.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/287391549/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/287417405","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1585#issuecomment-287417405","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1585","id":287417405,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NzQxNzQwNQ==","user":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-17T17:20:20Z","updated_at":"2017-03-17T17:20:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bbende I created a 3-node cluster. I added MyProcessor v2.0 to the flow. I then shut down node 3, removed the nifi-example-processors-nar-2.0.nar file from the lib/ directory and removed conf/flow.xml.gz. I then restarted Node 3. It fails to startup because the cluster flow cannot be inherited, due to the node not having v2.0 of the Processor. This, I think, is the expected behavior. However, it fails with the following error message in the logs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2017-03-17 13:14:58,602 ERROR [main] o.a.nifi.controller.StandardFlowService Failed to load flow from cluster due to: org.apache.nifi.controller.UninheritableFlowException: Failed to connect node to cluster because local flow is different than cluster flow.\r\norg.apache.nifi.controller.UninheritableFlowException: Failed to connect node to cluster because local flow is different than cluster flow.\r\n\tat org.apache.nifi.controller.StandardFlowService.loadFromConnectionResponse(StandardFlowService.java:921) ~[nifi-framework-core-1.2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:1.2.0-SNAPSHOT]\r\n\tat org.apache.nifi.controller.StandardFlowService.load(StandardFlowService.java:513) ~[nifi-framework-core-1.2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:1.2.0-SNAPSHOT]\r\n\tat org.apache.nifi.web.server.JettyServer.start(JettyServer.java:780) [nifi-jetty-1.2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:1.2.0-SNAPSHOT]\r\n\tat org.apache.nifi.NiFi.<init>(NiFi.java:162) [nifi-runtime-1.2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:1.2.0-SNAPSHOT]\r\n\tat org.apache.nifi.NiFi.main(NiFi.java:269) [nifi-runtime-1.2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:1.2.0-SNAPSHOT]\r\nCaused by: org.apache.nifi.controller.UninheritableFlowException: org.apache.nifi.processors.example.MyProcessor from org.apache.nifi:nifi-example-processors-nar:2.0 is not known to this NiFi instance.\r\n\tat org.apache.nifi.controller.StandardFlowSynchronizer.checkBundleCompatibility(StandardFlowSynchronizer.java:431) ~[nifi-framework-core-1.2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:1.2.0-SNAPSHOT]\r\n\tat org.apache.nifi.controller.StandardFlowSynchronizer.sync(StandardFlowSynchronizer.java:246) ~[nifi-framework-core-1.2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:1.2.0-SNAPSHOT]\r\n\tat org.apache.nifi.controller.FlowController.synchronize(FlowController.java:1535) ~[nifi-framework-core-1.2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:1.2.0-SNAPSHOT]\r\n\tat org.apache.nifi.persistence.StandardXMLFlowConfigurationDAO.load(StandardXMLFlowConfigurationDAO.java:83) ~[nifi-framework-core-1.2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:1.2.0-SNAPSHOT]\r\n\tat org.apache.nifi.controller.StandardFlowService.loadFromBytes(StandardFlowService.java:707) ~[nifi-framework-core-1.2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:1.2.0-SNAPSHOT]\r\n\tat org.apache.nifi.controller.StandardFlowService.loadFromConnectionResponse(StandardFlowService.java:896) ~[nifi-framework-core-1.2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:1.2.0-SNAPSHOT]\r\n\t... 4 common frames omitted\r\nCaused by: java.lang.IllegalStateException: org.apache.nifi.processors.example.MyProcessor from org.apache.nifi:nifi-example-processors-nar:2.0 is not known to this NiFi instance.\r\n\tat org.apache.nifi.util.BundleUtils.findCompatibleBundle(BundleUtils.java:54) ~[nifi-framework-core-1.2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:1.2.0-SNAPSHOT]\r\n\tat org.apache.nifi.util.BundleUtils.getBundle(BundleUtils.java:88) ~[nifi-framework-core-1.2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:1.2.0-SNAPSHOT]\r\n\tat org.apache.nifi.controller.StandardFlowSynchronizer.checkBundleCompatibility(StandardFlowSynchronizer.java:429) ~[nifi-framework-core-1.2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:1.2.0-SNAPSHOT]\r\n\t... 9 common frames omitted\r\n```\r\n\r\nI find this error message confusing. It used to make sense when the local flow as different than the cluster flow and that was the only way we could get into this situation. However, it now is caused by failing to create the necessary Processor. We should use a different error message.\r\n\r\nEither we could throw a different Exception (perhaps something that extends UninheritableFlowException?) and provide a different error message, or we should make the message more generic, such as: \"Unable to update local flow to match the cluster's flow\" instead of \"Local flow is different from cluster flow,\" given that the local flow was empty and therefore should try to inherit the cluster flow.\r\n\r\nDoes that make sense?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/287417405/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/287419473","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/929#issuecomment-287419473","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/929","id":287419473,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NzQxOTQ3Mw==","user":{"login":"jvwing","id":3151078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTEwNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3151078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing","html_url":"https://github.com/jvwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-17T17:28:03Z","updated_at":"2017-03-17T17:28:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jdye64, it looks good!

@bbende, my pleasure!\r\n\r\nThanks for the quick response.\r\n\r\nThe intention was to use the Get for another processor I am writing which just needs single row lookups (didn't at first realise that FetchHBaseRow was also doing single row lookups). \r\n\r\nI had assumed that a Get would be more efficient than a Scan for fetching single rows.\r\n \r\nHowever, upon further reading it seems that the HBase client API uses a Scan implementation for Gets as well. https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/5-4-x/topics/admin_hbase_scanning.html\r\n\r\nThere are some stack overflow questions regarding Get performance being poorer than Scan, especially when using a key prefix in the scan as opposed to a full rowkey.\r\nhttps://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-get-and-scan-in-HBase\r\n\r\nIt's a little unclear what scenarios cause this performance difference, or whether one approach is more performant in general eg. when the rowkey is a full rowkey as in our case. \r\n\r\nIn summary, seeing as the HBase client API uses a Scanner under the hood when doing a Get, there should be no real benefit to having a Get added to the code (at least not without doing some practical benchmarks). \r\n\r\nI'll use the Scan for my processor instead since it already has the functionality I need. Will add the processor as a separate PR.\r\n\r\nCan I close this PR, or does that need to be done on your side?\r\n\r\nAlso, I see that the automated checks have failed (looks like other components' tests). Is this something I should worry about for my next PR?
