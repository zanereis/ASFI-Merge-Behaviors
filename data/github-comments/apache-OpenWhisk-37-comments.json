We don't have an operation that does an update only if the entity exists. So either you will need to make an API change or fix it in the CLI to do the check (does it exist) before update. Anytime you have to check before you create you're prone to a race and this is an anti-pattern to avoid.\n\nMy point is, regardless of how you implement it, the common case and the deploy scripts we've seen use `update` not create. So if all those scripts end up doing `update -f` and there are very few cases of `update` with the force, there's no good reason to add the f.\n\nWhat is this change motivated by. Do we have feedback that suggests the current semantics have become or are confusing?\n\nTo your use case, and if the same two users did this, what's the gain?\n\n```\nwsk update -f processMyChecks processMyChecks.js\n\nSome later or another person or script\n\nwsk update -f processmyChecks processMyChecks.js\n```\n\nOne alternate consideration is to return a different code for created vs update (200 vs 201). This is perhaps least disruptive and allows the CLI or a client to report \"created\" vs \"updated\" message.\nThen it doesn't matter if they update or create, `-f` or lack there of, you know exactly what happened.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/243912258/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/243914118","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/1176#issuecomment-243914118","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1176","id":243914118,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MzkxNDExOA==","user":{"login":"csantanapr","id":1094878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTQ4Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1094878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr","html_url":"https://github.com/csantanapr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-31T21:51:55Z","updated_at":"2016-08-31T21:51:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"OK so your saying that you agree with me that having a POST to create an action is good thing?\n\nSo your saying we go with something like this?:\nGET, PUT, DELETE on this URIs\nhttps://{BASE URL}/api/v2/namespaces/{namespace}/actions/[{packageName}/]{actionName}\nhttps://{BASE URL}/api/v2/namespaces/{namespace}/triggers/{triggerName}\n\nPOST on this URIs\nhttps://{BASE URL}/api/v2/namespaces/{namespace}/actions\nbody will have action entity to create including packagename it belongs to\nhttps://{BASE URL}/api/v2/namespaces/{namespace}/triggers\nbody will have trigger entity to create\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/243914118/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/243914490","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/1176#issuecomment-243914490","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1176","id":243914490,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MzkxNDQ5MA==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-31T21:53:32Z","updated_at":"2017-01-24T03:08:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> OK so your saying that you agree with me that having a POST to create an action is good thing?\r\n\r\nI neither agreed or disagreed.

/api/v2/namespaces/ns/actions/a/activations`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/243914490/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/243916030","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/1171#issuecomment-243916030","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1171","id":243916030,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MzkxNjAzMA==","user":{"login":"csantanapr","id":1094878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTQ4Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1094878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr","html_url":"https://github.com/csantanapr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-31T21:59:47Z","updated_at":"2016-08-31T21:59:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"That's
