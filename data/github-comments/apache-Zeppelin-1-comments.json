another fun example, that monitors spark worker's cpu and display them on Zeppelin, in realtime.\n\n[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](http://img.youtube.com/vi/cWuWUvWVLx4/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWuWUvWVLx4)\n\nThe code is not perfect. but you'll see the idea and capabilities of this Angular display system.\n\nHere's scala part\n\n``` scala\nimport sys.process._\n\n// get cluster cpu info using spark\ndef getClusterCpu = {\n    sc.setLocalProperty(\"spark.scheduler.pool\", \"fair\");\n    val clusterCpu = sc.parallelize(1 to 10).map{s=>\n        ((\"hostname\" !!).replace(\"\\n\", \"\"), \"mpstat 1 1\" !!)\n    }.map{ s =>\n        (s._1, ((100.0 - s._2.split(\"\\n\")(3).split(\"\\\\s+\")(10).toDouble)*100).toInt.toDouble / 100)\n    }.reduceByKey((a,b) => scala.math.max(a,b)).collect.sortWith(_._1 < _._1)\n    z.angularBind(\"cpuUsage\", clusterCpu)\n}\n\n// start monitoring. once a second.\nval t = new java.util.Timer()\nval task = new java.util.TimerTask {\n  def run() = getClusterCpu\n}\nt.schedule(task, 1000L, 1000L)\n```\n\nhere's angular part\n\n``` html\n%angular\nCluster CPU Usage\n\n<table class=\"table\">\n    <tr>\n        <th style=\"width:200px\">Host</th>\n        <th style=\"width:100px\">Cpu</th>\n        <th></th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr ng-repeat=\"info in cpuUsage\">\n        <td>{{info._1}}</td>\n        <td>{{info._2}}</td>\n        <td>\n            <div
