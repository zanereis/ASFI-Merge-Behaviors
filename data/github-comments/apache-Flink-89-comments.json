think this is in okay shape, quite an improvement over the current version.\n\nThere are some things I suggest to re-examine:\n\nMethod `commitOffsets()` in \"KlinkKafkaConsumer08:397\" misses `@Override` annotation.\n\nThe \"TODO: maybe add a check again here if we are still running.\" seems worth doing\n\nIn many places, you do `if (!closableQueue.addIfOpen(...)) { error }`. Simply use the `add()`´ method, which errors if not open. Also (LegacyFetcher:120): There can never be an IllegalStateException while initially loading in the constructor.\n\nI do not see the use of the list `deadBrokerThreads` in the legacy fetcher. Unless I am overlooking something, I would remove it (simplify the code). Since they will eventually shut down anyways, I think you need not sync on them when leaving the `run()` method of the legacy fetcher.\n\nThe check whether a fetcher thread is alive should probably be `thread.getNewPartitionsQueue().isOpen()`, rather than `thread.isAlive()`. That is the flag that is atomically changed and checked with the adding of partitions. \n\nThe fetcher's main thread always blocks 5 seconds before it can notice that the broker threads shut down.\nI am wondering if we can make that more snappy, by waking the main thread up when a fetcher thread terminates (by adding a marker element to the queue).\n\nMethod `findLeaderForPartitions(...)` in the legacy fetcher also fails hard once it cannot find the leader for a partition (no retries). Is that intended?\n\nThe code uses everywhere `Integer.valueOf()`, creating a boxed integer, and then unboxes it. `Integer.parseInt(...)` is the preferrable choice (almost always, I would completely drop using `Integer.valueOf()` in any place).\n\nThis loop (in `findLeaderForPartitions(...)`) is either to nifty for me to comprehend, or bogus:\n\n``` java\nList<KafkaTopicPartitionLeader> topicPartitionWithLeaderList = infoFetcher.getPartitions();\nList<FetchPartition> partitionsToAssignInternal = new ArrayList<>(partitionsToAssign);\n\nMap<Node, List<FetchPartition>> leaderToPartitions = new HashMap<>();\n\nfor(KafkaTopicPartitionLeader partitionLeader: topicPartitionWithLeaderList) {\n    if (partitionsToAssignInternal.size() == 0) {\n        // we are done: all partitions are assigned\n        break;\n    }\n    Iterator<FetchPartition> fpIter = partitionsToAssignInternal.iterator();\n    while (fpIter.hasNext()) {\n        FetchPartition fp = fpIter.next();\n        if (fp.topic.equals(partitionLeader.getTopicPartition().getTopic())\n                && fp.partition == partitionLeader.getTopicPartition().getPartition()) {\n\n            // we found the leader for one of the fetch partitions\n            Node leader = partitionLeader.getLeader();\n            List<FetchPartition> partitionsOfLeader = leaderToPartitions.get(leader);\n            if (partitionsOfLeader == null) {\n                partitionsOfLeader = new ArrayList<>();\n                leaderToPartitions.put(leader, partitionsOfLeader);\n            }\n            partitionsOfLeader.add(fp);\n            fpIter.remove();\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nDoes this do anything different than the version below? (The internal iteration always finds the\nexact same element at the first position and breaks).\n\n``` java\nList<KafkaTopicPartitionLeader> topicPartitionWithLeaderList = infoFetcher.getPartitions();\nMap<Node, List<FetchPartition>> leaderToPartitions = new HashMap<>();\n\nfor (KafkaTopicPartitionLeader partitionLeader: topicPartitionWithLeaderList) {\n    Node leader = partitionLeader.getLeader();\n    List<FetchPartition> partitionsOfLeader = leaderToPartitions.get(leader);\n    if (partitionsOfLeader == null) {\n        partitionsOfLeader = new ArrayList<>();\n        leaderToPartitions.put(leader, partitionsOfLeader);\n    }\n    partitionsOfLeader.add(fp);\n}\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/185903144/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/185903526","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1623#issuecomment-185903526","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1623","id":185903526,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4NTkwMzUyNg==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-18T20:33:00Z","updated_at":"2016-02-18T20:33:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I have made a few changes on top of this, which address some of the comments above.

I am not sure if other StreamTasks will do this in the future, so it might be better to just put the logic in the StreamIterationTail instead of adding a new abstraction\n- I think the RecordPusher and UpstreamLogger embedded operators on the head and tail tasks are not really necessary and just add additional complexity to debugging and understanding the code. The Upstream logger only makes checkpointing \"easier\" for the implementer but we probably want to do some custom logic there anyways. So I would probably just overwrite the checkpointStatesInternal method directly.\n\nI agree that we definitely need to spill the buffered records to disk or use managed memory for this. This can be similar to the BarrierBuffer logic.

I just wanted to get the code look less messy in the tail part but you are right.\n\nAbout the operators, the `RecordPusher` was already there (even though it was not initialised correctly). I just added the `UpstreamLogger` because I wanted it to follow the operator lifecycle. I think the way it is we do not need to override the `checkpointStatesInternal` to do the changes we discuss. We just need to change the operator callback method and this could also be more robust to changes in the StreamTask and operator interfaces and default behavior, just my personal view but I see your point too.\n\nI agree with the spill buffer logic. I am only confused a bit with the output stream thing (the other part of the problem), is there something already I can use? I haven't check recent changes. How does this work if we use in-memory backend for example? The blob with all the messages will be anyway packaged and sent within the stateHandle to the job manager in a single message (potentially being over the limits), even if we use a stream API, or?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/186147597/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/186149376","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1674#issuecomment-186149376","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1674","id":186149376,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4NjE0OTM3Ng==","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-19T10:13:23Z","updated_at":"2016-02-19T10:13:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This PR adds \"\" around the flink path within python bat files, so that paths containing spaces are treated as a single argument.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/186149376/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/186174994","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1668#issuecomment-186174994","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1668","id":186174994,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4NjE3NDk5NA==","user":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-19T11:11:44Z","updated_at":"2016-02-19T11:11:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Great idea @senorcarbone.

This has the disadvantage that the workload here is not characteristic of a reduce (eg. no processRecordWithReduce calls, because the other hash tables don't have that).\n\nI have also benchmarked using my game theory stuff (which originally prompted me to start working on this), and the hash-based combiner was faster here as well.\n\n> Did you check the combine rate (input / output ratio) compared to the sort-based strategy?\n\nI didn't measure it directly, but `ReducePerformance` shows the difference nicely when the number of input elements is large enough that the sort-based strategy has to emit often, but the number of different keys is small enough that the hash-based strategy can fit all the keys in memory. In this case, the speedup of the final reduce phase is striking.\n\n> Have you checked heap memory consumption / GC activity compared to the sort-based strategy?\n\nI haven't actually checked it, but it should be the same or better as with the sort-based strategy:\n- enabled object reuse: no allocations at all\n- disabled object reuse: one allocation per input element, and one allocation per reduce step\n\nThe sort-based strategy might additionally have allocations inside maybe the sorter and/or MergeIterator.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/186244959/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/186247461","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1517#issuecomment-186247461","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1517","id":186247461,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4NjI0NzQ2MQ==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-19T15:00:26Z","updated_at":"2016-02-19T15:00:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Great, thanks for the detailed response @ggevay!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/186247461/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/186257996","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1517#issuecomment-186257996","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1517","id":186257996,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4NjI1Nzk5Ng==","user":{"login":"aalexandrov","id":1071946,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzE5NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1071946?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aalexandrov","html_url":"https://github.com/aalexandrov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aalexandrov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aalexandrov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aalexandrov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aalexandrov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aalexandrov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aalexandrov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aalexandrov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aalexandrov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aalexandrov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-19T15:21:57Z","updated_at":"2016-02-19T15:21:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@fhueske We will propose three experiments based on your suggestions in a Google Doc on Monday.

That's why the number of nodemanagers in the test is 0.\nThe issue is occurring after you change, because the test execution order changed. Before your change, the `testQueryCluster()` test was executed after other tests, so the NM's were always registered.\nSince you removed many tests from the FIFOITCase, the `testQueryCluster()` is the first test to be executed. Apparently, the test setup is not waiting until all NM's are connected.\n\nI think you can solve the issue using the `waitForNodeManagersToConnect` from the MiniYARNCluster.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/186835009/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/186948795","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1685#issuecomment-186948795","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1685","id":186948795,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4Njk0ODc5NQ==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-22T00:08:45Z","updated_at":"2016-02-22T00:08:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It is pretty crucial that different hash functions are used for the partitioning across machines, and the internal partitioning of data structures.
