There, a socket leaks on `listen` failure; here, a memory allocation leaks on deserialization failure.\r\n\r\nI suppose, repro of this issue involves running a `c_glib` client on intentionally malformed buffers & under a leak detector (asan/valgrind). Then, the leak would trigger whenever we expect to read an i32 but get something else instead.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/822393437/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/823735239","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/2369#issuecomment-823735239","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2369","id":823735239,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyMzczNTIzOQ==","user":{"login":"unfetteredwind","id":34181886,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTgxODg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34181886?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/unfetteredwind","html_url":"https://github.com/unfetteredwind","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unfetteredwind/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unfetteredwind/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unfetteredwind/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unfetteredwind/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unfetteredwind/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unfetteredwind/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unfetteredwind/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unfetteredwind/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unfetteredwind/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-21T02:40:32Z","updated_at":"2021-04-21T06:50:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"OK, first of all, let me briefly explain why this judgment condition is written.\r\n（Number is the number of lines of code）\r\nThere are two writing conditions:\r\n1、The value of allocate is true.\r\n2、The type is not TYPE_STRING type in the base type.\r\n\r\n1、In this document, the function generate_deserialize_field is invoked in the following four locations:\r\nstruct:generate_struct_reader                      allocate：default value: false    3579  3664\r\nmap: generate_deserialize_map_element   allocate：default value: true      4271  4294\r\nset: generate_deserialize_set_element        allocate：default value: true      4305  4316\r\nlist: generate_deserialize_list_element        allocate：default value: true      4325  4338\r\n\r\nCheck the function invoked by each. If the value of allocate is false, new is not triggered(declare_local_variable is not invoked in the struct ). In this case, free is not required.\r\nWhen the value of allocate is true, the declare_local_variable function is invoked in the map, set, and list to trigger new. In this case, you need to perform the free operation when an exception occurs.\r\nSo that's one of my judgements.\r\n\r\n2、And going back to this function : generate_deserialize_list_element.\r\nThe judgment condition is in the base_type branch. 4020\r\nAs you can see, if the type is TYPE_STRING, there is no leakage problem in this part,。Because he did special treatment., 4023-4028.\r\nFor the remaining types, if they enter the exception branch after new, memory leakage will be triggered.\r\nThat's another criterion for me. If the condition is met, it needs to be processed.\r\n\r\nThat's why I chose the condition. And, perhaps the judgment is not rigorous enough, and my intention is to raise this issue so that people can see this issue and push this issue to be resolved.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs for the test..., it's working on it.And....I'm lazy.

The implementor of what? If you are putting long lived tasks on the thread pool without using the [TaskCreationOptions.LongRunning](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.taskcreationoptions?view=net-5.0) option, you are at risk of deadlocking (at least for 1 second) everything in the system, even completely unrelated code.

The problem is that since the thread pool is a shared resource with complex logic that depends on the hardware being run on, the expression of this type of bug is often very intermittent, and usually far away from the actual bug. It took me forever to debug that problem. Since then I am always on the lookout for improper long lived tasks on the thread pool.\r\n\r\nI found this bug in some test cases that we have of our own code. In this case I am standing up mocks of the in and out of process sides of a Thrift communication channel all inside the test and testing the channel itself. It was intermittently failing and when I investigated I found these long lived threads sitting in the thread pool. \r\n\r\nNote that in this case, my tests are not useful to you because they are testing our code a layer up. While I was debugging, I also found that NamedPipeClientStream.ConnectAsync is also implemented incorrectly (I have not submitted that issue to Microsoft yet). Putting a workaround in for that one (I use the synchronous Connect() call on a TaskCreationOption.LongLived task) actually mostly (but not totally) fixes this specific unit test problem for us. Note that there is no way to put a workaround for TThreadPoolAsyncServer in (short of creating a cut-n-paste clone of it) because it is a private internal method.\r\n\r\nI openly admit that I have no proof that these long lived tasks are causing active problems. I still submit that if they don't now, they will someday in a subtle and difficult to debug way.\r\n\r\nThe way I would expect to be able to reproduce this would be to start a TThreadPoolAsyncServer and then start many connections to it without closing the previous connections. My expectations would be that the first few would be fast, but when you exhausted the thread pool, the next connection would take 1 second to connect while the thread pool deadlocks.\r\n\r\nNote that the exact behavior will likely depend on whether you are using .NET Framework or .NET Core, the specific version you are using, and the hardware you are running on. It is entirely possible that Microsoft has or will change the nature of how the thread pool deals with this situation. All the more reason in my mind to watch out for this situation.\r\n\r\nSorry for the diatribe! Thank you for the thoughtful and timely dialog, as well as for the great project! We use Thrift for a lot of things these days and it has been a valuable tool to us!\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/848701698/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/849102171","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/2397#issuecomment-849102171","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2397","id":849102171,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0OTEwMjE3MQ==","user":{"login":"Jens-G","id":5834733,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MzQ3MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5834733?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G","html_url":"https://github.com/Jens-G","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-26T20:39:56Z","updated_at":"2021-05-26T20:39:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":">

Would it be possible to add also a small test directly to `lib/cpp/test/ToStringTest.cpp` to see more transparently what case will fail?

I'll add unit tests for integer and float string formatting to ToStringTest.cpp and remove the changes to JSONProtocolTest. The integer string formatting test will set the global locale to \"en_US.UTF-8\" which uses comma for a thousands separator. The float string formatting test will set the global locale to \"de_DE.UTF-8\" which uses a decimal comma -- not a decimal point.\r\n\r\nBefore changes to TToString.h, the tests would fail like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# ./UnitTests \r\nRunning 57 test cases...\r\n/thrift/src/lib/cpp/test/ToStringTest.cpp(52): error: in \"ToStringTest/locale_en_US_int_to_string\": check to_string(1000000) == \"1000000\" has failed [1,000,000 != 1000000]\r\n/thrift/src/lib/cpp/test/ToStringTest.cpp(62): error: in \"ToStringTest/locale_de_DE_float_to_string\": check to_string(1.2) == \"1.2\" has failed [1,2 != 1.2]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'll have the changes ready soon.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/855263748/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/855287712","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/2393#issuecomment-855287712","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2393","id":855287712,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg1NTI4NzcxMg==","user":{"login":"bforbis","id":16994570,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTk0NTcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16994570?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bforbis","html_url":"https://github.com/bforbis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bforbis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bforbis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bforbis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bforbis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bforbis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bforbis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bforbis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bforbis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bforbis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-05T19:52:26Z","updated_at":"2021-06-05T19:52:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"If a user is not tolerant to data loss, they should not use UDP.

But I still worry that from the point of view of an unsuspecting Thrift user, its not easily understandable that Thrift will allow UDP and then silently drop lost messages. Furthermore, for non-void-messages its very likely that this will mess with protocols and servers. It seems to me this hands the user a running chainsaw without any guidance. But I may not see all the details here, since AFAICS the change is \"only\" in the client? Maybe its less harmful there because users are not able to create a corresponding UDP server(?).

There are a couple of places where we now call a function with multiple boolean args, and without keyword args it can get confusing.\r\n\r\nI have no strong opinions here: the approach here just avoids code duplication by branching of with the `is_sync`. I personally have no problem with these arguments, but happy to change it to whatever makes sense to you.\r\n\r\n> Finally, I've never used async-trait. Do you know if the Thrift generator requires any features that are not supported by it?\r\n\r\n`async-trait` is just a macro to enable traits with `async`. We have been using it in Apache Arrow (e.g. [here](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/blob/master/datafusion/src/physical_plan/hash_aggregate.rs#L194)) to declare a trait that is `async`. `integer-encoding`, which we depend on, also uses it when compiled with `futures_async`. The declarations do not need this, only the lib declaring and implementing the trait.\r\n\r\n> Next, I would like to see a rough cut of how TInputStreamProtocol is implemented, just to see how everything fits together.\r\n\r\nI agree. I have been working on it today. I just pushed a draft to this. Still not compiling, but it gives a general idea; it is just mundane code of the equivalent `async` of the `TCompactInputProtocol`.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/890551249/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/890729544","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/2426#issuecomment-890729544","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2426","id":890729544,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAS9U841F3RI","user":{"login":"jorgecarleitao","id":2772607,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NzI2MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2772607?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgecarleitao","html_url":"https://github.com/jorgecarleitao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgecarleitao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgecarleitao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgecarleitao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgecarleitao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgecarleitao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgecarleitao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgecarleitao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgecarleitao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgecarleitao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-02T05:33:11Z","updated_at":"2021-08-02T05:33:11Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Small update: with this version of the code, I was able to generate new code for `parquet.thrift` from `parquet-format-rs` (https://github.com/sunchao/parquet-format-rs/pull/19) and use it to write an `async` version of parquet metadata (https://github.com/jorgecarleitao/parquet2/pull/33) that reads a large metadata file correctly.
