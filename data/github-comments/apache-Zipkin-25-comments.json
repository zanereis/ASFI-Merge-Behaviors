But from the system architecture view this service X looks like a proxy of sort, e.g. it can have 50 services on the left and 200 services on the right, and the only path from left to right is through X. So the diagram looks like {50}->X->{200}, but gives no indication of the actual dependencies between left and right side. Maybe one of 50 depends only on one of 200, we can't tell from the diagram. But the trace data does tell that, so I'd like to have a way to reflect it in the diagram.\n\nNote that this problem has a second level of depth - showing dependencies by span/operation name, which is also something my users are very interested in. It would be nice to come up with a richer aggregation data model than just (parent, child, count), so that it would allow answering these questions.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/175790409/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/175973656","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/915#issuecomment-175973656","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/915","id":175973656,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3NTk3MzY1Ng==","user":{"login":"yurishkuro","id":3523016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MjMwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3523016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro","html_url":"https://github.com/yurishkuro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-28T04:48:57Z","updated_at":"2016-01-28T04:48:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Replaced

Probably the UI could be written far cleaner than our current one. An advantage is that the next field of interest about tracers has a far more coherent place to go. The other advantage mentioned is that this leaves the current dependency model clear to actually complete! ie adding latency data, something mentioned multiple times.\n\nhttp://blog.codinghorror.com/rule-of-three/\n\nIf a reporting project is made, and no-one besides you use it, we'll know that it shouldn't have gone upstream anyway. We wouldn't have displaced effort from people who aren't interested. If on the other hand, it becomes popular, we've a new microservice of value in zipkin as opposed to an increasingly hard to maintain monolith. IOTW, interested people have a more nimble way to contribute to tracer inventory/adoption projects.\n\nRegardless, I'd encourage you to brief others, for example at our workshop next week.

Basically, by leaving these unset, we can see if skewed, annotation-derived duration is set properly. The test impl should be the same.\n\nNext, add a skew test where a parent's duration is set explicitly, but children are derived from annotations. One way to do this is to take the spans from the above test and make them a child of a span with an explicitly-set duration. In this case the parent will have its timestamp shifted, so that children happen after it, but the parent's duration is left alone. The child tree should be affected the same as the existing test.\n\n@yurishkuro does ^^ capture your
