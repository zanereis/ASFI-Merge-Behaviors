this is unlike the current setup in travis where a monolithic docker environment has to be setup\r\n4. if that goes smoothly, have a final cross test runner that combines all the built cross test runners \r\n\r\n\r\n[1]: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/storing-workflow-data-as-artifacts","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/1111859568/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/1111979325","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/2592#issuecomment-1111979325","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2592","id":1111979325,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAS9U85CR3U9","user":{"login":"jimexist","id":622789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMjc4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/622789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimexist","html_url":"https://github.com/jimexist","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimexist/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimexist/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimexist/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimexist/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimexist/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimexist/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimexist/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimexist/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimexist/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-28T09:37:09Z","updated_at":"2022-04-28T09:43:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@ctubbsii thanks for the review -

The spotless check is a standalone step already included into gradle build - but you can also run it on its own. It does the check on Java lib code that's checked into git.\r\n\r\nI understand that spotlessCheck is included into the gradle build. However, I'm suggesting that for it to be useful as a CI check, it needs to be run on its own, outside the normal gradle build.\r\n\r\nIn development, we want: `gradle build` to execute `spotlessApply` so it formats all the code. After that, it can run `spotlessCheck` to make sure everything was formatted, but it's kind of redundant, because everything should have been formatted by the previous `spotlessApply` step. We don't expect the build to fail based on formatting here. But, the developer should check in any changed files, to include in their pull request.\r\n\r\nIn the pull request CI checks, we want something different. It is not sufficient to simply run `gradle build`, which will run `spotlessApply` to format all the source code. We actually want to run `spotlessCheck` **without** running `spotlessApply`, because we're not trying to *format* the source code during CI... we're trying to *detect unformatted* source code.\r\n\r\nSo, we need to run `spotlessCheck` on its own, without running `gradle build`, because we want to avoid running `spotlessApply` before running `spotlessCheck`. If we do `gradle build`, the check will always pass, and we will fail to detect that some files in the PR weren't formatted.\r\n\r\nImagine that there is unformatted code in a PR. We want a CI check to ensure code in PRs are formatted already, so we don't merge unformatted code.\r\n\r\nAs I understand it, `gradle build` will, among other things, run `spotlessApply`, then `spotlessCheck`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/1117740256/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/1117743035","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/2581#issuecomment-1117743035","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2581","id":1117743035,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAS9U85Cn2e7","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-04T19:31:23Z","updated_at":"2022-05-04T19:31:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"As an example, Accumulo [does this](https://github.com/apache/accumulo/blob/main/.github/workflows/maven.yaml#L59) to verify the format during CI.

The resulting libthrift.jar could still be used with Java 8, if the appropriate `--release 8` flag is placed on `javac`. In my experience, JDK 11 is even better than JDK 8 at enforcing the Java 8 language rules and results in byte code that more reliably runs on a variety of Java 8 runtimes anyway. But, I don't know if you'd get resistance to this, because some people don't like building and testing with a different JDK version than the Java runtime the jar is targeting. I don't know how to set `--release 8` for Gradle, but it can't be too hard.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/1120352415/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/1120353270","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/2601#issuecomment-1120353270","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2601","id":1120353270,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAS9U85Cxzv2","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-08T05:27:23Z","updated_at":"2022-05-08T05:27:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Looking at this changeset makes me just hate Gradle so much.

Nowadays i don't use `mvn` as much but it's a more mature and popular choice so i'm okay with learning and using either one. currently libthrift uses gradle so be it (unless someone wants to make a chance).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/1120355087/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/1120359643","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/2600#issuecomment-1120359643","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2600","id":1120359643,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAS9U85Cx1Tb","user":{"login":"jimexist","id":622789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMjc4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/622789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimexist","html_url":"https://github.com/jimexist","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimexist/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimexist/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimexist/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimexist/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimexist/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimexist/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimexist/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimexist/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimexist/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-08T06:31:07Z","updated_at":"2022-05-08T06:31:07Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> @Jimexist Are the cross tests running during the CI checks?
