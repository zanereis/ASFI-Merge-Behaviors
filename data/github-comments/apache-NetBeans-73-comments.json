Look at the method variant that does not take IOContainer - it does: `Lookups.fixed((Object[]) actions)`. So each individual Action will be in the Lookup. Now, if I provide an IOContainer, suddenly the array of actions becomes a Lookup element on its own.

Cutting betas is cheap, cutting voting candidates, pulling votes or pushing updates is not.  In 11.1 we (well, I!) let in a seemingly innocuous change between final beta and voting candidate that triggered a blocker, forced the vote to be pulled and put the release back weeks.  We decided in review of that to do releases off final beta, and have done (more or less) since.  Better to add a few days IMO, but it's @lkishalmi choice of headache! :smile:","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/720368462/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/720556439","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2504#issuecomment-720556439","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/2504","id":720556439,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyMDU1NjQzOQ==","user":{"login":"lkishalmi","id":1381701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODE3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1381701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi","html_url":"https://github.com/lkishalmi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-02T15:51:59Z","updated_at":"2020-11-02T15:51:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Well, probably it would skew the release schedule a bit, but we can still make it between 15th-30th of November.\r\nSo.

Don't let me dissuade you from opening a PR to replace this one.I don't particularly like adding another call to modelToView, since it's typically not needed.
