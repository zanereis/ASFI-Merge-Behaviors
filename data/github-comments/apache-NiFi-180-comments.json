I agree the old processors should be slowly phased out. For now they got the deprecation notation so hopefully new adopters will naturally move to the new processor. There is one thing I wanted to highlight. For the new processor the Proxy Configuration Service property / functionality is not yet available. As that needs to be addressed on gRPC level it will be covered as part of a follow up ticket: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10707 Not sure whether it affects your use case or not just wanted to highlight it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1296235669/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1296281586","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6500#issuecomment-1296281586","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6500","id":1296281586,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5NQ6_y","user":{"login":"hboutemy","id":237462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNzQ2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/237462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hboutemy","html_url":"https://github.com/hboutemy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hboutemy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hboutemy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hboutemy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hboutemy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hboutemy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hboutemy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hboutemy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hboutemy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hboutemy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-30T15:10:35Z","updated_at":"2022-10-30T15:10:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"waiting for ANTLR3 upstream solution seems to take ages: I don't think it's worth waiting for it","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1296281586/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1296282966","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6217#issuecomment-1296282966","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6217","id":1296282966,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5NQ7VW","user":{"login":"markobean","id":16822728,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODIyNzI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16822728?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean","html_url":"https://github.com/markobean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-30T15:17:53Z","updated_at":"2022-10-30T15:17:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@markap14 There is no issue with Input/Output ports. The flow.json.gz is accurate which is where the Input/Output ports become relevant. Rather it is the `FlowInfo` which contains incorrect information. This object contains ports by reference, but not their ID values directly; the references and their ID values are correct. However, `FlowInfo` does contain the UUID for the root process group. This is the value which is in error and needs to be corrected; this PR corrects this error. The only change required is the root group UUID referenced when creating the `FlowInfo` object.\r\n\r\nThe PR was rebased to current main, but otherwise remains the same. No additional changes are required.\r\n\r\nAs noted in the original JIRA ticket description, you can observe the error by starting NiFi with an existing flow.json.gz (and flow.xml.gz) but without authorizations.xml or users.xml. Also, the managed-authorizer should be used, not single-user-authorizer, and an Initial Admin User should be specified. You will see that the root group UUID found in the Component Access Policies in the resulting authorizations.xml is incorrect. It references the root group `identifier` rather than `instanceIdentifier`. Repeat the above process with this PR and you will note the `instanceIdentifier` is correctly used in the policies (authorizations.xml.)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1296282966/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1297443481","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6590#issuecomment-1297443481","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6590","id":1297443481,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5NVWqZ","user":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-31T17:40:22Z","updated_at":"2022-10-31T17:40:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 LGTM, thanks for the improvement!

The test leverages the `TemporaryKeyStoreBuilder` to generate a key pair and certificate, and then encodes the private key and certificate for use with the container.

This refactoring allowed for the removal of the certificate and key files from the repository.\r\n\r\nI pushed the commit to the pull request branch, so let me know what you think and I can proceed to merge if it looks good.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1301585579/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1302100779","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6617#issuecomment-1302100779","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6617","id":1302100779,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5NnHsr","user":{"login":"mr1716","id":9115680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMTU2ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9115680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr1716","html_url":"https://github.com/mr1716","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr1716/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr1716/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr1716/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr1716/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr1716/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr1716/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr1716/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr1716/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr1716/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-03T13:15:12Z","updated_at":"2022-11-03T13:15:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"All of the workflows did work and run successfully the other day ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1302100779/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1302101249","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6565#issuecomment-1302101249","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6565","id":1302101249,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5NnH0B","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-03T13:15:37Z","updated_at":"2022-11-03T13:15:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mark-bathori Given that the changes to make this work would require a more generalized change to bootstrap.conf, I think it is best to close this pull request and create a new one that describes the more generalized nature of the change.
