在外面没什么问题。参考：https://juejin.cn/post/7269962653795270671\r\n\r\n这个回复好像容易误导人。\r\n\r\n看下 jdk 的官方文档建议吧，应该来说是最“正宗的”，https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/locks/ReentrantLock.html\r\n\r\n> It is recommended practice to *always* immediately follow a call to `lock` with a `try` block, most typically in a before/after construction such as:\r\n>\r\n> ```java\r\n>  class X {\r\n>    private final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();\r\n>    // ...\r\n> \r\n>    public void m() {\r\n>      lock.lock();  // block until condition holds\r\n>      try {\r\n>        // ... method body\r\n>      } finally {\r\n>        lock.unlock()\r\n>      }\r\n>    }\r\n>  }\r\n> ```\r\n\r\n\r\n另外，上面掘金文章结尾有几句话：\r\n\r\n> 1. 最好是把 lock.lock() 加锁方法写到 try 外面，是一种规范，而不是强制。\r\n>\r\n> 2. 如果你非要写到 try 里面，那么写到 try 语句块的第一行，或者 lock 加锁方法前面不会存在可能出现异常的代码。\r\n>\r\n> 3. 最后，如果你代码中加锁放到了 try 语句里，麻烦参考第 1 点\r\n\r\n\r\n严格来讲这几个结论，可能在 ReentrantLock 这个实现下是没问题的，但 lock 是接口，会有任意实现多种实现。\r\n\r\n在不同的实现下，lock.lock()  方法抛出异常是很有可能的，因此不能放在 try 当中。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1835681345/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1835936073","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/7560#issuecomment-1835936073","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/7560","id":1835936073,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl85tbilJ","user":{"login":"echooymxq","id":19860963,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5ODYwOTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19860963?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/echooymxq","html_url":"https://github.com/echooymxq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echooymxq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echooymxq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echooymxq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echooymxq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echooymxq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echooymxq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echooymxq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echooymxq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echooymxq/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-01T11:30:18Z","updated_at":"2023-12-01T11:30:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@dingshuangxi888
