The new `InvokeHTTPTest` attempts to cover a wide array of use cases, which also helped expose some of the limited use and dead code lines in `InvokeHTTP`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/797705226/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/798891126","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4886#issuecomment-798891126","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4886","id":798891126,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5ODg5MTEyNg==","user":{"login":"gutosantos82","id":13214892,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjE0ODky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13214892?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gutosantos82","html_url":"https://github.com/gutosantos82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gutosantos82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gutosantos82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gutosantos82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gutosantos82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gutosantos82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gutosantos82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gutosantos82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gutosantos82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gutosantos82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-14T11:30:58Z","updated_at":"2021-03-14T11:30:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Ok, I will do that.

This limitation is due to a server-side change that converts datetime to datetime2 differently, resulting in non-equitable values. The workaround to this issue is to either change datetime columns to datetime2(3), use String instead of java.sql.Timestamp, or change database compatibility level to 120 or below.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/802979812/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/803097523","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4917#issuecomment-803097523","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4917","id":803097523,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwMzA5NzUyMw==","user":{"login":"adenes","id":1275646,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzU2NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1275646?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adenes","html_url":"https://github.com/adenes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adenes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adenes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adenes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adenes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adenes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adenes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adenes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adenes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adenes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-19T20:17:05Z","updated_at":"2021-03-19T20:17:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jfrazee , you can reproduce it with a simple flow (GFF -> PutAzureBlobStorage), just first you need to upload a blob to an Azure storage container and set its access tier to archive.

How about where the consumers are reading from different shards and/or multiple consumers from the same shard?)\r\n\r\nSo I thought a record writer may be a sensible extension (fully agree it would be good to include from a nifi perspective) once there's more understanding of how people use the processor and how it works with different kinesis setups (so far I've only really tested it with simple streams)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/804689864/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/804938745","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4922#issuecomment-804938745","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4922","id":804938745,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwNDkzODc0NQ==","user":{"login":"joewitt","id":3057465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTc0NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3057465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt","html_url":"https://github.com/joewitt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-23T14:16:20Z","updated_at":"2021-03-23T14:16:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"merged

The new command class is located under `nifi-flow-encryptor`.  The existing `ConfigEncryptionTool` continues to work, but contained a lot of the same code, so this change provided an opportunity to refactor `ConfigEncryptionTool` to leverage the `PropertyEncryptor` interface.  This simplifies `ConfigEncryptionTool` and also removes code that diverged from the standard property encryption approach.\r\n\r\nWith these changes, the Admin Guide now includes a new section describing the `set-sensitive-properties-key` command.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/805814048/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/805816849","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4872#issuecomment-805816849","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4872","id":805816849,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwNTgxNjg0OQ==","user":{"login":"pvillard31","id":11541012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTQxMDEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11541012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31","html_url":"https://github.com/pvillard31","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-24T13:24:17Z","updated_at":"2021-03-24T13:24:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merged to main, thanks @diarworld ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/805816849/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/805824784","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4854#issuecomment-805824784","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4854","id":805824784,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwNTgyNDc4NA==","user":{"login":"ChrisSamo632","id":12159006,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTU5MDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12159006?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632","html_url":"https://github.com/ChrisSamo632","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-24T13:32:13Z","updated_at":"2021-03-24T13:32:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Thanks for making the adjustments @eaolson.

This is cool, can't wait to give it a try. \r\n\r\nOne quick observation - I would remove the `minifi-c2` submodule. That was a PoC based on https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MINIFI/C2+Design.

But will this mean that C2 wont be compatible anymore? Or can we still use it, so our minifies can pull their config from it? Or should or can we switch to nifi registry for that? Or does it simply mean that the minifi-cpp c2 server will be compatible to minifi-java? (Sry if this is not the right place to discuss this?)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/806401588/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/806425096","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4931#issuecomment-806425096","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4931","id":806425096,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwNjQyNTA5Ng==","user":{"login":"timeabarna","id":38653567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NjUzNTY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38653567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timeabarna","html_url":"https://github.com/timeabarna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timeabarna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timeabarna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timeabarna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timeabarna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timeabarna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timeabarna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timeabarna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timeabarna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timeabarna/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-25T07:23:15Z","updated_at":"2021-03-25T07:23:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@phrocker
