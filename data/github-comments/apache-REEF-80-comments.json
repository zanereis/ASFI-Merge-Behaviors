I will check why this thread still has an old name and fix it in subsequent PRs.\r\n\r\nAlso, @yunseong could you please tell me if your HelloREEF client had exited normally or it just hung after dumping the thread info? A non-daemon thread in `WAITING` mode would prevent Java process from exiting, so if your process exits fine, then everything is OK, and the thread showing up in the logs is just a timing issue that we can safely ignore.\r\n\r\nIf your process blocks on exit because of this thread - we have an issue. Please check that [REEF-1715](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/REEF-1715) is **not** merged in to make sure that the client is not waiting on the Driver - it looks like that `pool-1-thread-1` thread is actually waiting for the Driver process to finish.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/274992155/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/275002080","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/1234#issuecomment-275002080","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/1234","id":275002080,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NTAwMjA4MA==","user":{"login":"jwang98052","id":5666504,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NjY1MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5666504?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052","html_url":"https://github.com/jwang98052","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-25T02:26:12Z","updated_at":"2017-01-25T02:26:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM.
