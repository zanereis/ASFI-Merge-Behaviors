I think we can have major.minor.bugfix release versioning scheme and release more frequently when relatively major bugfixes are merged. I oppose using branches as releases because I feel it is very unmanageable if we want to back port bug fixes to every release branches. If there is no agreement on git workflows, we could probably try to follow some well established workflows such as [git flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) for a random example.\n\nTravis CI could have [dedicated building servers](https://travis-ci.com/plans). The plan is quite expensive ($129/month). But github has an [education pack](https://education.github.com/pack), and private builds for Travis CI are available as long as you are a student. I have never tried to set that up. Maybe we could try to utilize that instead of setting up our own CI server (unless setting up is very easy and still integrate well with github).\n\nIn any case, I support splitting test cases into fast unit-test and deeper tests. I think it is a good idea to add coverage statistics. Currently MXNet.jl is using [codecov](https://codecov.io/github/dmlc/MXNet.jl?branch=master). I guess this might be a bit tricky as the main repo is actually a host of a lot of front-ends.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/167370488/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/167370863","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/1074#issuecomment-167370863","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1074","id":167370863,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NzM3MDg2Mw==","user":{"login":"mli","id":421857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTg1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/421857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli","html_url":"https://github.com/mli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-26T23:12:12Z","updated_at":"2015-12-26T23:12:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@piiswrong

Compiling on Windows is a little annoying and I am afraid there is something you have to do manually. I list them blow:\n\n(1) create the folder `R-package/inst/libs/x64`. We only support 64-bit operating system now, so you need `x64` foler;\n\n(2) put dll files in `R-package/inst/libs/x64`;\n\n(3) create the folder `R-package/inst/include` and copy all header files into it. Just like what we do in https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/master/Makefile#L190-L192\n\n(4) `R CMD INSTALL R-package`\n\nBTW, you can find the pre-built package from [mxnet_0.5.zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dmlc/drat/gh-pages/bin/windows/contrib/3.2/mxnet_0.5.zip).
