Tathagata,\n\nI've tried to merge branch-1.0 with master but the conflict in\nReceiverInputDStream is \"this file was created in both branches\".

Am I right?\nAlso, could you take a look at my comment and advise which way it is better\nto fix this bug: tolerate \"invalid\" time or prevent calling DStream at\ninvalid times?\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/961#issuecomment-45125185\n\nThanks,\nVadim.\n\nOn Wed, Jun 4, 2014 at 6:03 PM, Tathagata Das notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> Thanks for the patch.

removed a unit test introduced in this PR which was failing in the most recent build. That test was ensuring SQLConf is always a subset of HiveConf. However, the keys `datanucleus.cache.collections.lazy`, `datanucleus.cache.collections`, `hive.metastore.partition.name.whitelist.pattern` are executed by Hive in various queries in the test suite, and hence are not picked up by SQLConf but reside in HiveConf.\n\nOne proposal is to just remove the contract that SQLConf is a subset of HiveConf, and instead merely enforce any SET by `sql()/hql()` and `sqlConf.set()` will be picked by HiveConf, in the case where a HiveContext is in use. This sounds reasonable to me as we don't have an immediate use case where a subset relation is depended upon on (or do we?).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/45279750/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/45281468","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/986#issuecomment-45281468","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/986","id":45281468,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MjgxNDY4","user":{"login":"AmplabJenkins","id":4031291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzEyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4031291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/AmplabJenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-06-05T22:07:58Z","updated_at":"2014-06-05T22:07:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"

So pendingTasksForExecutor is empty and all tasks are added to pendingTasksForHost. If at the beginning no node is available, then all tasks will also be added to pendingTasksWithNoPrefs (as @mateiz suggested). When we look for a task to launch, we always try to launch a PROCESS_LOCAL one first. Suppose now an executor comes in and it can satisfy some tasks in pendingTasksForHost. However, since we always try with PROCESS_LOCAL first, pendingTasksForHost will simply be skipped in TaskSetManager.findTask. And we end up picking a task in pendingTasksWithNoPrefs. You can see there's an if statement when trying to pick tasks from pendingTasksForHost and pendingTasksForRack, to test if we currently allow such \"low\" locality level. But tasks in pendingTasksForExecutor and pendingTasksWithNoPrefs are picked unconditionally since they are considered have the highest level.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/45293719/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/45293739","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/931#issuecomment-45293739","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/931","id":45293739,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MjkzNzM5","user":{"login":"mateiz","id":228859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODg1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz","html_url":"https://github.com/mateiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-06-06T01:15:55Z","updated_at":"2014-06-06T01:15:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks
