We need to use `hbase.client.scanner.max.result.size` before setting up `PhoenixTestDriver`\r\n2. Set `phoenix.scanning.result.post.dummy.process` to a class that can process region moves after dummy is received by client (depending on how aggressive tests are, we need custom logic here)\r\n3. Set `phoenix.scanning.result.post.valid.process` for some tests\r\n4. Set `phoenix.server.page.size.ms` to 0ms to generate frequent timeouts at server side\r\n5. Depending on tests, we also need to move regions after specific num of `rs#next` calls\r\n6. Region move logic has to be very specific: only move regions of tables that are really going to be used by queries e.g. data table and index table for the given query. If we move all regions (including hbase and phoenix system tables), tests take 5x more time than what they do with the current setup.\r\n7. Spin up 2 regionservers because all tests use 1 regionserver by default and we cannot move regions in that setup.\r\n8. Until we catch any flappers, it would be good to keep this category of region move tests as `NeedsOwnMiniClusterTest`.\r\n\r\nIn fact, initially i was able to reduce the patch size from ~19k to < 15k by adding `ParallelStatsDisabledWithRegionMovesIT`, which is now being extended by several tests. The most important is point#6, which requires tests to add table names to a Set, which can be used by custom logic to move only those table regions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/1895124476/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/1895149696","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/phoenix/pull/1745#issuecomment-1895149696","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/1745","id":1895149696,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAThmSs5w9bCA","user":{"login":"stoty","id":304757,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDc1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/304757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty","html_url":"https://github.com/stoty","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-17T06:54:53Z","updated_at":"2024-01-17T06:54:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This is a pom only change, and #1736 doesn't touch the poms, so I wouldn't expect them to confict in any way.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/1895149696/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
