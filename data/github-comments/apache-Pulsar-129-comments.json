Since all unix timestamp are in UTC time does it make sense to have timezone information for publish_time especially since it is set by the system?  In presto, for a timestamp field, by default it displays the time in the local timezone anyways\r\n\r\n2. The user can set event_time, and from my understanding, users can offset the unix timestamp in UTC time by certain number of hours to correspond to a particular timezone.  Is this a best practice?
