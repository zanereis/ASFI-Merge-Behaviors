In my earlier review, I had overlooked that the kill involved forking the JVM; your new approach of having the daemon kill the workers is much better.\n\nThe test case looks good, too (clever use of Python's `for ... else` construct; I hadn't seen that before).\n\nIn https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1680, there was some discussion over whether to use SIGKILL vs. SIGHUP to kill the Python workers.  Now that I've had more time to think about it, I think SIGKILL is a fine approach:\n- Spark doesn't provide any documented, user-facing mechanisms for allowing tasks to perform cleanup work when they're cancelled.\n- The only case where it might make sense to have a cleanup mechanism is when performing side-effects, such as writing to an external database.  A machine could immediately lose power or otherwise fail without executing the cleanup mechanism, so users already have to guard against the effects of immediate failures (e.g. by using transactions).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51005638/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51005954","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1643#issuecomment-51005954","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1643","id":51005954,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMDA1OTU0","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-03T22:53:51Z","updated_at":"2014-08-03T22:53:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've merged this into `master` and `branch-1.1`.

uses [FileLock](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/nio/channels/FileLock.html) as its locking mechanism.  According to those docs (emphasis mine),\n\n> Whether or not a lock actually prevents another program from accessing the content of the locked region is system-dependent and therefore unspecified. The native file-locking facilities of some systems are merely advisory, meaning that programs must cooperatively observe a known locking protocol in order to guarantee data integrity. On other systems native file locks are mandatory, meaning that if one program locks a region of a file then other programs are actually prevented from accessing that region in a way that would violate the lock. On yet other systems, whether native file locks are advisory or mandatory is configurable on a per-file basis. **To ensure consistent and correct behavior across platforms, it is strongly recommended that the locks provided by this API be used as if they were advisory locks.**\n\nCan you comment on whether this approach is safe if we're using advisory locks, and maybe add that comment to the source code?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51018958/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51019363","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1462#issuecomment-51019363","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1462","id":51019363,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMDE5MzYz","user":{"login":"li-zhihui","id":3699905,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2OTk5MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3699905?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/li-zhihui","html_url":"https://github.com/li-zhihui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/li-zhihui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/li-zhihui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/li-zhihui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/li-zhihui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/li-zhihui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/li-zhihui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/li-zhihui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/li-zhihui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/li-zhihui/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-04T05:41:09Z","updated_at":"2014-08-04T05:41:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@pwendell removing support for this in standalone mode is just keeping totalExpectedExecutors zero.\nhttps://github.com/li-zhihui/spark/commit/fa5af15d982e86c880302e8b9ef38645944be13f\n\nI think it just make user use spark more easily.
