We have used two ways to proof:\r\n\r\n1. we have used parfor for multiplication of two 10000*10000 matrices in our simple test case and there is a significant reduction in runtime in case of two GPUs as compared to single GPU.\r\n\r\n2. We can clearly see in the java debug environment that in the parallel computation in the `executeLocalParFor` function of the `ParForProgramBlock` class, the `LocalParWorker` and its `Thread` corresponding to the two GPUs take on several computation `Task`s. For a test example, in a matrix math calculation by using `parfor`, the RTX4070 calculated 8 Tasks while the GTX1080 calculated 4. \r\n\r\nWe'll show about these in our test code.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/2228035321/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/2231948344","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/2050#issuecomment-2231948344","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/2050","id":2231948344,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArxUbc6FCNQ4","user":{"login":"KexingLi22","id":116363920,"node_id":"U_kgDOBu-SkA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116363920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KexingLi22","html_url":"https://github.com/KexingLi22","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KexingLi22/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KexingLi22/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KexingLi22/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KexingLi22/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KexingLi22/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KexingLi22/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KexingLi22/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KexingLi22/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KexingLi22/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-16T22:52:53Z","updated_at":"2024-07-16T22:52:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> > > > > Thanks, @WDRshadow, for initiating the project.

The numbers do not look very good. Train just once and write the model in the disk. In a separate script, read the model and infer the test instances within a parfor loop. Here is an example script [1]. You can even use a randomly initialized model, as we are not measuring the accuracy here. I expect at least a 2x improvement. Vary the test size (i.e., the number of iterations of parfor loop) from 10k to 100k.\r\n\r\nFirst focus on the development, unit testing and experiments. The logger can be delayed. Instead, extend the ParForStatistics class to report the number of GPUs used by the parfor and other relavent details. These will be printed when -stats is passed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/2231958815/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/2235905047","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/2050#issuecomment-2235905047","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/2050","id":2235905047,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArxUbc6FRTQX","user":{"login":"codecov[bot]","id":22429695,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjI0Mjk2OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/254?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/codecov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-18T08:16:04Z","updated_at":"2025-01-12T11:22:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## [Codecov](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/systemds/pull/2050?dropdown=coverage&src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=apache) Report\nAttention: Patch coverage is `12.50000%` with `7 lines` in your changes missing coverage.

In that case, try one of the two options: (1) write the model to disk, create separate dml scripts for inference where you read the model and immediately start the parfor loop. You can find plenty of read, write examples in the test scripts and the reproducibility scripts I shared with you. (2) use time() method before and after the parfor and report only the inference time. You can find an example of using time() here: https://github.com/damslab/reproducibility/blob/master/vldb2022-UPLIFT-p2528/FTBench/systemds/T1.dml\r\n\r\nFor either option, make sure the intermediates are already materialized before the loop starts. SystemDS compiler sometime delays operations till used. You can print the sum of a matrix to force materialization.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/2241079330/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/2241614037","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/2036#issuecomment-2241614037","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/2036","id":2241614037,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArxUbc6FnFDV","user":{"login":"phaniarnab","id":4302361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDIzNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4302361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab","html_url":"https://github.com/phaniarnab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-21T13:35:37Z","updated_at":"2024-07-21T13:35:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you, @Mayaryin, @ingunnaf for your contribution.\r\nWith some changes, I see a 2x speedup for real use cases, which is very good.\r\nI will not merge this PR immediately, as the changes are in the critical path of transformencode and may impact other running projects.

This should be due to under-optimisation of `LocalParWorker` or GPU memory management. We have observed the following reasons that may affect multi-GPU optimisation:\r\n1. Multiple GPUs share a storage space with synchronisation locks. For example, `_gpuObjects` stores the caches in each `Task` for the GPUs to read and record the data. Each time a GPU reads that data it will cause blocking.\r\n2. The `TaskPartitioner` design may not be optimal. When the number of `Task` allocations is low in the case of a large amount of data but a small number of `threads`, the single Task calculation will be larger. However, there may be errors in GPU computation, in which case the `Task` needs to be recomputed, consuming more time if that error `Task` is \"big\". This can be mitigated by improving `Task` allocation.\r\n3. The speedup will improve greatly when multiple GPUs are equally divided into the `Task` and there are no errors in the computation. However, I have observed that in the case of dual graphics cards, one card may execute more `Tasks` than the other.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/2241790721/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/2242175862","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/2050#issuecomment-2242175862","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/2050","id":2242175862,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArxUbc6FpON2","user":{"login":"phaniarnab","id":4302361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDIzNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4302361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab","html_url":"https://github.com/phaniarnab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-22T06:20:59Z","updated_at":"2024-07-22T06:20:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Okay.

Whether your team is comparing changes in a pull request or reviewing a single commit, Codecov will improve the code review workflow and quality.\r\n\r\n## Code coverage done right.®\r\n\r\n1. Upload coverage reports from your CI builds.\r\n2. Codecov merges all builds and languages into one beautiful coherent report.\r\n3. Get commit statuses, pull request comments and coverage overlay via our browser extension.\r\n\r\nWhen Codecov merges your uploads it keeps track of the CI provider (inc. build details) and user specified context, e.g. `#unittest` ~ `#smoketest` or `#oldcode` ~ `#newcode`. You can track the `#unittest` coverage independently of other groups.
