Thank you!\r\n\r\nAs for why there are so many spans: based on discussions with @stevehu and other Light4J developers, we would like to see detailed information on the `LightHttpHandler`s that are involved during the life of a HTTP request in a Light4J project, in addition to the tracing from the Undertow plugin. Do you foresee any problems with the number of spans being created? My screenshots are from using an example Light4J project so I think this will be the typical amount.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/526859971/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/526874062","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/3388#issuecomment-526874062","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/3388","id":526874062,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNjg3NDA2Mg==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-01T00:00:43Z","updated_at":"2019-09-01T00:00:43Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"/run ci","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/526874062/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/526874923","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/3323#issuecomment-526874923","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/3323","id":526874923,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNjg3NDkyMw==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-01T00:16:18Z","updated_at":"2019-09-01T00:16:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"SkyWalking is not just a tracing project, it is an APM, so the data you generated related to metrics and topology.
