In addition, we decided upon having a get-and-delete functionality for transient BLOBs (as planned by a TODO item previously).\r\n\r\nThis means the following changes:\r\n- the `BlobServer` deletes transient BLOBs after they have been successfully downloaded to a BLOB cache (the client acknowledges that)\r\n- the `TransientBlobCache` and `PermanentBlobCache` differ in the functionality they provide:\r\n  - `PermanentBlobCache` uses ref-counting for cleaning up its resources\r\n  - `TransientBlobCache` imposes the user to manually delete requested BLOB files (from the cache!)\r\n  - `TransientBlobCache` allows uploading (transient) BLOBs\r\n  - `TransientBlobCache` allows non-job-related BLOBs\r\n  - both have a GET method: `#getTransientFile()` vs. `#getPermanentFile()`\r\n  - irrespective of the actual cache being used, the `BlobServer` decides whether to delete the BLOB (transient BLOBs only) or not (permanent BLOBs)\r\n  - theoretically, a permanent BLOB could also be retrieved from the `TransientBlobCache` (and the other way around if job-related) - this behaviour is not used though but basic tests exist to cover it","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/331872956/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/331873712","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4612#issuecomment-331873712","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4612","id":331873712,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMTg3MzcxMg==","user":{"login":"twalthr","id":5746567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDY1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5746567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr","html_url":"https://github.com/twalthr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-25T13:03:03Z","updated_at":"2017-09-25T13:03:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the review @fhueske.

merged this, excellent work! 👍\r\n\r\nThe Scala API has its own `OutputTag` because it allows us to use a Scala feature called context bounds. The signature of the Scala `OutputTag` is\r\n```\r\nclass OutputTag[T: TypeInformation](\r\n    id: String) extends JOutputTag[T](id, implicitly[TypeInformation[T]])\r\n```\r\nthe `T: TypeInformation` part tells the compiler to make an object of type `TypeInformation[T]` implicitly available. We use this to hook into the compiler (using a feature called Scala Macros) to generate the `TypeInformation` for `T`. You'll notice that in Java, when specifying an `OutputTag` you have to make it an anonymous inner class. This is because we can only analyse proper subclasses using the `TypeExtractor` in Java.\r\n\r\nCould you please close the PR?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/331888402/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/331890702","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4671#issuecomment-331890702","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4671","id":331890702,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMTg5MDcwMg==","user":{"login":"StefanRRichter","id":2128543,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjg1NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2128543?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter","html_url":"https://github.com/StefanRRichter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-25T14:01:56Z","updated_at":"2017-09-25T14:01:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@aljoscha Thanks for the reviews of this and PR #4639 !
