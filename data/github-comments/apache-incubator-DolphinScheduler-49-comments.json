+1，and I'm interesting in this issue, I think i can implement that issue.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion and understanding:\r\n\r\n1.Python and shell script can do anything that java script can do.\r\n2.If user familiar with Java, they also can use some simple python or shell scripts to call java jar or java class, they just need maintain the jar lib.\r\n3.It will make DS complicated before achieve the pluggable DS, it will make the DS modules will be clearer.\r\n\r\n--------------\r\n个人有一些不同理解，如下：\r\n\r\n1.Python 和 shell 脚本其实已经可以实现任何 java 脚本可以做的东西。\r\n2.如果用户对java更加熟悉，也可以使用简单的 Python 或者 shell 脚本去调用 java jar 包 或者 class 文件，只需要维护这写jar包就可以了，或者我们可以简单的实现一个前端页面，后端实现本质上还是通过shell去调用？\r\n3.个人理解如果这个诉求很多人都有的话，其实我们完全可以在将DS插件化这个issue实现之后再做这个，这样的话模块之间会更加清晰。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/644091932/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/644130883","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/1162#issuecomment-644130883","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/1162","id":644130883,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0NDEzMDg4Mw==","user":{"login":"gabrywu","id":8545796,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1NDU3OTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8545796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrywu","html_url":"https://github.com/gabrywu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrywu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrywu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrywu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrywu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrywu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrywu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrywu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrywu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrywu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-15T13:20:48Z","updated_at":"2020-06-15T13:20:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":">
