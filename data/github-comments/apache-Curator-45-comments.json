href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CURATOR-551\" title=\"Curator client always call updateServerList with original serverList value, not the ones updated by EnsembleTracker\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"CURATOR-551\"><del>CURATOR-551</del></a>).  iiuc,</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>At first FixedEnsembleProvider will have the connection string provided to Curator at start-up.  This value should also make its way into Helper.</li>\n\t<li>After connect or reconnect or the watch fires, EnsembleTracker will determine a (possibly different) connection string according to the ZK servers based on the special config node.  This is a background operation.  Once determined, this value gets put into the FixedEnsembleProvider, but is not immediately pushed into Helper.</li>\n\t<li>At a later time, say connection suspended, HandleHolder will check the FixedEnsembleProvider value against the Helper value.  If they differ, the FixedEnsembleProvider value will be returned.  (In 4.3, not 4.2.)</li>\n\t<li>Shortly after, but in a different method (ConnectionState.handleNewConnectionString)), this new value will be put back into Helper.  (So there may be a window for multiple check-fails to amass before it resolves itself, though it seems it should be small.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>Remark: ExhibitorEnsembleProvider is different from FixedEnsembleProvider for our purposes.  It ignores the value from EnsembleTracker.</p>\n\n<p>Is the value from EnsembleTracker consistent, apart from genuine changes?  The servers are in a HashMap with a key of the server ID.  There are things that could make that inconsistent, like two keys in the same bucket inserted in different orders.  In practice this seems like it would be rare, maybe even never.  (Of course, ZooKeeper could change it to an inconsistent implementation, not that there's any obvious reason to.)</p>\n\n<p>You could guard against this if you wanted.  EnsembleTracker.configToConnectionString is Curator code.  It could impose an order on the servers, <em>e.g.</em>, by interjecting a TreeMap.</p>\n\n<p>So ... absent HashMap madness, and unless values are getting reset somewere I haven't noticed ... in 4.3 there could be one glitch.  Or possibly one glitch detected more than once due to multiple threads.  But after that the value should ultimately have come from EnsembleTracker and things should clear up.</p>\n\n<p>Caveat, I do not pretend to understand this code well.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604783257/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604783808","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/curator/issues/1092#issuecomment-2604783808","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/1092","id":2604783808,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MDQ3ODM4MDg=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-05T04:28:58Z","updated_at":"2025-01-21T13:46:47Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a

Zookeeper always returns IPs (based on my testing, not 100% sure on this) in the config update calls. So, even if the user of Curator provides the full set of ZK nodes in the connection string, if they are provided as hostnames rather than IPs, then when we get a config event, this always results in an update to the connection string.</p>\n\n<p>2.) The ordering of IP addresses may not be deterministic. I haven't seen ordering issues, by <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=ryarran\" class=\"user-hover\" rel=\"ryarran\">Rhys Yarranton</a> has mentioned that he has. On the ZK side, I believe the data is stored in a map before streaming, so ordering is not guaranteed.</p>\n\n<p>So, one possible solution is to</p>\n\n<p>-Enforce ordering of IP addresses on the Curator side. I don't believe this has any effect on how connections to ZK are actually established. From memory, a host is chosen at random to connect to to try and distribute load.</p>\n\n<p>-Execute the conversion of hostnames to IP addresses and ordering them on the initial connection string provided to Curator. For the case where the specified connection string contains all configured ZK nodes, this prevents one unnecessary call to updateServerList() for the case where the client provides hostnames and ZK returns IP addresses.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604783293/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604783977","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/curator/issues/1093#issuecomment-2604783977","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/1093","id":2604783977,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MDQ3ODM5Nzc=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-18T11:22:54Z","updated_at":"2025-01-21T13:46:50Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a

I can provide a patch to avoid the NPE.</p>\n\n<p>I see 2 options:</p>\n\n<p>1.- Keep a compatible behavior, that with a single server.addr.getAddress() resolution to null the method return an empty string and therefore the connecstring will be unmodified (I can add a LOG warn statement).</p>\n\n<p>2.- Another alternative is to continue the loop till the end ignoring servers that are resolved to null...</p>\n\n<p>What do you think is

class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">official Zookeeper Docker image</a> for deploying to Docker Swarm, specifically, using \"0.0.0.0\" as the bind address.</p>\n\n<p>I have a deployment of three Zookeeper nodes in Docker Swarm, and have attempted to give them stable IPs by pinning each container to a dedicated node and using the node hostname when advertising the service:</p>\n\n<p><tt>ZOO_SERVERS: server.1=0.0.0.0:2888:3888;2181 server.2=host2:2888:3888;host2:2181 server.3=host3:2888:3888;host3:2181</tt><br/>\n{{ ZOO_SERVERS:

The addresses 10.5.x.x are the valid IP addresses for the Docker hosts.
