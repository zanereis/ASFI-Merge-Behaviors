folks. I'm on the ActiveMQ PMC and I can confirm what @jimma has said. The goal of the ActiveMQ community is to make Artemis the next major version of ActiveMQ (i.e. 6.0). \r\n\r\nI'm not clear on the entire use-case here, but if you're embedding ActiveMQ and using it internally then it should be a pretty straight-forward migration assuming you aren't making use of many ActiveMQ-specific features. Looking through @reta's PR it looks pretty much as I would expect.\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth I'm looking at helping TomEE support ActiveMQ Artemis right now based on a recent [discussion like this](https://lists.apache.org/list?dev@activemq.apache.org:lte=1M:Jakarta%20compatible%20version%20of%20ActiveMQ%20classic) on the ActiveMQ dev list, although I've been covered up with other work recently.\r\n\r\nI think the sooner projects like CXF, TomEE, etc. migrate the better position we'll _all_ be in. At the very least it will reduce pressure on ActiveMQ to duplicate work on the \"Classic\" broker that's already been done on Artemis.\r\n\r\nI'm willing to answer any questions anybody has, technical or otherwise, about CXF's potential migration to Artemis. I would volunteer to help with the coding, but @reta seems to have that in hand already.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/1067254805/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/1067260885","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cxf/pull/919#issuecomment-1067260885","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/919","id":1067260885,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQMOR84_nRvV","user":{"login":"reta","id":509855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTg1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/509855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta","html_url":"https://github.com/reta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-14T20:33:48Z","updated_at":"2022-03-14T20:33:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks a lot @jbertram, it sounds very reassuring, thank you for confirming.
