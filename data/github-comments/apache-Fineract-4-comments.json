 I think there is a little confusion over my last comment. I was completely fine with validation during disbursal and submission. All I wanted to convey was, change the method signature of \"checkForProductMixRestrictions\" and \"checkForProductMixRestrictions\" present in LoanWritePlatformServiceJpaRepositoryImpl, so that you can have a common method and call it from  \"LoanApplicationWritePlatformServiceJpaRepositoryImpl\" and \"LoanWritePlatformServiceJpaRepositoryImpl\". So that you handle all the scenarios you described previously. I believe the current change checks only during submission. If you want to check only during the submission and not during disbursal for existing loans, let me know I will approve the change.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/416833518/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/416836595","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/454#issuecomment-416836595","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/454","id":416836595,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNjgzNjU5NQ==","user":{"login":"MexinaD","id":8160209,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNjAyMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8160209?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MexinaD","html_url":"https://github.com/MexinaD","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MexinaD/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MexinaD/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MexinaD/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MexinaD/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MexinaD/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MexinaD/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MexinaD/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MexinaD/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MexinaD/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-29T06:13:16Z","updated_at":"2018-08-29T06:13:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hello
