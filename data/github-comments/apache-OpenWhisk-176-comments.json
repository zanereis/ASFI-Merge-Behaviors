I assume, that the installation is complete as you also mentioned it in issue #5023.\r\n\r\nCan you please let me know if there would be any issues with this installation process? I know that this is not the best solution to go about it, but I am not familiar with Gradle, thus have to resort to such means. Let me know if you can point to some better solution.

So when there are 5 stale activations, we need to provision 4 more containers to handle 5mins-running activations.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if the action runs for only 10 ms, if we provision 4 more containers, then the initial container will handle all 5 activations because 4 container provisioning will take some time. So this is the over-provisioning case.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second case implies there are not enough containers.\r\n\r\n```\r\n          case (Running, Some(duration)) if staleActivationNum > 0 =>\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince the duration is available, some activations are already invoked.\r\nSo there are already some containers and they actively handle incoming requests, but some activations have waited in the queue for more than the threshold(100ms).

One more thing, what does availableMsg here means? Does that means the activation Message numbers in MemoryQueue, including the message in TimeSeriesActivationEntry queue and the message waiting to hand over to ActivationService?\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/openwhisk/blob/af11418df942e8d2cdc4c4ce933645fa723e9e45/core/scheduler/src/main/scala/org/apache/openwhisk/core/scheduler/queue/SchedulingDecisionMaker.scala#L44\r\nAt first, I thought it only means the activation message numbers in TimeSeriesActivationEntry queue, like the term R*inqueue* in your paper. But I was confused that why is *currentMsg+incoming.get()* here..? If it is activation message numbers,it should only be currentMsg, so after that, I looked forward to where can I get the incoming info in MemoryQueue.scala.\r\nAnd I found that there is only one place the *incoming* will change——in the method handleActivationMessage https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/blob/af11418df942e8d2cdc4c4ce933645fa723e9e45/core/scheduler/src/main/scala/org/apache/openwhisk/core/scheduler/queue/MemoryQueue.scala#L914. If memoryQueue get the ActivationMessage, the incoming will increase, and it will first check whether if there were uncompleted request in requestBuffer, otherwise it will put the activation message to the TimeSeriesActivationEntry queue, both will then decrease the incoming.\r\nSo the availableMsg means the concept I mentioned at the beginning, I don't know whether if I am right, please correct me. \r\n\r\nSo I have a new question: why always compare the num and availableMsg to calculate the actualNum in most cases? I probably know why in the latter two situations(have Some(duration)), but don't know for this case:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/openwhisk/blob/af11418df942e8d2cdc4c4ce933645fa723e9e45/core/scheduler/src/main/scala/org/apache/openwhisk/core/scheduler/queue/SchedulingDecisionMaker.scala#L107","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/950332126/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/950438674","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/5118#issuecomment-950438674","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/5118","id":950438674,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAxoOzc44posS","user":{"login":"style95","id":3447251,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDcyNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3447251?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95","html_url":"https://github.com/style95","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-25T01:03:18Z","updated_at":"2021-10-25T01:04:17Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@JesseStutler \r\nYes, you are correct.\r\nWhen adding more containers, we need to consider activations waiting in the queue and incoming activations which couldn't be stored in the queue yet.

I worked with the Adobe I/O support team and got the root cause of the issue, which appears to be a few different things as follows:\r\n\r\ndcfcd0681d804dafbcd0681d80edafb6 : (Pod eviction) [Pod ephemeral local storage usage exceeds the total limit of containers 500Mi.]\r\n \r\n4163948263e84268a3948263e8b2682e : (the node process may have crashed, or the network was slow for some time)\r\n \r\n50f29217fa9a4d6db29217fa9a7d6d54 : (Concurrent activation failed and container was terminated) [Activation f27f18a7347146f0bf18a7347116f003 - {\"error\":\"An error has occurred: Cannot load module '<path to our main.js>': ReferenceError: config is not defined\"} ]\r\n\r\nTo give a little context, all our application does it to make JS calls (using the Axios library), to a commerce system.  The commerce system returns data, and we then transform it into what our CMS expects, and return it to the CMS.  So the application effectively works as a middleware/ESL layer between a CMS and Commerce system in order to integrate them in a way that makes them feel like a single website. That's all the code does in every possible instance.\r\n\r\nSo I think this is probably not related to anything that's core to OpenWhisk, but more that we're not handling some specific cases that I'm not really sure how to handle.  To answer your question, we're not intentional reusing any containers.  I'm new to this, so maybe I'm doing that by accident?  Is there some way I can force each activation to use a new container or something?\r\n\r\nSince we saw this error, I've at least added a timeout to our Axios calls (30s), with the hopes that at least we won't have any long running calls after that.  I'm just not sure exactly what might be happening and what I can do to prevent it.  My understanding here is that each activation is independent of all other activations, and so I'm a little confused as to where to even start.  That being said, I'm trying to escalate the issue with Adobe to try and get some support from them at least.  If you have any suggestions though, I'd love to hear them!   For the pod storage, I'm really confused.  My code is transient, and after each activation, the container should be destroyed and space reclaimed.  Is there anything specific I need to do in order to get storage to clean up?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/954793598/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/954959563","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/5168#issuecomment-954959563","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/5168","id":954959563,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAxoOzc4464bL","user":{"login":"paul42","id":278262,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3ODI2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/278262?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul42","html_url":"https://github.com/paul42","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul42/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul42/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul42/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul42/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul42/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul42/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul42/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul42/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul42/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-29T18:27:02Z","updated_at":"2021-10-29T18:27:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"as an aside building a manual cluster with kubeadm didn't fix either:\r\n\r\n1.

In general, you can run openwhisk by doing\r\n\r\n    sudo java -jar ./bin/openwhisk-standalone.jar\r\n\r\nAnd in our case, we need to supply the `standalone.conf` file through the `-c` parameter to the command above.
