Can you please share when is the 0.36 release expected.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/598257344/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/598259815","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/9288#issuecomment-598259815","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/9288","id":598259815,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5ODI1OTgxNQ==","user":{"login":"willbarrett","id":1779034,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzkwMzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1779034?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willbarrett","html_url":"https://github.com/willbarrett","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willbarrett/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willbarrett/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willbarrett/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willbarrett/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willbarrett/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willbarrett/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willbarrett/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willbarrett/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willbarrett/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-12T15:43:59Z","updated_at":"2020-03-12T15:43:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@sahiljain001 hopefully in the next couple of weeks, but it depends on the Apache release process and what issues are discovered along the way.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/598259815/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/598269364","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/8699#issuecomment-598269364","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/8699","id":598269364,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5ODI2OTM2NA==","user":{"login":"altef","id":4316295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTYyOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4316295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/altef","html_url":"https://github.com/altef","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/altef/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/altef/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/altef/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/altef/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/altef/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/altef/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/altef/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/altef/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/altef/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-12T16:01:43Z","updated_at":"2020-03-12T16:01:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @AaronCH5,  I'm not completely certain what you're asking, but one difference is that in this pull request (which has been merged) instead of specifying a column and a value you specify a clause that will be added to the query.   So in your example above where you specify the column name `avg_circulate_duration` and the value `toB`, you would instead just write something like `avg_circulate_duration='toB'`.  \r\n\r\nSince you can write whatever you want in there, this allows you to go pretty deep down the filter hole.  You can use multiple columns, or reference other tables as necessary.  For example, it would allow you to move complex permissions into its own table should you so desire:\r\n\r\n> `avg_circulate_duration IN (SELECT allowed_avg_circulate_duration FROM custompermissions WHERE user_id='{{current_user_id()}}')`\r\n\r\nThe actual processing code where the filter clause gets added to the query is in https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/master/superset/connectors/sqla/models.py#L867\r\n\r\nThe cache key code in viz.py you referenced (https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/master/superset/viz.py#L394) adds the row level security IDs to the cache key, in order to differentiate cached query results for queries that would otherwise be the same but for different RLS rules.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/598269364/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/598278330","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/9130#issuecomment-598278330","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/9130","id":598278330,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5ODI3ODMzMA==","user":{"login":"elaragon","id":3785819,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3ODU4MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3785819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elaragon","html_url":"https://github.com/elaragon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elaragon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elaragon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elaragon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elaragon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elaragon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elaragon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elaragon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elaragon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elaragon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-12T16:19:16Z","updated_at":"2020-03-12T16:19:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I am experiencing the exact same problem, surprisingly, I just found that box plots refresh when:\r\n- zooming in/out in the web browser.\r\n- clicking on \"Explore Chart\" and then returning to the dashboard\r\n\r\nI hope this helps to fix this bug soon 🙏","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/598278330/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/598329757","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/9287#issuecomment-598329757","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/9287","id":598329757,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5ODMyOTc1Nw==","user":{"login":"betodealmeida","id":1534870,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzQ4NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1534870?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida","html_url":"https://github.com/betodealmeida","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-12T17:42:37Z","updated_at":"2020-03-12T17:42:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Yeah, @villebro is right.\r\n\r\nI think the problem here is that we might have leftover queries in the `queries` table that are associated with tabs that were deleted.

You can see all the places charts depend on the datasource here: https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui-plugins/search?p=1&q=datasource&unscoped_q=datasource\r\n\r\nFrom what I can see, the datasource is used primarily for two reasons:\r\n1. To add special number formatting to a metric as in: https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui-plugins/blob/17a5f64312326e708a81bab4a45578fd181b2e1e/packages/superset-ui-legacy-preset-chart-big-number/src/BigNumber/transformProps.js#L88-L92\r\n2. To format the name of a metric differently as in: https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui-plugins/blob/be604e24fd9c7ac715e448673c56bed40c5344ff/packages/superset-ui-legacy-plugin-chart-partition/src/transformProps.js#L43\r\n\r\nAll of the instances i've tested haven't broken any charts entirely, so I think the main source of regressions would be formatting regressions (e.g. rendering 0.03 instead of 3% or \"metric_name_not_pretty\" instead of \"Pretty Metric Name\"). I think that we could merge this now and deploy internally, being ready to revert fast if needed or patch with any minor issues that show up. Alternatively I could put this behind a feature flag and only enable it in our deployment to start if we thought that was safer.

Having given this some additional thought, I think the right place to tackle this is in `kylinpy`. If your case is representative of a typical Kylin installation, the connector should not be adding quotes that are not supported by the dialect. Therefore we should probably defer this discussion to the [kylinpy GitHub page](https://github.com/Kyligence/kylinpy). If there is any fine tuning that needs to take place in Superset, we can definitely accommodate for that in the Kylin spec in Superset. Also, feel free to tag me in issues/PRs in the kylinpy repo if you feel I can be of assistance.\r\n\r\nI'll close this WIP PR for now., but once the necessary changes have been made to `kylinpy`, we can open up a new PR if there are any outstanding changes that need to be made to the Kylin spec.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/599258414/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/599294813","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/8699#issuecomment-599294813","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/8699","id":599294813,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5OTI5NDgxMw==","user":{"login":"zpi1223","id":24953071,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTUzMDcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24953071?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpi1223","html_url":"https://github.com/zpi1223","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpi1223/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpi1223/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpi1223/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpi1223/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpi1223/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpi1223/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpi1223/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpi1223/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpi1223/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-16T01:10:42Z","updated_at":"2020-03-16T01:10:42Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@altef Thank you very much for your confusion, I will try again.
