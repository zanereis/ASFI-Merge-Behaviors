I don't see this file being included in the Thrift npm package. So this file seems unused. Instead, the Thrift npm package includes the JS code for nodejs, but to make it usable from the browser, in package.json, it specifies a 'browser' field. This field points to a browser.js file, which defines a subset of the nodejs code to be activated in the browser. IMO, the directory `src` under `lib/js` is unused. Most likely it should be removed. But the tests should stay.\r\n \r\n- `lib/nodejs` contains `lib/thrift` (JS code for Thrift library for nodejs) and tests. This looks fine to me.\r\n\r\n- `lib/ts` contains `thrift.d.ts` (type mappings for the `lib/js/src/thrift.js`). This is another confusion point. As of now, Thrift type mappings seem to come from DefinitelyTyped (https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/types/thrift/index.d.ts).
