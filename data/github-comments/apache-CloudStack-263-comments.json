Yesterday I was not able to return to this issue.\r\n\r\nThat is what I thought first. However, there is something I do not understand here. This is what Gabriel, Nicolas and I tried to explain here.\r\n\r\nTake a look at line 336 and 516 where the variables `callerUser` and `caller` are used as parameters; if the decision to place or not a VR in a POD that is disabled is based on those variables, I would expect them to be used in `startVirtualRouter` method, right?\r\n\r\nSo, if you take a look at ` startVirtualRouter ` method, you are going to see that those variables are not used there. They are simply passed as parameters to another method, which is called `start`. The issue is the following. Variables `callerUser` and `caller` are not used in `start` method either. They are also not sent to any other method.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/352689132/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/352689561","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1760#issuecomment-352689561","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1760","id":352689561,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MjY4OTU2MQ==","user":{"login":"blueorangutan","id":16489489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDg5NDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16489489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan","html_url":"https://github.com/blueorangutan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-19T09:36:34Z","updated_at":"2017-12-19T09:36:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Packaging result: ✔centos6 ✔centos7 ✔debian.
