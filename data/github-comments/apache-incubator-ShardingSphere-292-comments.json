My project also uses open-tracing for jdbc, it will proxy the **getConnection()** method of **javax.sql.DataSource**, and spring 2.x uses cglib proxy by default, but ShardingSphereDataSource is a final class. So, if the **ShardingSphereDataSource** is proxied, this exception will occur. The similar code like this:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> @Aspect\r\n> public class JdbcAspect {\r\n> \r\n> \t@Around(\"execution(java.sql.Connection *.getConnection(..)) && target(javax.sql.DataSource)\")\r\n> \tpublic Object getConnection(final ProceedingJoinPoint pjp) throws Throwable {\r\n> \t    return new TracingConnection(conn);\r\n> \t}\r\n> \r\n> }\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nYou can change the proxy of spring to `jdk` proxy, but it is not recommended. After all, there is a reason why spring boot uses cglib proxy by default. You can refer to the relevant information\r\n\r\nIn fact, the best way is to disable dynamic proxying for `ShardingSphereDataSource`. We can change the beanName of ShardingSphereDataSource to `shardingSphereDataSource.ORIGINAL` and mark it as the original instance, so that Spring AOP will not proxy `ShardingSphereDataSource`. The relevant code of Spring AOP is as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.springframework.aop.framework.autoproxy.AbstractAutoProxyCreator#shouldSkip\r\nprotected boolean shouldSkip(Class<?> beanClass, String beanName) {\r\n\treturn AutoProxyUtils.isOriginalInstance(beanName, beanClass);\r\n}\r\n\r\nAutoProxyUtils#isOriginalInstance\r\nstatic boolean isOriginalInstance(String beanName, Class<?> beanClass) {\r\n\tif (!StringUtils.hasLength(beanName) || beanName.length() !=\r\n\t\t\tbeanClass.getName().length() + AutowireCapableBeanFactory.ORIGINAL_INSTANCE_SUFFIX.length()) {\r\n\t\treturn false;\r\n\t}\r\n\treturn (beanName.startsWith(beanClass.getName()) &&\r\n\t\t\tbeanName.endsWith(AutowireCapableBeanFactory.ORIGINAL_INSTANCE_SUFFIX));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n1. **Option 1, declare the `DataSource` defined in `ShardingSphereAutoConfiguration.java` as `@Bean(\"shardingSphereDataSource.ORIGINAL\")`, `@Bean(\"dataSource.ORIGINAL\")`**\r\n```\r\npublic class ShardingSphereAutoConfiguration implements EnvironmentAware {\r\n    @Bean(\"shardingSphereDataSource.ORIGINAL\")\r\n    @Conditional(LocalRulesCondition.class)\r\n    @Autowired(required = false)\r\n    public DataSource shardingSphereDataSource(final ObjectProvider<List<RuleConfiguration>> rules, final ObjectProvider<ModeConfiguration> modeConfig) throws SQLException {\r\n        //……\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Bean(\"dataSource.ORIGINAL\")\r\n    @ConditionalOnMissingBean(DataSource.class)\r\n    public DataSource dataSource(final ModeConfiguration modeConfig) throws SQLException {\r\n        return ShardingSphereDataSourceFactory.createDataSource(schemaName, modeConfig);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. **Option 2, modify `beanName` through `BeanDefinitionRegistryPostProcessor`**, the code is as follows:\r\n```\r\n@Configuration\r\npublic class ShardingSphereRegistryPostProcessor implements BeanDefinitionRegistryPostProcessor {\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void postProcessBeanDefinitionRegistry(BeanDefinitionRegistry registry) throws BeansException {\r\n        String className = ShardingSphereDataSource.class.getName();\r\n        String beanName = \"shardingSphereDataSource\";\r\n        if(registry.containsBeanDefinition(beanName)){\r\n            BeanDefinition shardingSphereDataSource = registry.getBeanDefinition(beanName);\r\n            registry.removeBeanDefinition(beanName);\r\n            registry.registerBeanDefinition(className + AutowireCapableBeanFactory.ORIGINAL_INSTANCE_SUFFIX , shardingSphereDataSource);\r\n            return;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void postProcessBeanFactory(ConfigurableListableBeanFactory beanFactory) throws BeansException {\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPersonally, I prefer the official modification of beanName by shardingSphere.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/1066283999/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/1066291697","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/16043#issuecomment-1066291697","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/16043","id":1066291697,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAvkN_M4_jlHx","user":{"login":"Swastyy","id":64654203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NjU0MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64654203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Swastyy","html_url":"https://github.com/Swastyy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Swastyy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Swastyy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Swastyy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Swastyy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Swastyy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Swastyy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Swastyy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Swastyy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Swastyy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-14T03:04:10Z","updated_at":"2022-03-14T03:04:10Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hey

How about use Map to instead of Pair?\r\n\r\nI've investigated on this topic. It's possible to use Map instead of Pair, but it might has some side effects. Details as following.\r\n\r\nSince there's\r\n```\r\n        for (Entry<Class<? extends YamlRuleConfiguration>, YamlRuleConfiguration> entry : targetRulesMap.entrySet()) {\r\n            if (!sourceRulesMap.containsKey(entry.getKey())) {\r\n                result.add(Pair.of(null, entry.getValue()));\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n```\r\nThere might be several key elements are `null`, so we need to put `null` as value and use value elements as map key else some value elements will be replaced, e.g. `map.put(entry.getValue(), null)`.\r\n\r\nConsidering the scaling scenario, the possible side effects if we change `Collection<Pair>` to `Map`:\r\n1. `createJobConfig` just need a collection or array to iterate, no `get`, it doesn't really need hash or tree map. According to `Development Guidelines` readability, using `Collection<Pair>` is better for code purpose than using `Map`.\r\n2. For `boolean isRuleAltered(YamlRuleConfiguration sourceRuleConfig, YamlRuleConfiguration targetRuleConfig)` method, the first and second parameter's meaning is defined.\r\n- 1) When using `Map`, target rule config might be transferred to `sourceRuleConfig`, which is confusing.\r\n- 2) Currently, `isRuleAltered` method just do rough comparison of old version rule and new version rule, but we need to do detailed comparison later, some rule change doesn't mean scaling job is necessary. Transfer target rule config to `sourceRuleConfig` might cause issue, e.g. if dataSources is not changed, cleanup sharding rule might not need to do scaling, but add sharding rule need to do scaling. So when we exchange `sourceRuleConfig` and `targetRuleConfig`, they're not equivalent.\r\n- 3) It's possible to keep parameters ordering when invoking `isRuleAltered` method, but it make code more complicated.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/1066443688/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/1066456143","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/15925#issuecomment-1066456143","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/15925","id":1066456143,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAvkN_M4_kNRP","user":{"login":"RaigorJiang","id":5668787,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2Njg3ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5668787?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaigorJiang","html_url":"https://github.com/RaigorJiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaigorJiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaigorJiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaigorJiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaigorJiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaigorJiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaigorJiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaigorJiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaigorJiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaigorJiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-14T07:20:19Z","updated_at":"2022-03-14T07:20:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @Comven \r\nI investigated according to the configuration and table structure you provided and found that the algorithm behaves normally.

How about split the pair as updated map and new collection? If the key is null, it means there are not original config, which should belong to new collection.\r\n\r\nMy investigation:\r\nIt's possible to do it, but the code might be more complicated than before.\r\nCurrent code snippet:\r\n```\r\n    private Optional<JobConfiguration> createJobConfig(final StartScalingEvent event) {\r\n        //...\r\n        for (Pair<YamlRuleConfiguration, YamlRuleConfiguration> each : groupSourceTargetRuleConfigsByType(sourceRootConfig.getRules(), targetRootConfig.getRules())) {\r\n        //...\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private Collection<Pair<YamlRuleConfiguration, YamlRuleConfiguration>> groupSourceTargetRuleConfigsByType(final Collection<YamlRuleConfiguration> sourceRules, \r\n                                                                                                              final Collection<YamlRuleConfiguration> targetRules) {\r\n        //...\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nCurrently, `groupSourceTargetRuleConfigsByType` method return unified `Collection<Pair>`, and `createJobConfig` method just need one `for` loop.\r\n\r\nIf we split pairs to updated map and new collection, possible changes:\r\n1. Split `groupSourceTargetRuleConfigsByType` method to `2` methods, one return `Map` and another return `Collection<ruleConfig>`.\r\n2. In `createJobConfig`, add another `for` loop to iterate `Collection<ruleConfig>`.\r\n3. In `createJobConfig`, in order to reuse the code of `for` loop, we need to extract it into a new method.\r\n\r\nIt might be not worth to do it.\r\n\r\nAnother consideration, pair and tuple are basic data structrue in some programming languages, they're useful sometimes.\r\n\r\nSo I think it's better to keep pair in project when it's needed.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/1067672513/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/1067720736","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/pull/16067#issuecomment-1067720736","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/16067","id":1067720736,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAvkN_M4_pCAg","user":{"login":"RaigorJiang","id":5668787,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2Njg3ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5668787?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaigorJiang","html_url":"https://github.com/RaigorJiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaigorJiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaigorJiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaigorJiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaigorJiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaigorJiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaigorJiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaigorJiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaigorJiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaigorJiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-15T08:55:32Z","updated_at":"2022-03-15T08:55:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"

@qiuxiaotong2021 \r\nhey guys I have read all this issue's comments and  think it's necessary to reopen this issue .\r\n### First \r\nI think the comment I have quote is not the final reply that   \r\n\r\n> more appropriate for hibernate to provide this annotation\r\n\r\n  \r\nand it doesn't solution the problem.\r\n### Second \r\nlet me example:\r\ntable AAA use 'id' as primary key and use 'did' as sharding key .\r\nnow I need to edit some columns from backstage, I think it's a very easy and universal function, but wow it says **'Can not update sharding key'** and don't have Elegant solutions,  now I have to judge every column and use jpa‘s nativeQuery to update columns .\r\nwe use did to distinguish different user so it can be the same.\r\n### Final \r\nlet me guess the question I have figure out when I have debug, \r\n![shardingsphereDebug](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24791147/158369713-0216adb9-5334-4b88-8ffe-39b8531d889e.png)\r\nin this pic shardingValue is

'did' but in Evaluate I excute column.getIdentifier().getValue() and it return 'id' so i think it just consider when shardingColumn is primary key and value equals and then pass but not contain when shardingKey is not primary key's case.\r\nmy english is not good but I'd like to discuss this problem.
