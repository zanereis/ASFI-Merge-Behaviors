I looked over this again and I think we have to address some things:\n- The problem you mentioned on the mailing list with respect to to flattening is actually something we should not ignore. Can't we create the directory manually and then copy the files there instead of flattening?\n- With #2345 the RocksDB part will be removed and we only use `copyFromLocal` in YARN for JAR copies. Therefore I would move the utility method to `flink-yarn/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/yarn/Utils.java` and only use it in YARN (ignore the RocksDB part).\n- The check for the `file://` scheme is unrelated and we should address in a separate issue (remove `checkFileScheme` and `checkInitialDirectory`). This might point to a bug in some other place actually.\n\nFeel free to ping me if you don't have time to address this and I can also do it.

Why do we need a field accessor in the TypeInformation?\n\nWe need this for situations when the user specifies a nested field expression which goes through different types. (E.g. `.sum(\"foo.f1.bar\")` on a POJO, where the field `foo` is a Tuple, and `f1` is a POJO again.) In this case, getFieldAccessor can recursively call itself on the TypeInformation of the field, which will be a virtual call that goes to the override for the field's

may be the wrong place to bring this up, but as you are discussing changes to the Kafka connector API, I think it is worth bring it up.  \n\nAs I've pointed out elsewhere, the current connector API makes it difficult to make use of Kafka native serializer or deserializer (`org.apache.kafka.common.[Serializer, Deserializer]`), which can be configured via the Kafka client and producer configs.  \n\nThe connector code assumes that `ConsummerRecord`s and `ProducerRecord`s are both parametrized as `<byte[], byte[]>`, with the Flink serdes performing the conversion to/from `byte[]`.  This makes it difficult to make use of Confluent's `KafkaAvroSerializer` and `KafkaAvroDecoder`, which make use of their [schema registry](http://docs.confluent.io/3.0.0/schema-registry/docs/serializer-formatter.html#serializer).\n\nIf you are going to change the connector API, it would be good to tackle this issue at the same time to avoid future changes.  The connector should allow the type parametrization of the Kafka consumer and producer, and should make use of a pass through Flink serde by default.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/241800230/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/241844439","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2240#issuecomment-241844439","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2240","id":241844439,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MTg0NDQzOQ==","user":{"login":"jagatfx","id":198755,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5ODc1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/198755?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jagatfx","html_url":"https://github.com/jagatfx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jagatfx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jagatfx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jagatfx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jagatfx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jagatfx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jagatfx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jagatfx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jagatfx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jagatfx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-23T19:12:50Z","updated_at":"2016-08-23T19:12:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@iemejia Were you able to followup on creating the official docker image.

Make var as final\n2. Implement TaskExecutorConfiguration class in java instead of TaskManagerConfiguration in scala, the NetworkEnvironmentConfiguration should also be rewrote by java, but it will cause import mistake in NetworkEnvironment, so retain the current implementation.\n3. Replace scala tuple2<hostname, port> by InetAddress, and the scala tuple4 by org.apache.flink.api.java.tuple.Tuple4\n4. Remove throws in checkConfigParameter method\n5. There are two public static methods  \"selectNetworkInterfaceAndRunTaskManager\" and \"startTaskManagerComponentsAndActor\" that can be invoked by outside world. For startTaskManagerComponentsAndActor method, the parameters should pass \"RPCService\" and  \"HighAvailabilityServices\" for constructing \"TaskExecutor\" directly. For \"startTaskManagerComponentsAndActor\" method, we will generate the default \"RPCService\" and \"HighAvailabilityServices\" or based on configuration. \n6.

The implementation of the `HeartbeatScheduler` goes in the right direction so that it is reusable :-) The testing is also better. However, we're still mixing different things in this PR (e.g. parts of the slot requesting logic).\n\nI think we can further generalize the heartbeating since the heartbeat manager is another component which should be reusable across components (e.g. for the JobManager to heartbeat the TMs). Furthermore, the receiving end of the heartbeating is not properly defined. \n\nI think it would be best if we first properly define how this should look like. For example, I'm not sure whether the exponential backoff strategy is the right way to go since it can happen that you wait twice as long as you've defined until you're notified about a heartbeat failure. Another question is whether every heartbeat connection should be responsible for triggering itself or whether the heartbeat manager should be responsible for that. Then we have to define the receiving end. Is the heartbeat receiving end an independent `RpcEndpoint`? How does the payload delivery works? Does the sender side asks for the result (future) or does the receiving side answers via a tell message to the heartbeat manager?\n\nI've created an issue where we should continue the discussion
