I wrote a quick test to just manual check for nonnull s and when you do that it crashes attempting to check the min and max bounds.\r\n\r\nThis makes me think we need to make a backup isEmpty check. This would see whether nullcount is 0 and min/max are undefined. In this case we should also treat the stats as empty","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/712918616/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/712956694","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1631#issuecomment-712956694","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1631","id":712956694,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxMjk1NjY5NA==","user":{"login":"marton-bod","id":19599214,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTk5MjE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19599214?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marton-bod","html_url":"https://github.com/marton-bod","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marton-bod/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marton-bod/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marton-bod/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marton-bod/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marton-bod/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marton-bod/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marton-bod/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marton-bod/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marton-bod/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-20T15:59:52Z","updated_at":"2020-10-20T15:59:52Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Thanks for your review @rdblue!

For your own update, a lot of things in that PR seem to have been somewhat merged in.\r\n\r\nPossibly try forking off of your current branch and merging in master to check the diff. A number of files might go away.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you check this PR (which I thought I linked to this issue but somehow the link didn't show), you'll see that the `Microbatches` class that's in your PR exists in some form: https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1627/files\r\n\r\nI just updated one  javadoc comment and then added some tests to verify behavior. So I would think that possibly seeing if you can take your old PR (and the changes that you mentioned if you should like), place them in a new branch based off of the latest master, and see if the overall PR gets smaller.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that it might still need to be broken up into one or two refactor PRs, but I think the overall size of it will be much smaller.

look at the nextRecord contract from the `InputFormat`. reuse or not is controlled by the caller of `nextRecord(OT reuse)`. \r\n```\r\n\t/**\r\n\t * @param reuse Object that may be reused.\r\n\t */\r\n\tOT nextRecord(OT reuse) throws IOException;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the input `reuse` arg is null, there is no reuse. Otherwise, input arg should be used for deserialization. That is how `BinaryInputFormat` implemented.\r\n```\r\n\t@Override\r\n\tpublic T nextRecord(T record) throws IOException {\r\n                // ...\r\n\t\trecord = this.deserialize(record, this.dataInputStream);\r\n                // ...\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`CloseableIterable<T>` interface is just NOT a good fit for InputFormat interface. Now the `FlinkInputFormat` ignore the reuse hint from caller and simply returns reused RowData object.\r\n```\r\n  @Override\r\n  public RowData nextRecord(RowData reuse) {\r\n    return iterator.next();\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo technically, `FlinkInputFormat` is not conforming to the contract of `InputFormat` interface.  If we truly want to implement the correct nextRecord contract, we need to change the `CloseableIterable/Iterator` to support `next(T reuse)`, which is impossible to change the java `Iterator` interface. If it can't conform to the contract, maybe the default behavior should be the more conservative (and less performant) behavior of no reuse.\r\n\r\nWe don't use InputFormat internally. So its behavior is not very relevant to us. This is purely a semantic discussion.

I also checked the [RecordWriter](https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/master/flink-runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/runtime/io/network/api/writer/RecordWriter.java#L100),  for every emited record,  it would serialized into a ByteBuffer .  So in theory, regardless of enabling or disabling object reuse,  it actually would copy the object into a totally new ByteBuffer,  we don't have to worry about the objects messing up issue caused by reuse at flink runtime at least.
