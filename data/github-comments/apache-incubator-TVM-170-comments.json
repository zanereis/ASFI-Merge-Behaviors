Pre-built Tensorflow are built with older version of GCC requiring _GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0. So unless we can afford to build Tensorflow (quite expensive) along with TVM in CI, it seems we would need to change _GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI to 0. This is, however, unless there are other reasons that force TVM CI to use _GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=1.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/601033018/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/601055446","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/5047#issuecomment-601055446","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5047","id":601055446,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwMTA1NTQ0Ng==","user":{"login":"wweic","id":594848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/594848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic","html_url":"https://github.com/wweic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-19T08:40:19Z","updated_at":"2020-03-19T08:40:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tqchen Could you give me pointers to codes where we can use the python string api to pass strings around?
