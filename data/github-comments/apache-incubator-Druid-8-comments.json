of the SMOOSH tends to be about 10% larger for Roaring vs Concise.\n- Simple topN and timeseries queries seem unaffected by changes in underlying bitmap representation.\n- topN over regex filters have a significant improvement (~20%) in execution time when using Roaring over Concise.\n- topN with 10 filter conditions OR'ed together yields a small but notable (~3%) improvement in execution time\n- Simple time series with 10 filter conditions OR'ed together can yield a significant ( up to ~30%) improvement in execution time.

 \n\nThanks.\n\nOne has to assess how much does the bitmap computation accounts for the total running time. If bitmap computations account for 40% of the total running time, and you see a 20% overall gain, then this would, indeed, correspond to a 2x performance gain in bitmap processing speed. (This is hypothetical, of course.)\n\nThis being said, the performance characteristics of roaring are really quite different from concise, so the fact that you see no difference at all in several cases suggest that maybe the bitmap computations are not a bottleneck in these cases... Maybe the bulk of the running time is spent doing things other than bitmap processing in these cases... \n\nIn any case, it would be very useful to have some kind of idea about how much of these tests rely on bitmap speed. They are small enough, it seems, that IO costs are many not a major issue... \n\nSome kind of profiling would be great... Do you have guys have any good experiences profiling Druid? Do you use any tools? In other projects, I have used JProfiler, but I have never approached something quite as big as Druid.\n\nAs for storage space, we have documented cases where concise compresses better than roaring: when the data is dominated by long consecutive sequences all around. This was the case in one of our data sets, Wikileaks, where we got a percentage of difference with storage costs close to the one you report. (See our paper http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.6407) We did not worry about such cases because we still offered a significant speed gain with roaring. It would be relatively easy to do a more thorough analysis to explain the storage use... for example, review the bitmaps generated and their relative sizes in roaring and concise vs. their characteristics. This could inform further work.\n\nc.c. @samytto\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/62551148/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/62582731","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/823#issuecomment-62582731","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/823","id":62582731,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNTgyNzMx","user":{"login":"drcrallen","id":8213081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMTMwODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8213081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen","html_url":"https://github.com/drcrallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-11T17:24:35Z","updated_at":"2014-11-11T17:24:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@lemire : yes, that is exactly why regex topN was chosen as one of the test cases. In that case the underlying engine does a TON of unions of underlying bitmaps. And, as expected, roaring pulls notably ahead of concise in execution time. It is suspected that evaluating the regex takes a significant chunk time in this type of query (but I don't have profiling to back that up yet).\n\nWhat is notably lacking from my prior test is a case with filtering, which I'm working on spinning up now.\n\nFor anyone else reading this thread, please note that these are intended to be _data points_ not final conclusions. I'll update my prior post to make that a little clearer.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/62582731/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/62625628","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/768#issuecomment-62625628","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/768","id":62625628,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNjI1NjI4","user":{"login":"drcrallen","id":8213081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMTMwODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8213081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen","html_url":"https://github.com/drcrallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-11T21:34:38Z","updated_at":"2014-11-11T21:34:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@fjy  / @nishantmonu51 #764 is marked as potentially solved by this.
