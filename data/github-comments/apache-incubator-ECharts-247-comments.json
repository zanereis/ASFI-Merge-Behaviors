there !\r\n\r\nI have a created a jsfiddle using the code provided by @mbury (updated the echarts library to use 4.4.0 because the bug changed) ,\r\n\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/0kqyjgw9/1/\r\n\r\nPlease note that this is a bug that occurs on the drag of the zoom slider after chart **setOption** is called.\r\n\r\nOn the first time that you drag the zoom slider you see the labels stuck showing only the start and end of the range. (see the labels of the zoom slider on the next 3 screenshots they are all stuck at 10-04 1997 and 06-29 2000)\r\n![Screenshot from 2019-11-12 12-24-28](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/890368/68663606-ab1f6600-0547-11ea-95fe-0efcda0d0834.png)\r\n![Screenshot from 2019-11-12 12-24-34](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/890368/68663612-ae1a5680-0547-11ea-89a8-550763f5c794.png)\r\n![Screenshot from 2019-11-12 12-24-39](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/890368/68663622-b07cb080-0547-11ea-87dd-28ca31197030.png)\r\n\r\nOn the second and rest of the times you can see the correct labels (which is the current slider range).\r\n(see the labels of the zoom slider on the next 3 screenshots that are changing correctly)\r\n![Screenshot from 2019-11-12 12-29-37](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/890368/68664036-55978900-0548-11ea-98d4-7f7262bb6fd4.png)\r\n![Screenshot from 2019-11-12 12-29-41](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/890368/68664043-58927980-0548-11ea-848f-360fe7d07352.png)\r\n![Screenshot from 2019-11-12 12-29-46](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/890368/68664047-5af4d380-0548-11ea-9c45-1866e5133d3b.png)\r\n\r\nThis is a very important thing to be fixed for us. Because we have an ajax callback that sets the chart options and thus every time the labels on the zoom slider are not shown.\r\n\r\nThank you for your
