Remove all `.iml` files and `.idea/` using `find . -name *.iml -exec rm -rf {} \\; && rm -r .idea/`\r\n3. Reopen your project with Intellij\r\n\r\nTherefore no `.iml` files would be generated in project directories. The Intellij could detect the deletion of directories and notify you to update the project.\r\n\r\nHope this helps. :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/comments/686860503/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/comments/687141437","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tika/pull/350#issuecomment-687141437","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/350","id":687141437,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4NzE0MTQzNw==","user":{"login":"tballison","id":6739646,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3Mzk2NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6739646?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tballison","html_url":"https://github.com/tballison","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tballison/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tballison/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tballison/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tballison/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tballison/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tballison/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tballison/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tballison/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tballison/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-04T13:21:24Z","updated_at":"2020-09-04T13:21:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Oooo...fun... thank you!\r\n\r\nIs the build working for you now?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/comments/687141437/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/comments/687511400","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tika/pull/350#issuecomment-687511400","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/350","id":687511400,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4NzUxMTQwMA==","user":{"login":"PeterAlfredLee","id":55973914,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1OTczOTE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55973914?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterAlfredLee","html_url":"https://github.com/PeterAlfredLee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterAlfredLee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterAlfredLee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterAlfredLee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterAlfredLee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterAlfredLee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterAlfredLee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterAlfredLee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterAlfredLee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterAlfredLee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-05T01:32:38Z","updated_at":"2020-09-05T01:32:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Yes, It works good !

I don't like this idea. Iterating through the zip without any reading would not save more time than reading all entries - we would always extract and read the data of the entry(see also `ZipArchiveInputStream.drainCurrentEntryData` about this) even through you didn't call `ZipArchiveInputStream.read`.\r\n\r\nZip archives could be pretty huge. Iterating them twice may be a time consuming job.
