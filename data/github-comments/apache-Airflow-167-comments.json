Also, our email_on_retry and email_on_failure is marked true, so once we see this issue of race condition, we will get an email something like below\r\n\r\n> Try 2 out of 4\r\n> Exception:\r\n> Executor reports task instance %s finished (%s) although the task says its %s.

our side, where we were not able to reproduce issue when dag_folder consist less number of files but as soon as it touched 40+ Dags in our dag_folder, we were able to reproduce, probably increasing dags in dag_folder increasing 1 cycle of dags processing.\r\n\r\nEDIT-2: Dag which was used to reproduce this issue can be found
