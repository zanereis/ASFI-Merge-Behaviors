Thanks, besides the lint issues (https://travis-ci.org/apache/libcloud/jobs/13222251), it looks good.\n\nPlease address those, squash the commits, attach patch to the jira ticket and I'll merge it into trunk.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/27333066/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/27333419","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/171#issuecomment-27333419","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/171","id":27333419,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MzMzNDE5","user":{"login":"bsdlp","id":744549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NDU0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/744549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsdlp","html_url":"https://github.com/bsdlp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsdlp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsdlp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsdlp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsdlp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsdlp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsdlp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsdlp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsdlp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsdlp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-10-29T19:06:37Z","updated_at":"2013-10-29T19:06:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"done.

I think the best approach would be to allow user to pass in either a base `auth_url` without a path (e.g. `https://192.168.100.100`) or a full `auth_url` with a path (e.g. `http://192.168.100.100/v1.0/auth`, `http://192.168.100.100/`).\n\nIf user passes in just a base url, default auth path is appended to it, otherwise, the url is used directly the way it's passed in.\n\nThis also makes more sense, since currently the variable is called `auth_url` and now `base_auth_url` so you would expect you can pass in a whole url with a
