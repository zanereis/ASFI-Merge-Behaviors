benefit is actually not just command-line `git` itself but other mature tools that use the git history. GitHub is a reasonable exception, since they have their own protocol for email claiming.\r\n\r\nAnyhow I look at the history far more often through `git` than through GitHub, especially in interesting cases. So, personally, it is already nice even if that is the only benefit. Probably I am not the only one.\r\n\r\nI considered your cons before putting this together, but have these thoughts:\r\n\r\n - Actually every email address here is already present in the git log. Anyone writing a scraper will go there first, since it is more common. I deliberately have not added any information. If anything, it will actually make some scrapers get fewer emails :-). I will seek approvals from people listed though. \r\n - The administrative burden is a good thing to think of, but I propose to not centrally administer the list, thus making the burden zero. I am offering this initial list as a volunteer effort on my part. After that, it can just be as folks desire. You'll also notice that a lot of the bad names are just from tool-generated history, so the burden is much lower going forwards. (more contributors, but fewer needed in this file)\r\n - As for the format, there are a few different formats and you can choose them on a line-by-line basis. I chose one that seemed very simple. I've checked it out and didn't see obvious issues, but it is my first attempt at a `.mailmap`.\r\n\r\nSo in summary in my opinion we can easily choose for the cons to measure zero, but also the pros are not very important. Just some nice polish.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/277861559/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/277861877","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/1855#issuecomment-277861877","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/1855","id":277861877,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3Nzg2MTg3Nw==","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-07T00:38:45Z","updated_at":"2017-02-07T00:38:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Based on mailing list discussion and comments here, I think this is g2g.

However, I wanted to point out web crawling way of scrapping things. Before this PR, web crawler probably wouldn't get it; after it, it will. This is the most common.
