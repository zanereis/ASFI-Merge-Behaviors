It is not something u can just call - in this sense it is closer to freevars then to a pass.\r\nMaking it a pass just give people footgun to shoot themselves. (for example, ppl might pass a module into the AD pass, and transform all function to the AD mode).\r\nbut this is not how it is supposed to be use at all! It will probably just fail to type check, but for now, IMO it is best to make it just a standalone function, while I work on training and figure out how to make it part of our story.\r\n\r\ncan you revert this change? thank you.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/506600924/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/506606854","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3430#issuecomment-506606854","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3430","id":506606854,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNjYwNjg1NA==","user":{"login":"zhiics","id":5145158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDUxNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5145158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics","html_url":"https://github.com/zhiics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-28T05:33:17Z","updated_at":"2019-06-28T05:33:17Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@MarisaKirisame Okay.

Here are a few thoughts.\r\n\r\nLet us put a concise namespace for the quantization dialect. Two possible candidates:\r\n\r\n- ```relay.op.qnn```, e.g. relay.op.qnn.conv2d\r\n   - The qnn name is consistent with QNNPack   \r\n- ```relay.op.tflite``` \r\n    - The op name is a dialect.\r\n\r\nIn both cases, they are a dialect of relay, which means by default we do not want to introduce special implementation, but instead will translate them into existing core ops. We need to have a special op_level for these core ops.\r\n\r\nI still think we should minimize the number of operators, and directly translate to lower ops if possible. This includes things like ``` quantize/dequantize```, and qnn.concat.
