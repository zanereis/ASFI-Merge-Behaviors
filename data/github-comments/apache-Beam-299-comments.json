bom](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-java/tree/master/google-cloud-bom) it is fairly easy to pull in the correct set of netty/grpc/etc dependencies for gcp. publishing a beam bom would reduce the amount of pain required to get a functioning set of dependencies in user jobs. shading is still necessary (thanks at least to netty) but it's much less painful than trying to find the

I believe this works correctly with watermarking. It will not work with fault-tolerance, though, because of a very peculiar \"feature\" of Flink: if any of the operators of a topology shut down checkpointing will not work anymore. However, in practice this is not a problem since sources of a streaming topology are not supposed to shut down so we will never come to `close()` in real-world use cases.\r\n\r\nThe issue this PR fixes only comes up in tests because we have bounded sources in a streaming pipeline, meaning we actually see a `close()` happening.\r\n\r\nAlso, there are two operators in Flink that follow the same pattern: \r\n - https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/6593e0f9e6db9d862afadeeae79e0afa2590fd73/flink-streaming-java/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/streaming/api/operators/async/AsyncWaitOperator.java#L275\r\n - https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/8119baaf1bd5f22a6fd14909b61f01c644b62a66/flink-streaming-java/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/streaming/api/functions/source/ContinuousFileReaderOperator.java#L196\r\n\r\nI'm not saying that I like this, to be honest, I'm just saying that this is the way we currently have to do it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/364394332/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/364417967","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/4500#issuecomment-364417967","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4500","id":364417967,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDQxNzk2Nw==","user":{"login":"jbonofre","id":158903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODkwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/158903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre","html_url":"https://github.com/jbonofre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-09T12:14:03Z","updated_at":"2018-02-09T12:14:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I'm fixing gradle build.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/364417967/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/364423463","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/4500#issuecomment-364423463","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4500","id":364423463,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDQyMzQ2Mw==","user":{"login":"jbonofre","id":158903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODkwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/158903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre","html_url":"https://github.com/jbonofre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-09T12:41:27Z","updated_at":"2018-02-09T12:41:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"gradle build is fixed now.

This *is* the intended use case of SDF: e.g. to read 1 Kafka topic, create a \"bounded\" source containing 1 element (name of the topic), followed by an SDF that reads kafka topics. The \"bounded source\" emits the single element and immediately completes, but the SDF runs perpetually.\r\n\r\nThis on its own might seem silly (\"why not express reading from Kafka as a root operator?\"), but SDF affords the flexibility that you now can also easily read a collection of Kafka topics, bounded or not (e.g. receive over a Kafka topic a stream of names of new Kafka topics to read). Or more interestingly: you can create a \"bounded\" source containing a set of filepatterns, and apply to it two SDFs: one (filepattern -> new files as they appear), the other (file -> new records as the file grows).\r\n\r\nIt also seems problematic that close() is rarely exercised in Flink pipelines. That means that this codepath is probably buggy in ways we don't know, it would be awkward if it started playing a central role in most streaming pipelines as the various unbounded sources are transitioned to SDF.\r\n\r\nAm I understanding correctly that, if the upstream operators didn't terminate, then you wouldn't need to put the processing into close()? Maybe that's the way to fix this - have Flink in streaming mode treat bounded sources as unbounded, in the sense that once they emit their elements, instead of terminating, they just hang forever pretending that they might have more data?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/364612202/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/364612510","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/4643#issuecomment-364612510","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4643","id":364612510,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDYxMjUxMA==","user":{"login":"yifanzou","id":35050780,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MDUwNzgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35050780?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifanzou","html_url":"https://github.com/yifanzou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifanzou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifanzou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifanzou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifanzou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifanzou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifanzou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifanzou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifanzou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifanzou/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-10T01:10:01Z","updated_at":"2018-02-10T01:10:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Run
