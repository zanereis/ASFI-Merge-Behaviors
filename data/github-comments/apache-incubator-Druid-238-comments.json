We're using a TSV in S3 for a namespace lookup (at least to start with, we will probably switch over to a JDBC source eventually). We have a single key column, which always corresponds to the same actual dimension in Druid. We have a dozen lookup columns (could grow by a handful, but I'd think no more than 20). And we're starting pretty small now with only about 100K rows, but expect that could grow to several million rows before too long.\r\n> \r\n> We don't need this updated really frequently. Actually we're still working out our ETLs and so forth to deal with revisions and additions to the lookup data. But I wouldn't expect us to have updates more frequently than hourly, and probably more like daily.\r\n> \r\n> As far as pain points with this arrangement - there is sure plenty of boilerplate in the config. I have an array of a dozen entries in `druid.query.extraction.namespace.lookups` that are identical in all fields except for `namespace` and `valueColumn`. A bit clunky but not so much that I'd complain about it really - I did write a couple of simple scripts that generate the stuff to be placed in config.\r\n> \r\n> I'm more concerned about the overhead when we do update the lookup source. Druid will have to load and parse this (potentially sized) 20 x 3M TSV once per lookup. I haven't done any benchmarking but I have noticed that it can take on the order of 15 seconds to completely load our current 12 x 100K case. Even if it takes a few minutes that is not a gamebreaker (assuming it does not interfere with query performance or produce inconsistent results while in progress). But it certainly seems like it could be a lot more efficient to load and parse the file once instead of 12 or 20 times.\r\n> \r\n> Overall, the configuration and use feels a bit clunky, I think because from the user point of view, we have just one \"lookup namespace\" - there is a single source, and a single key column. It would feel more natural to define the data source level properties (uri, format, columns) and key column once, along with a list of allowed targetColumns, then use it in dimension specs and filters by referencing just the one single namespace plus a targetColumn. It might start to look like an ingestion spec at that point, with dataSchema- and ioConfig-like sections.\r\n> \r\n> But honestly I don't know how much of a priority I'd want it to be. Associating a single namespace with a single key column and multiple value columns might well be overfitting to our specific case, and it 's certainly quite usable as it stands.\r\n> \r\n> (One side note, the ability to include columns in the CSV which are not key or value columns is useful for assembling the data manually - we can include \"friendly name\" sort of columns that are helpful to people who are filling in or auditing the actual lookup data.)\r\n\r\nHi there, please i am trying to configure Druid to load a lookup file from s3, how do i do this? Do i use the `file:/` syntax or there is another syntax for loading lookups from s3?
