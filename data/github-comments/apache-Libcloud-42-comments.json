for the delay in my response. \r\n\r\nA big part of the changes come from updating the fixtures. I also reorganized the driver file to satisfy your code conventions, mostly function and method ordering, but makes the diff a bit hard to read.\r\n\r\nI will try and update the tests in the following weeks to keep coverage at the same level.\r\n\r\nThe changes are mainly made to support Gandi vlan operations,  not related to libcloud components. I added an optional \"farm\" parameter to Node creation and some logic to make a distinction between private and public ips for Node operations.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/422819131/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/424063305","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/1240#issuecomment-424063305","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/1240","id":424063305,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNDA2MzMwNQ==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-24T17:46:14Z","updated_at":"2018-09-24T18:18:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1240?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#1240](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1240?src=pr&el=desc) into [trunk](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/commit/bad71c41ece620a1d7d957eb0fee66f2787e66fa?src=pr&el=desc) will **increase** coverage by `<.01%`.\n> The diff coverage is `100%`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1240/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=PYoduksh69&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1240?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@            Coverage Diff             @@\n##            trunk    #1240      +/-   ##\n==========================================\n+ Coverage   86.26%   86.27%   +<.01%     \n==========================================\n  Files         351      351              \n  Lines       67962    67973      +11     \n  Branches     5987     5988       +1     \n==========================================\n+ Hits        58630    58643      +13     \n+ Misses       6888     6886       -2     \n  Partials     2444     2444\n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1240?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [libcloud/compute/drivers/ec2.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1240/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-bGliY2xvdWQvY29tcHV0ZS9kcml2ZXJzL2VjMi5weQ==) | `74.28% <100%> (+0.04%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [libcloud/test/compute/test\\_ec2.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1240/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-bGliY2xvdWQvdGVzdC9jb21wdXRlL3Rlc3RfZWMyLnB5) | `97.9% <100%> (+0.17%)` | :arrow_up: |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1240?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1240?src=pr&el=footer).
