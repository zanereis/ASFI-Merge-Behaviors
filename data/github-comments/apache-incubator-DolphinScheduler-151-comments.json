k8s, the worker always uses the same svc address as the host to register to zk. When the job restarts, although the zk listener is triggered, it will register the same address. At this time, the channel buffer of the communication layer has not been cleared. There are two places to actually clean up the corresponding host address. The first is that the getChannel method determines that it is not active. It will create a resolution ip based on the domain name, then establish a channel connection to this address, and finally overwrite the same key in the cache (the key here is the hostname); the second is to use the exceptionCaught method of the netty channel to clean up, because the channel is used here remoteAddress clears the cache, obtains the ip and port through remoteAddress, and then clears the above from the channel cache through the assembled address (note: the ip address may not be able to clear the channel with the hostname as the key), which causes the channel in the channel cache to be invalid. Then it seems to be a more effective way to clean up invalid channels in the cache when the error exceeds the limit, so it can also prevent the next schedule from acquiring the problematic channel.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/962426641/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/962426683","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/pull/6717#issuecomment-962426683","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/6717","id":962426683,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms45XXc7","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-06T09:50:18Z","updated_at":"2021-11-06T09:57:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#

Search before asking\n\n- [X] I had searched in the [issues](https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues?q=is%3Aissue) and found no similar feature requirement.\n\n\n### Description\n\nHello, I want to feed back the usage. The yarnhaips I configured are ha three nodes,\r\n\r\nThe resourcemanagerhttpaddressport is configured with port 8080,\r\n\r\nThe active node port of the company cluster is 8080, but the standby node is 8088,\r\n\r\nI can only configure one port number when I use http://yarnIp1:%s/ws/v1/cluster/apps/%s time\r\n\r\nIf the requested node is a standby node, the function httputils.get (URL) returns a null string,\r\n\r\nIt will directly lead to the success of the task call, but the task status in DS will return failure,\r\n\r\nIs this reasonable?\r\n\r\nShould we loop through yarnhaips in all three until the correct node address and port number are returned\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n你好，我想反馈个使用情况，我配置的yarnHaIps 是ha 三个节点，\r\nresourceManagerHttpAddressPort 配置的是8080端口，\r\n公司集群的active节点端口是8080，但是standby的节点是8088，\r\n我只能配置一个端口号，当我用http://yarnIp1:%s/ws/v1/cluster/apps/%s时候\r\n如果请求的是个standby的节点，函数HttpUtils.get(url) 返回的是null字符串，\r\n会直接导致任务调用成功，但是ds里任务状态会返回失败，\r\n这个情况是否合理呢？\r\n是不是应该当循环遍历yarnHaIps在三个都遍历完直到返回正确的节点地址和端口号的地址\n\n### Use case\n\n通过配置的yarnHaIps节点数量一直循环到配置的节点返回正确结果\r\nCycle through the number of configured yarnhaips nodes until the configured nodes return the correct results\n\n### Related issues\n\n_No response_\n\n### Are you willing to submit a PR?\n\n- [X] Yes I am willing to submit a
