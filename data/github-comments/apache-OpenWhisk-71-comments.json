Personally, I don't even like the idea that they have to know the feed action is a web action, but that seems unavoidable.\r\n\r\n It is much simpler to tell them to use (for example) `--web -f messageHubFeed` and have the CLI handle the sticky details of determining the correct URL for them. If we were to require them to pass in the feed action URL, then the documentation for the feed gets much trickier in that we can't just say \"use these parameters\" and will then have to document how to find the URL for the feed action and pass _that_ as a parameter.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I doubt most users that have created a trigger even realize there is an action invocation happening on their behalf - and that is a good thing. They _should_ be able to create triggers without having a detailed understanding of all the work being done for them by the feed.\r\n\r\nAlso, something just feels icky about allowing them to pass an arbitrary URL to which we are going to POST their feed details.

Do you think it makes sense to discuss this on the mailing list to get broader attention? It would be interesting to understand the history better (why early prototypes implemented this approach and why it was abandoned). Also, I think it would be a good discussion to look at use cases other than public cloud (i.e. private OW deployments). Reason I mention that: that might render moot some of the complexity arguments above.\r\nReally don't know the outcome of such a discussion - but I think it's really worth having it and have it go
