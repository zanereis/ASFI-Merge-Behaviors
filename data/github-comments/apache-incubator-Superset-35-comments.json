The first make the usability of Caravel worst, the second just make updating a pain (from pip install --upgrade to having the need to merge, test, compile, check it works).

I'm not saying we should make it a kitchen sink, but i don't see why we cannot add the useful ones, like the one you mentioned, before thinking of making it configurable. Do you have many more that you cannot share?\n\nMy personal opinion is I don't see anything wrong maintaining our own forks (more like branches anyway) for our production. I maintain one for my employer, airbnb has their branches pushed to the repo. Mine is a commit that was stable plus 4 backported patches. If they become stale or unmaintained that's not an upstream problem. Adding configuration over code makes it easier for every downstream to sit on their stable releases and don't give a damn about upstream stabilization and development. As a free software developer i hate that :)\nFinally i don't think updating caravel is so demanding, the only annoying bits is building js taking ages, but the rest is easy and documented, the real problem is fixing regression and make sure they are not introduced. That's the hard part for everyone so better if it's shared by many parties :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/249417536/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/249428481","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/1188#issuecomment-249428481","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/1188","id":249428481,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0OTQyODQ4MQ==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-25T15:37:56Z","updated_at":"2016-09-25T15:37:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I understand the rational for this, but I agree with @xrmx on this one.

I saw in Master the code for adding DataSources but it doesn't seem to be ready yet.\nAs for your question, well, week is a good example. The starting day of the week could change from company to company, usuall choices are Sunday or Monday and slightly less common Saturday. Plus the databases are sometimes a little bit strange (e.g: HP Vertica uses Monday or Sunday depending on the function you use). And you are not even considering the problem of converting Timezones, now in Caravel everything is in UTC. I think these area need a little bit of attention, this configuration was a small piece to make it better, but these are the areas that need a little bit of attention:\n- Config of Granularities for SQL datasource, I agree, inheritance is a more general solution\n- Better Granularities for Druid: right now Caravel support only duration with an optional time origin. But Druid provides also support for Period Granularities that work betters in most cases (especially if you are using Druid for analytics use over long periods)\n- Time Zone support: we have a patch ready that covers Druid datasources but we are not sure to submit it because it touches several point in the code base. I think it would make sense to add it when the code is refactored. Incidentally, in Druid timezones requires to use Period granularities instead of duration ones...\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/249434404/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/249436263","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/1188#issuecomment-249436263","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/1188","id":249436263,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0OTQzNjI2Mw==","user":{"login":"xrmx","id":12932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx","html_url":"https://github.com/xrmx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-25T18:06:37Z","updated_at":"2016-09-25T18:06:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Il 25/09/2016 19:29, Luca Albertalli ha scritto:\n\n> @xrmx https://github.com/xrmx sorry, I think you misunderstood my point.

Behind the scenes, SQLAlchemy uses the driver to get the table schema. As you could see from the error message it is trying to inspect the table schema using the table pg_catalog, that is Postgres, instead of v_catalog.\n\nVertica uses PostgreSQL syntax but changed the table name for the schema. The driver you are using still uses the Postgres function to perform the schema reflection and it fails. You probably need to patch the driver. In my case was just one function missing. Since the driver you are using comes from the same ancestor that I used, maybe my patch could help you. Try to look at the diff if it helps. https://github.com/jamescasbon/vertica-sqlalchemy/compare/master...shopkick:master\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/249782851/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/249806523","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/1200#issuecomment-249806523","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/1200","id":249806523,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0OTgwNjUyMw==","user":{"login":"xrmx","id":12932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx","html_url":"https://github.com/xrmx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-27T08:56:37Z","updated_at":"2016-09-27T08:56:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"You are missing your database dependencies:\nhttp://airbnb.io/caravel/installation.html#database-dependencies\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/249806523/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
