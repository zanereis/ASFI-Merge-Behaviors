Put another way: what would be the impact of simply overriding `write(byte[] buf, int offset, int length)` on that shim `OutputStream`?\r\n\r\n`writeStrRaw` is basically equivalent to both the `gen.writeRawValue(String)` and `gen.writeRaw(String)` methods. The distinction between `writeRawValue()` and `writeRaw()` is I think a bit of an impedance mismatch between Solr's `TextWriter` API and the Jackson `JsonGenerator` API -- the clue is in the no-op methods for writing separators in `WriterImpl` in this PR, and I think the consequence is that because we're no-opping those, we should _always_ use `gen.writeRawValue()` from the context of Solr. Related: I also note that `gen.writeRawValue(String)` says nothing about wrapping Strings in quotes -- in fact the `gen.writeRawValue()` methods don't know the type context at all, so I think that may requires a change in the else clause of `writeStr()`, to:\r\n```java\r\n    public void writeStr(String name, String val, boolean needsEscaping) throws IOException {\r\n      if (needsEscaping) {\r\n        gen.writeString(val);\r\n      } else {\r\n        gen.writeRawValue(\"\\\"\");\r\n        gen.writeRaw(val);\r\n        gen.writeRaw(\"\\\"\");\r\n     }\r\n    }\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1462597683/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1463059638","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1446#issuecomment-1463059638","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1446","id":1463059638,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5XNIS2","user":{"login":"uvatbc","id":8391225,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzOTEyMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8391225?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uvatbc","html_url":"https://github.com/uvatbc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uvatbc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uvatbc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uvatbc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uvatbc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uvatbc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uvatbc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uvatbc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uvatbc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uvatbc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-10T01:10:33Z","updated_at":"2023-03-10T01:10:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hm.

Alex, thanks for the PR!\r\n\r\nA few comments/questions on the v2 endpoints themselves (since you summarized them in a comment above):\r\n\r\n1. Does this PR change any of the API responses (for those APIs which preexisted this PR?  It doesn't look like it (which is good), but just wanted to double check.\r\n2. I'm a little ambivalent about the response for `GET /api/aliases/aName/properties/foo` (which looks to be an API that's brand new to this PR?).  Do we need to include `\"property\": \"foo\"` - presumably the user already knows which replica property they requested?  I don't feel strongly in either direction here, just wondering aloud...\r\n3. Does the v2 code need to support \"deleting\" a property via empty-string?  It legitimately may because of the way that the v1 code is now structured to call into v2.  But it'd be a nice thing to avoid bringing into v2, since v2 has an explicit DELETE API for that purpose now.\r\n\r\nThat's all on the endpoints.  Will leave comments on the code itself inline.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1469818743/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1470024729","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1256#issuecomment-1470024729","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1256","id":1470024729,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5XnswZ","user":{"login":"epugh","id":22395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh","html_url":"https://github.com/epugh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-15T13:36:13Z","updated_at":"2023-03-15T13:36:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I wish Crave was running these tests ;-)   It's gotten in that weird state, and I'm nervous about messing with git to try and fix it...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1470024729/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1470094543","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1452#issuecomment-1470094543","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1452","id":1470094543,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5Xn9zP","user":{"login":"gerlowskija","id":9030708,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMzA3MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9030708?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija","html_url":"https://github.com/gerlowskija","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-15T14:19:32Z","updated_at":"2023-03-15T14:19:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've added some unit tests to cover the testing gap.

answer the questions you posted:\r\n\r\n\r\n> Does this PR change any of the API responses (for those APIs which preexisted this PR? It doesn't look like it (which is good), but just wanted to double check.\r\n\r\nhmm. I did not touch the v1 apis, but I did remove the v2 collections support. let me know if this was not the right decision\r\n\r\n> I'm a little ambivalent about the response for GET /api/aliases/aName/properties/foo (which looks to be an API that's brand new to this PR?). Do we need to include \"property\": \"foo\" - presumably the user already knows which replica property they requested? I don't feel strongly in either direction here, just wondering aloud...\r\n\r\nI think I agree to remove it. you are right, doesn't feel like it's adding too much value\r\n\r\n> Does the v2 code need to support \"deleting\" a property via empty-string? It legitimately may because of the way that the v1 code is now structured to call into v2. But it'd be a nice thing to avoid bringing into v2, since v2 has an explicit DELETE API for that purpose now.\r\n\r\nI'm using much of the preexisting code, it might not be possible to change the apis to this level. plus if you are using the bulk property update, there would be no way to remove more properties in one go.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1470566279/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1470828417","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1360#issuecomment-1470828417","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1360","id":1470828417,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5Xqw-B","user":{"login":"dsmiley","id":377295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzI5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/377295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley","html_url":"https://github.com/dsmiley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-15T20:55:25Z","updated_at":"2023-03-15T20:55:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"No

It seems like that is made so that cores can be moved between nodes...\r\n\r\nThank you for the raising the concern @HoustonPutman , I was not aware of such option! From my brief search the reference on `ZkController#genericCoreNodeNames`/`cloudConfig.getGenericCoreNodeNames()`, it only appears to affect the result of `getCoreNodeName`. So I assume the `Replica#getNodeName` (read from the state.json, which `genericCoreNodeNames` should not matter?) would still be a mismatch to the `ZkController#getNodeName`.\r\n\r\nHowever, ur concern does lead me to think deeper on several scenarios, which I think would be great if you can provide some insights:\r\n1. From `genericCoreNodeNames`, it mentions the case of `When a different machine takes over serving that core things will be much easier to understand.`. I assume all replica modes should be done via admin APIs (ie MOVESHARD/REPLACENODE) etc, which should update the state.json accordingly. Do we support some other forms of moves? like physically moving the folders around and expect Solr to detect the change and \"self correct\" the state.json? My approach assumes that if state.json is incorrect, we should not attempt to self-correct it, but I could have misunderstood some of the designs 😓 \r\n2. What about node name changes on a host? For example if we used to pass IP as `-Dhost` but now with the hostname, should we assume that Solr would start up fine and state.json will be \"self-corrected\"?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1481678376/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1482259248","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1484#issuecomment-1482259248","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1484","id":1482259248,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5YWXsw","user":{"login":"dsmiley","id":377295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzI5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/377295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley","html_url":"https://github.com/dsmiley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-24T05:08:46Z","updated_at":"2023-03-24T05:08:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"CHANGES.txt suggestion as an Improvement (JIRA also shows as Improvement):\r\n\r\n* SOLR-11685: When SolrCloud shard leaders change while indexing updates arrive, Solr could fail and return\r\n  a HTTP 503 status.

I'm debugging more to clarify the impact of the bug with only this change, and very likely another bug for a more general case that would probably deserve another JIRA or we fold into this one to clarify the messaging to users.\r\n\r\nI could imagine a test we could beast that induces ZooKeeper session losses and thus Solr side shard leadership changes while indexing is coming in, constantly checking if each doc _actually_ makes it.

The part I struggled with is that it randomly picks between `wt` JavaBin, Json, and XML, so I created SolrClients using the builder for each one.  Those can be pointed at specific nodes...     I just tweaked the Javadocs a bit to try and better explain:\r\n\r\n```\r\n   * returns a random SolrClient -- either a CloudSolrClient, or an HttpSolrClient pointed at a node\r\n   * in our cluster.

Especially assuming that @dsmiley's suggestion to dynamically avoid wrapping in UninvertingReader pans out, then iiuc the only thing that this PR offers that the schema-version-based approach does not is the ability to _forbid_ uninversion, and the ability to configure uninversion behavior independent of schema version (e.g., if someone wanted to forbid uninversion _and_ use schema version 1.5?). I'm leaning toward thinking that those differences are not enough to justify the extra complexity of the approach taken here.\r\n\r\nAre there any other reasons to prefer configuration via `solr.xml`?
