Thank you very much for the detailed review. I understand your point now, and agree that I’ve made a big assumption in my investigation that the Rest Catalog was NOT the Auth Server.\r\n\r\nI am glad we are still open to the change, because I can see how folks (including myself) would be inclined to use an existing, separate Auth Service to avoid having to store and maintain user credentials as a part of the Rest Catalog.\r\n\r\nRegarding the change needed in the Rest Catalog OpenAPI Spec: I think we would need to somehow mark the [/v1/oauth/tokens](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/25c8e19aed58623b680121bf1ed276452c6aed0f/open-api/rest-catalog-open-api.yaml#L132) endpoint to be ‘optional’. The rest of the endpoints will work as is, because in the authorization workflow with the external Auth Server, we also already have a bearer token attached to the Auth Header on the requests to the other endpoints. \r\n\r\nGiven that the [global security section](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/25c8e19aed58623b680121bf1ed276452c6aed0f/open-api/rest-catalog-open-api.yaml#L60) already has support for both OAuth2 and BearerAuth types, would adding additional documentation to /v1/oauth/tokens endpoint be enough, or is there a better way to communicate that the endpoint is optional?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1694758682/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1694770146","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/1601#issuecomment-1694770146","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1601","id":1694770146,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85lBCPi","user":{"login":"RussellSpitzer","id":413025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/413025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer","html_url":"https://github.com/RussellSpitzer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-27T21:52:27Z","updated_at":"2023-08-27T21:53:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@atifiu Cross reference the docs with the procedures in the spark 3.4 directory, if any are missing let's add them","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1694770146/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1694807478","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/6961#issuecomment-1694807478","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/6961","id":1694807478,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85lBLW2","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-28T00:11:07Z","updated_at":"2023-08-28T00:11:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has been open for 180 days with no activity.

Let me trry to answer the questions then.\r\n\r\n> I'd like to highlight some areas where we could potentially improve.\r\n> \r\n> 1. If we choose to filter out some nested field, pyarrow_to_schema will fail even with ignore_unprojectable_fields = True.\r\n\r\nThis was a bug to be addressed, and I just pushed the fix.  Could you take a look?\r\n\r\n> 2. May be we can let pyarrow_to_schema take the complete table schema rather than projected schema. In this way, we can focus on dealing with fields that are missing in the table schema and let\r\n> https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/91161185ce53abbaaee992ebc1d412052e87852b/python/pyiceberg/io/pyarrow.py#L773\r\n>    handle the unselected columns.\r\n\r\nActually what `pyarrow_to_schma` expects to get by `projected_schema` is a schema in the catalog (where I thought the word \"projected\" isn't so good in this context), and if what the \"complete table schema\" refers to is the catalog schema, its behavior should be pretty much the same as expected here.\r\n\r\n> 3.  If we have MapType whose key type is nested, pyarrow_to_schema will fail to switch to the correct inner schema when visiting MapType's value.\r\n\r\nThis should've been fixed along with 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1696747907/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1696757504","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/8393#issuecomment-1696757504","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/8393","id":1696757504,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85lIncA","user":{"login":"hililiwei","id":59213263,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MjEzMjYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59213263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei","html_url":"https://github.com/hililiwei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-29T04:45:28Z","updated_at":"2023-08-29T04:45:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @Fokko !","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1696757504/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1696855210","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/8389#issuecomment-1696855210","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/8389","id":1696855210,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85lI_Sq","user":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-29T06:38:14Z","updated_at":"2023-08-29T06:38:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"There is already a very simple check in place: https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/master/python/pyiceberg/schema.py#L1461-L1469\r\n\r\nWe can update this one, add some tests to verify that it works, and then it automatically available when doing the schema evolution.

As suggested to me by the previous comments by @RussellSpitzer  and @nastra , I had compared the schema between CDC and Iceberg tables. They match perfectly (This i compared by printing the schema of Iceberg, and comparing it with the schema of dataframe over cdc-jsons. In fact the  cdc-jsons were given the same schema file as that of Iceberg (the code is already pasted in my previous posts).\r\n\r\nAdded, I am also able to merge the json-CDC into the parquet snapshot using vanilla spark SQL without issues (i.e... without iceberg). Meaning I first dump the Mongo db into s3 as parqet files. Get the schema of these Mongo rows by scanning all the rows of mongodb (how? the config is pasted in my previous posts) and give the same schema to the json-cdc. Then Merge these 2 dataframes using vanilla spark sql --this works perfectly!\r\n\r\nWith the above, I strongly think it's not a schema issue. But my fellow mates on this forum still say it's a schema issue. So I am currently in catch-22 situation. \r\n\r\nThe only option I had was to add column by column and check where things break. But I have 719 columns and many of them are of complex datatypes (maps/ arrays/ maps with arrays with maps) --which means testing column by column is not practical. \r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1698473074/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1698501414","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/8392#issuecomment-1698501414","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/8392","id":1698501414,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85lPRMm","user":{"login":"manuzhang","id":1191767,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTE3Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1191767?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang","html_url":"https://github.com/manuzhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-30T05:09:50Z","updated_at":"2023-08-30T05:09:50Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@nastra @amogh-jahagirdar please take another look","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1698501414/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1699031934","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/8144#issuecomment-1699031934","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/8144","id":1699031934,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85lRSt-","user":{"login":"moriyoshi","id":18755,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NzU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18755?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/moriyoshi","html_url":"https://github.com/moriyoshi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moriyoshi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moriyoshi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moriyoshi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moriyoshi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moriyoshi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moriyoshi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moriyoshi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moriyoshi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moriyoshi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-30T12:02:06Z","updated_at":"2023-08-30T12:02:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@JonasJ-ap Can you have a look at this again?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1699031934/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1699311209","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/8414#issuecomment-1699311209","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/8414","id":1699311209,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85lSW5p","user":{"login":"nastra","id":271029,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MTAyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/271029?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra","html_url":"https://github.com/nastra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-30T14:38:04Z","updated_at":"2023-08-30T14:38:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"why do we need the backport?
