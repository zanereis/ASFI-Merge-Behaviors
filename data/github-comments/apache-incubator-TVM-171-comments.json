That is a very good question and I think there must be other people who have the same confusion as yours. So, I would like to tell the story in detail. \r\n\r\nThe PR https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/pull/4136 introduced the Tensor Core low-level intrinsic, which is tvm Tensor Core infrastructure. It enabled many different ways to use Tensor Core in TVM. This PR and https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/pull/4234 are exactly two ways.\r\n\r\nIn PR https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/pull/4234, it uses a pass `RewriteForTensorCore` to detect the Matmul pattern. (Please see RFC https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/issues/4105 for the details). The good thing is that users can write the normal matmul schedule and the pass will do the reset. However, this algorithm brings too many constraints:\r\n- The pass can only detect gemm pattern, but cannot support conv2d\r\n- This algorithm only supports one local fragment in a warp, which brings a great performance regression on large scale workloads. For a better understanding of this point, please see the CUTLASS  introduction (https://devblogs.nvidia.com/cutlass-linear-algebra-cuda/) Figure 7. It uses 2*4 local fragments in large scale gemm.\r\n\r\nAs we know, performance is the most important thing for schedules in topi. Hence, we directly use intrinsics rather than Auto Tensor Core CodeGen pass, the similar way as that shows in the tutorial (https://docs.tvm.ai/tutorials/optimize/opt_conv_tensorcore.html). The major differences are the following two things:\r\n- It enables traditional data layout (NHWC, and NCHW maybe in the future). The tutorial requires a packed layout(NHWCnc). We have done a lot of experience to choose the layout and achieved the best performance as we can. If you are interested in the details, @Shawn-Inspur may show it.\r\n- AutoTVM boosts the op calculation. Search space contains different local fragment numbers, different warp numbers in one block and different memory layout offset.

If we have a constant memory usage and do not do frequent alloc and free, perhaps we will be good by use an arena style allocator(which just allocs but do not free) and frees everything once we are done with the task.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to do a quick benchmark of the vmemory allocator vs alternatives(in terms of binary size and efficiency)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/602952533/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/602955714","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/5136#issuecomment-602955714","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5136","id":602955714,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwMjk1NTcxNA==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-24T01:34:11Z","updated_at":"2020-03-24T01:34:11Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks

I think it worth to think about memory allocation strategy.

This will completely eliminate the usage of system calls and allow the program o run in bare metal.\r\n\r\n\r\n@tqchen Removing all external allocator use and go with an embedded arena allocator sounds a little bit fishy.

The way it works is that we create a different arena for workspace, along with a counter.\r\n\r\n- When a memory is allocated, we allocate memory from the arena, and add the counter\r\n- When a memory is de-allocated, we decrease the counter\r\n- When the counter goes to zero, we free all the memory.\r\n\r\nThis will work because all workspace memory are temporal. It also guarantees a constant time allocation\r\n\r\nAs a generalization. If most memory allocation happens in a RAII style lifecycle. e.g. everything de-allocates onces we exit a scope, then the counter based strategy(per scope) is should work pretty well.\r\n\r\nI am not fixated about the arena allocator, but would like to challenge us to think a bit how much simpler can we make the allocation strategy looks like given what we know about the workload.

Very interesting and good questions to ask.\r\n\r\nFrom a design level point of view for micro-controllers I'd like to take this one step further and challenge folks to think about whether this can be achieved with static allocation rather than any form of dynamic allocation . The hypothesis being that at compile time one would know how much temporary space is needed between layers rather than having to face a run time failure.\r\n\r\nDynamic allocation on micro-controllers suffers from fragmentation issues and further do we want to have dynamic allocation in the runtime on micro-controllers.  Further the model being executed will be part of a larger application  - how can we allow our users to specify the amount of heap available or being consumed for executing their model ? It would be better to try to provide that with diagnostics at link time or compilation time rather than at runtime. @mshawcroft  might have more to add.  And yes, in our opinion for micro-controllers one of the challenges is the availability and usage of temporary storage for working set calculations between layers.\r\n\r\n2 further design questions. \r\n\r\n1.   In the micro-controller world, supporting every new device with their different memory maps and what not will be painful and beyond one simple reference implementation, I don't think we have an efficient route to deployment other than integrating with other platforms in the microcontroller space. How would this runtime integrate with other platforms like Zephyr, mbedOS or FreeRTOS ?\r\n \r\n2. I'd be interested in extending CI with qemu or some such for Cortex-M as well or indeed on the STM board that you are using @tmoreau89 .\r\n\r\nPurely a nit but from a rationale point of view, I would say that uTVM runtime not being tested in a CI is technical debt :)\r\n\r\nregards\r\nRamana","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/603408836/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/603427810","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/5131#issuecomment-603427810","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5131","id":603427810,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwMzQyNzgxMA==","user":{"login":"icemelon","id":2696494,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTY0OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2696494?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon","html_url":"https://github.com/icemelon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-24T18:23:28Z","updated_at":"2020-03-24T18:23:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@selo1412
