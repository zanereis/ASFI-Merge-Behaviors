I've tried that but am still having a similar issue. First for others, sqlite3 does not support alter removing columns, so I had to create a new table, copy the data over, remove the old table, then move the new table back by doing the following:\n\n```\nCREATE TABLE \"table_columns_new\" (\ncreated_on DATETIME NOT NULL,\nchanged_on DATETIME NOT NULL,\nid INTEGER NOT NULL,\ntable_id INTEGER,\ncolumn_name VARCHAR(255),\nis_dttm BOOLEAN,\nis_active BOOLEAN,\ntype VARCHAR(32),\ngroupby BOOLEAN,\ncount_distinct BOOLEAN,\nsum BOOLEAN,\nmax BOOLEAN,\nmin BOOLEAN,\nfilterable BOOLEAN,\ndescription TEXT,\ncreated_by_fk INTEGER,\nchanged_by_fk INTEGER,\nexpression TEXT,\nverbose_name VARCHAR(1024),\nPRIMARY KEY (id),\nCHECK (is_dttm IN (0, 1)),\nCHECK (is_active IN (0, 1)),\nCHECK (groupby IN (0, 1)),\nCHECK (count_distinct IN (0, 1)),\nCHECK (sum IN (0, 1)),\nCHECK (max IN (0, 1)),\nCHECK (min IN (0, 1)),\nCHECK (filterable IN (0, 1)),\nFOREIGN KEY(created_by_fk) REFERENCES ab_user (id),\nFOREIGN KEY(changed_by_fk) REFERENCES ab_user (id),\nFOREIGN KEY(table_id) REFERENCES tables (id)\n);\n\ninsert into table_columns_new select created_on, changed_on, id, table_id, column_name, is_dttm, is_active, type, groupby, count_distinct, sum, max, min, filterable, description, created_by_fk, changed_by_fk, expression, verbose_name from table_columns;\n\ndrop table table_columns;\n\nalter table table_columns_new rename to table_columns;\n```\n\nI then did a `caravel db upgrade` and a `caravel init`\n\nThe init gives me the following error: \n\n```\n2016-10-11 14:57:05,082:INFO:root:Creating
