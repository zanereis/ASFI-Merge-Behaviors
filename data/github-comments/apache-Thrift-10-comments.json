In any case: Happy to accept the contribution license.\n\nFor reference, these are the instructions for Github PRs:\n- Create a fork for http://github.com/apache/thrift\n- Create a branch for your changes(best practice is issue as branch name, e.g. THRIFT-9999)\n- Modify the source to include the improvement/bugfix\n- Remember to provide tests for all submited changes\n- When bugfixing: add test that will isolate bug before applying change that fixes it\n- Verify that you follow Thrift Coding Standards (you can run 'make style', which ensures proper format for some languages)\n- Verify that your change works on other platforms by adding a GitHub service hook to Travis CI and AppVeyor\n- Commit and push changes to your branch (please use issue name and description as commit title, e.g. THRIFT-9999 make it perfect)\n- Issue a pull request with the jira ticket number you are working on in it's name\n- Wait for other contributors or committers to review your new addition\n- Wait for a committer to commit your patch\n\nIt doesn't look like those are mentioning any licensing topics. Admittedly I ignored the JIRA parts because it felt like overkill for a small change.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/153830391/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/154406688","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/673#issuecomment-154406688","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/673","id":154406688,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NDQwNjY4OA==","user":{"login":"nsuke","id":3064114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjQxMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3064114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsuke","html_url":"https://github.com/nsuke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsuke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsuke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsuke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsuke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsuke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsuke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsuke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsuke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsuke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-06T13:17:09Z","updated_at":"2015-11-06T13:17:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi @phongphan, thank you for series of improvements !\nUnfortunately, I think I just broke your patch by Python3 commit.\nCould you rebase this and also take a look at my code comment ?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/154406688/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/154452471","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/673#issuecomment-154452471","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/673","id":154452471,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NDQ1MjQ3MQ==","user":{"login":"phongphan","id":1214735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQ3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phongphan","html_url":"https://github.com/phongphan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phongphan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phongphan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phongphan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phongphan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phongphan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phongphan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phongphan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phongphan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phongphan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-06T16:11:33Z","updated_at":"2015-11-06T16:11:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @nsuke, thanks for the comment.
