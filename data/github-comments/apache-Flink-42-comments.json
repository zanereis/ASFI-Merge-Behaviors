If you're behind a proxy then you probably already know how to work with it. There are also other ways to use a proxy with Git (e.g. external tools or operating system tools). Also, you're assuming a http proxy which is just one type of proxy. For example, it could also be a SOCKS proxy protocol. Furthermore, you're sending the username and password in plain text if you use this command. Depending on the network you're in, this could enable someone to steal your account data.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/121535828/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/121546219","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/906#issuecomment-121546219","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/906","id":121546219,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyMTU0NjIxOQ==","user":{"login":"gyfora","id":5880972,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODA5NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5880972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora","html_url":"https://github.com/gyfora","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-15T09:23:30Z","updated_at":"2015-07-15T09:23:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think the implementation looks good however I am concerned about the performance hit.\n\nWe need to make sure that we dont get this serious overhead when the job does not even need timestamps.

I'm not done yet but I found some points which are able to improve.\n\nFirst, there are some duplicated classes such as `SimpleFlatJoinFunction`, `MatchRemovingMatcher`, `Match`, `CollectionIterator`. I think that we can this classes move under `org.apache.flink.runtime.operators.testutils` package. After moving them, they can be shared with test cases for hash-based outer join.\n\nSecond, this is just my opinion, how about creating iterator classes for each outer join type such as, `AbstractMergeLeftOuterJoinIterator`, `AbstractMergeRightOuterJoinIterator`, `AbstractMergeFullOuterJoinIterator` and derived classes by reusing variable? I'm concerned about time consuming by comparing outer join type for many records in `callWithNextKey` method. The outer join type is already decided before doing join operation. But I'm not sure that there is obvious performance decrease by this comparing. If the performance decrease is negligible, the second suggestion could be ignored.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/122376238/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/122379328","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/710#issuecomment-122379328","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/710","id":122379328,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyMjM3OTMyOA==","user":{"login":"sachingoel0101","id":8874261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NzQyNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8874261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101","html_url":"https://github.com/sachingoel0101","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-17T19:15:16Z","updated_at":"2015-07-17T19:15:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The changes proposed by Theodore in the PR #861 have been incorporated here too.

only problem with assuming NullValue if a value is missing is that we can't return NullValue in place of VV.\nI mean to say Graph<K, VV, EV> in this VV or EV can't be NullValue. otherwise that was what I was originally going for. \nMaybe since any of the other methods to create DataSet/Graph don't provide a method to give EdgeValue as NullValue and just expect the user to map it (at least that is what I saw), maybe we could just remove the functionality. I had only added it since many examples seemed to use it so I thought it would be nice to have that functionality. \nIn any case we can just keep one typesNullEdge method too because if they don't want that, they can use normal overloaded types, 3 arguments for no NullValue, 2 arguments for null vertex and 1 argument for null vertex and edge and just one method named typesNullEdge to tell that only edges have NullValue.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/123057981/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/123153943","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/892#issuecomment-123153943","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/892","id":123153943,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyMzE1Mzk0Mw==","user":{"login":"andralungu","id":2550549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTA1NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2550549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu","html_url":"https://github.com/andralungu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-21T04:33:17Z","updated_at":"2015-07-21T04:33:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @shghatge ,\n\nDid you also run the two examples on the cluster to make sure that the approximate version is faster?\nThen you could also add some numbers to the two PRs.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/123153943/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/123212399","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/925#issuecomment-123212399","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/925","id":123212399,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyMzIxMjM5OQ==","user":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-21T08:30:40Z","updated_at":"2015-07-21T08:30:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Is it bad that the accumulators are not serialized in a local setup?
