This is due to over relaxation we made when handling division where there is little information available (always round down by 1). A improvement can be made to the detector when the other side can be proven to be dividable.

I started implementing. I found out that the difference between \"auto_tensorize\" and autoinline is that the latter can always be done or all the conditions of the possibility of the transformation can be checked during schedule/stage transformation. While in the former, some of the conditions need to be checked during lowering. Therefore, for the former, I can't decide which loops to mark as `kTensorized` during schedule transformation. Am I missing something?\r\nOne way to solve this problem is that we make `tensorize` mark everything as `kTensorized` and make `MakeTensorize` smarter to look for tensorization opportunities in all loops of a loopnest.

Seems like the problem happens in `RebaseNonZeroMinLoop()` (which is called by `Schedule::normalize()`). Here is the initial part of `RebaseNonZeroMinLoop()`.\r\n```c++\r\nvoid RebaseNonZeroMinLoop(const Schedule& sch) {\r\n  std::unordered_map<IterVar, IterVar> rebase_map;\r\n  for (Stage s : sch->stages) {\r\n    if (s->attach_type == kInlinedAlready) continue;\r\n\r\n    auto root_iter_vars = s->op->root_iter_vars();\r\n    ArrayNode* leaf_vars = s->leaf_iter_vars.CopyOnWrite();\r\n    for (IterVar iv : root_iter_vars) {\r\n      size_t idx = FindNodeRef(leaf_vars, iv);\r\n      auto it  = s->iter_var_attrs.find(iv);\r\n      // don;t need to rebase path that are binded.\r\n      if (it != s->iter_var_attrs.end() &&\r\n          (*it).second->bind_thread.defined()) {\r\n        continue;\r\n      }\r\n      if (idx < leaf_vars->data.size()) {\r\n        // insert rebase\r\n        IterVar rebased = IterVarNode::make(\r\n            Range(), iv->var.copy_with_suffix(\"\"), iv->iter_type);\r\n        s->relations.push_back(RebaseNode::make(iv, rebased));\r\n        if (s->iter_var_attrs.count(iv)) {\r\n          s->iter_var_attrs.Set(rebased, s->iter_var_attrs.at(iv));\r\n        }\r\n        leaf_vars->data[idx] = rebased.node_;\r\n        rebase_map[iv] = rebased;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n/* the rest of the method */\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor the specific test case above, what happens is that before `RebaseNonZeroLoop`, there is a stage (call it `s1`) in which both `leaf_iter_vars` and `all_iter_vars` refer to the same pair of `IterVar`s.\r\nAfter the loop above that goes over the stages, stage `s1` is modified as follows: Each of the two `IterVar`s of `leaf_iter_vars` are replaced by another newly created `IterVar` ([see this line](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/8a3dbd7971a3d7df7c3a728d18c7c6124bf68989/src/schedule/schedule_dataflow_rewrite.cc#L258). However, the two `IterVar`s in `s1.all_iter_vars` stay as before. Therefore, `all_iter_vars` end up referring to two different pairs of `IterVar`s causing problems later on.\r\nIt seems to me that the solution is to make the `IterVar` replacement everywhere in the stage when we replace it in `leaf_iter_vars`. How can this be done properly?\r\n\r\nThis is related to #738 in the sense that we have stale `IterVar`s here and there, AFAIK, we have stale tensors.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/355126312/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/355135513","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/738#issuecomment-355135513","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/738","id":355135513,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NTEzNTUxMw==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-03T21:42:03Z","updated_at":"2018-01-03T21:42:24Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"fixed
