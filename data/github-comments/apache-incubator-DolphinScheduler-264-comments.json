Reason:\r\n java.lang.IllegalStateException: No Executor found. Please make sure to export the HADOOP_CLASSPATH environment variable or have hadoop in your classpath. For more information refer to the \"Deployment\" section of the official Apache Flink documentation. [0m\r\n \r\n Shutting down the session...\r\n done.\n\n### What you expected to happen\n\nWrite a more detailed flinksql scheduling process, including the version of flink and the required environment\n\n### How to reproduce\n\nCreate three tables in MySQL with the same fields, insert data into two tables, and then write flinksql. Similarly, create three identical tables and associate them with the mysql table. Then query the two tables with data and insert them into the third table without data. Such flinksql After writing, put it on the dolphin scheduler for scheduling\n\n### Anything else\n\nIs dolphin scheduling flink a flink that only supports on yarn deployment? Does kubernetes deployment support scheduling?\n\n### Version\n\n3.0.0-beta-2\n\n### Are you willing to submit PR?\n\n- [X] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to

I think the development cost of this way for new contributors is much higher than that before. We should try to reduce the learning cost of development.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, thank you for the review suggestion you gave me, I admit that I increased the complexity of the development, I also felt this way when writing this demo, but I think it is necessary because it allows new contributions Those who know the interface definition method of each API, build test cases according to the interface definition method, instead of looking at the interface documentation or the corresponding controller code, I will add interface descriptions and corresponding links to each API interface definition later. Make the use of each API clearer for contributors\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, API testing does not completely depend on API developers, and my current method conforms to the process of interface development. First define the interface to implement the interface method, and initialize the corresponding interface factory when writing test cases. The purpose of this interface factory It is also used for API+UI testing later. I know that although API developers may have the feeling of rewriting the interface, I think it is necessary","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1176975616/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1176979353","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/pull/10817#issuecomment-1176979353","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/10817","id":1176979353,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms5GJ0eZ","user":{"login":"SbloodyS","id":17822915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODIyOTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17822915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SbloodyS","html_url":"https://github.com/SbloodyS","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SbloodyS/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SbloodyS/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SbloodyS/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SbloodyS/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SbloodyS/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SbloodyS/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SbloodyS/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SbloodyS/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SbloodyS/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-07T02:39:46Z","updated_at":"2022-07-07T02:39:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@kezhenxu94
