come back to this and an attempt to summarise…\n- the client-side cleanup takes priority, this is rather obvious. that is done via brave and tickets for further work can exist against it, [client-A], although one might argue it is already done,\n- the idea of sharing java interfaces, or having the scala client libraries in this repo built upon the brave interfaces, can be left for another day until the community sees it fit and has momentum there, [client-B]\n- the server-side zipkin needs to be java-friendly, to the point that extensions can be written without having to code scala, [server-A]\n- the server-side zipkin is to remain at large a scala implementation, with primarily scala written extensions, [!server-B]\n- simply replacing scala traits to java interfaces does not solve (server-A),  https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/45, that is (server-A2) is the correct approach.\n\nFeel free to jump in and correct this summary.\n\nBased off this i would say that the unresolved issue is, because it sits in the server-side project and it has been confirmed that making the server project more friendly to writing pure java extensions is a need, about (server-A), specifically (server-A2). But beyond that we can and should reassure and clarify to everyone that there will be no big migration of the server over to java, ie (server-B).\n\nGiven the length of the discussion in this issue i suggest…\n- re-titling this issue as \"_Discuss_ eliminating dependency on Scala compiler and runtime\" and closing it (given everyone agrees with the summary),\n- closing https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/451 since it's about (server-A1) which is wrong, \n- open a new issue (in this project) for (server-A2) \"Rewrite zipkin-common to java so third-party extensions can be pure java)\". While this doesn't do everything we want it's a step in the right direction with well defined limited scope and goal. Hopefully not all of the hurdles and concerns listed in Adrian's comment here https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/451#issuecomment-122303113 are relevant if we limit the scope to just zipkin-common?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/127188811/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/127271678","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/463#issuecomment-127271678","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/463","id":127271678,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNzI3MTY3OA==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-03T15:04:34Z","updated_at":"2015-08-03T15:04:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think we should keep this open or move it to a new repo.

The current scala/finagle one is desired by active contributors including @eirslett and @kristofa \n\nTo allow mutual progress, a pure-server backend should start in its own repository under openzipkin. This repo will focus on allowing JVM backends to be written without a dependency on a specific scala runtime, directly or indirectly. For example, it wouldn't require configuration to be written in scala, nor would accident of thrift serialization end up requiring finagle. It wouldn't focus on ancillary sharing activities, such as attempts to get instrumentation to share the same libraries (like context propagation). It is very important that such a project has a narrow and solvable mission.\n\nI'd expect key stakeholders to be those who've raised their hands before.. at least @b @jpinner @NiteshKant @dsyer @spencergibb. If folks have a good idea for a repo name besides java-zipkin, or if you wish collaborate, raise your hand!\n\nI'll create the repo sometime in the next week and offer to help draft initial
