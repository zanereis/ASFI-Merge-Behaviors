Though I get the general appeal of just sending out information once and then using it multiple times — for example for logs and traces.\r\n\r\nSince you already seem to have Filebeat -> Kafka our general approach would then be Logstash to get the data to Elasticsearch for logging and you might be able to forward the data to Zipkin for tracing as well. There is a community plugin for a [Logstash to Zipkin output](https://github.com/whitemerry/logstash-output-zipkin); while it seems to be unfinished that would be a good approach in general. We see it pretty much as a feature that the Beats only have a single output (at the moment) and for any further distribution and splitting you'd use Logstash — optionally with a queue in between.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/385207275/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/385217159","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/2031#issuecomment-385217159","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2031","id":385217159,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NTIxNzE1OQ==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-29T01:04:33Z","updated_at":"2018-04-29T01:04:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"thanks..
