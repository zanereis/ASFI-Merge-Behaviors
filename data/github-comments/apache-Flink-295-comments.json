Before starting the review, I first have a few high level questions. When reading the corresponding JIRA issue, the issue was mainly about making the `OptionsFactory` configurable in the flink-configuration. In contrast to that, this PR does not make `OptionsFactory` configurable, but instead exposes some partibular RocksDB specific options, e.g. compaction style. While this approach might be more comfortable for users, it is also less flexible/powerful than the approach described in the JIRA. So what that in mind I wonder if we could not do the following: \r\n- make the `OptionsFactory` configurable in the configuration.\r\n- provide a default implementation of `OptionsFactory` that is based on (or using) the functionality that you currently have in `RocksDBCustomizedOptions` und can also be extended by the user. That means, this default factory will react to the setting defined in this PR.\r\n\r\nWith this, i) the user can easily configure particular options (like compaction) as with your current PR, but ii) they can also completely override the `OptionsFactory` in the flink config, e.g. because they need another option that we do not cover, and iii) they can extend the easy & flexible by extending the default factory. The default factory without anything configured will just use predifined options and keep them untouched. What do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/461428217/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/461428878","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/7555#issuecomment-461428878","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/7555","id":461428878,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MTQyODg3OA==","user":{"login":"greghogan","id":569655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2OTY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/569655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan","html_url":"https://github.com/greghogan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-07T13:57:43Z","updated_at":"2019-02-07T13:57:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@leesf we may want to retain a short message while increasing the detail or specificity.
