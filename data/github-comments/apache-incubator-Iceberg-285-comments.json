Unfortunately, it is a bit controversial. There is no way to express task affinity in Spark, only locality. The best option for us is to implement what `KafkaRDD` does. The problem is that it only works well if dynamic allocation is disabled. Even without that, this feature should be useful. The change to assign tasks for the same partition to one executor is around 20 lines of code.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1754147825/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1754148814","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/8755#issuecomment-1754148814","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/8755","id":1754148814,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85oji_O","user":{"login":"singhpk234","id":35593236,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NTkzMjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35593236?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhpk234","html_url":"https://github.com/singhpk234","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhpk234/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhpk234/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhpk234/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhpk234/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhpk234/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhpk234/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhpk234/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhpk234/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhpk234/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-10T01:03:54Z","updated_at":"2023-10-10T01:03:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @aokolnychyi looking forward to it :) !","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1754148814/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1754155151","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/8755#issuecomment-1754155151","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/8755","id":1754155151,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85ojkiP","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-10T01:12:18Z","updated_at":"2023-10-10T01:12:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I tested this PR on a cluster a bit.

I was wondering if tagging was required to get this functionality. Sounds to me that the answer to that it is not.\r\n\r\nThank you for your feedback. I will be keeping an eye on for #8553 and trying it out when/if it gets released.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1757017829/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1757029634","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/8797#issuecomment-1757029634","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/8797","id":1757029634,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85ouiUC","user":{"login":"nastra","id":271029,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MTAyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/271029?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra","html_url":"https://github.com/nastra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-11T07:38:35Z","updated_at":"2023-10-11T07:38:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"can

we have a keyless table, and we have multiple rows with the exact same values in the table, then if we receive a `-D`, `-U` record, then equality delete will remove both occurrences of the given row. Which would be problematic, as only a single row should be removed in this case.\r\n\r\nSo supporting keyless Apache Flink tables is not a feature which could be easily accomplished with the current architecture.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1757039591/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1757050434","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/8754#issuecomment-1757050434","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/8754","id":1757050434,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85ounZC","user":{"login":"pvary","id":19705742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzA1NzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19705742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary","html_url":"https://github.com/pvary","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-11T07:52:25Z","updated_at":"2023-10-11T07:52:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> > > * Is the streaminig feature associated with icebergs tagging features?
