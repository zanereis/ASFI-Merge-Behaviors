The implementation of this SIP should iterate toward deprecating the React-Bootstrap dependency, in favor of bespoke components with custom LESS styles built around this new design system.\r\n\r\nI'm curious if it would make sense to move to a more modern CSS in JS approach for styling components. This supports a shared `theme` object for fonts, colors, sizing, etc., while encapsulating and co-locating specific styles to individual components. This tends to mitigate the risk of bloated css over time which occurs because it's very difficult to isolate and remove `class-name`-based styles. [Lunar](https://github.com/airbnb/lunar) ([demo](https://airbnb.io/lunar/)) is an example of such a library, we could consider it.\r\n\r\n> in favor of bespoke components with custom LESS styles\r\n\r\nBy this phrasing do you mean **not** using any component library (like react bootstrap)? I would note that it is a **significant** amount of work to write a component library from scratch, even if components are replaced individually one at a time. \r\n\r\n> All changes, in the design and implementation of new components, should be \"atomic\" in nature, steering toward a more unified design/component system, targeting reusability and consistency.\r\n\r\nI generally agree with this, but it seems worthwhile to align on a more specific component library or approach for new / implemented components in this SIP. If there is ambiguity, there might be a variety of libraries / frameworks introduced, or if it is unclear what to use Bootstrap 3 might continue to be used.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/575286859/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/575296136","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/8790#issuecomment-575296136","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/8790","id":575296136,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NTI5NjEzNg==","user":{"login":"nickchoate","id":20990921,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTkwOTIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20990921?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickchoate","html_url":"https://github.com/nickchoate","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickchoate/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickchoate/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickchoate/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickchoate/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickchoate/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickchoate/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickchoate/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickchoate/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickchoate/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-16T19:01:29Z","updated_at":"2020-01-16T19:01:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@dpgaspar Increasing the memory helped move past the npm build step that was failing, however I am now getting a new error.

In the backend, I think it should be handled as upstream as possible (2). So here `viz.py` makes sense, and should probably also be added here: https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/master/superset/common/query_object.py#L82 By doing this, we ensure that dupes are never present in query objects, hence the problem doesn't need to be addressed in (3). Another option would be to raise an exception in (2) if there are dupes, but that feels excessively picky towards the frontend.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/575870949/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/575924145","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/8960#issuecomment-575924145","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/8960","id":575924145,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NTkyNDE0NQ==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-18T18:05:54Z","updated_at":"2020-01-22T19:20:44Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8960?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#8960](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8960?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/commit/e46ff239afc79af5753cfe82779fa87796f46a27?src=pr&el=desc) will **not change** coverage.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8960/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=KsB0fHcx6l&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8960?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@           Coverage Diff           @@\n##           master    #8960   +/-   ##\n=======================================\n  Coverage   59.16%   59.16%           \n=======================================\n  Files         367      367           \n  Lines       11679    11679           \n  Branches     2862     2862           \n=======================================\n  Hits         6910     6910           \n  Misses       4590     4590           \n  Partials      179      179\n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8960?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [...rset/assets/src/dashboard/actions/sliceEntities.js](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8960/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-c3VwZXJzZXQvYXNzZXRzL3NyYy9kYXNoYm9hcmQvYWN0aW9ucy9zbGljZUVudGl0aWVzLmpz) | `9.67% <ø> (ø)` | :arrow_up: |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8960?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8960?src=pr&el=footer).

Is there a reason superset doesn't include group by for big number query? I see a cypress test that checks it is not there... and it would seem pretty easy to add BigNumber.js under controls just add the 'groupby' to the query controls. I forked the repo and tested this out and it works... were there some side effects that caused you to remove the groupby from the control set for big number?\r\n\r\nI second the above question. could any body elaborate on the reasons?\r\n\r\n@timurista - could you share your code with the changes? that would be helpful, as I'm trying to make sense of superset code and change to suit my usecases","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/576178360/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/576180545","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/1523#issuecomment-576180545","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/1523","id":576180545,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NjE4MDU0NQ==","user":{"login":"darshanajr","id":4464657,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NjQ2NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4464657?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/darshanajr","html_url":"https://github.com/darshanajr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darshanajr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darshanajr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darshanajr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darshanajr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darshanajr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darshanajr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darshanajr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darshanajr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darshanajr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-20T09:17:20Z","updated_at":"2020-01-20T09:17:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Is this functionality being implemented?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/576180545/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/576207785","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/1523#issuecomment-576207785","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/1523","id":576207785,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NjIwNzc4NQ==","user":{"login":"darshanajr","id":4464657,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NjQ2NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4464657?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/darshanajr","html_url":"https://github.com/darshanajr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darshanajr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darshanajr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darshanajr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darshanajr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darshanajr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darshanajr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darshanajr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darshanajr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darshanajr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-20T10:25:16Z","updated_at":"2020-01-20T10:30:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"![ordering not working](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4464657/72718399-e3709f80-3b9b-11ea-9d3b-25f8c5d7151a.JPG)\r\n\r\nIf I click the ordering icon in the top right corner of the chart, it will order.
