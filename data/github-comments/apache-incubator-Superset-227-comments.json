The results are based on 46 responses.\r\n\r\n**Q1. Imagine you had data for the entire month of January (encoded as dates, e.g. 2019-01-01). Which of the following intervals make most sense?**\r\n\r\n- `[start, end]`: e.g. `[2019-01-01, 2019-01-31]` **89.1%**\r\n- `[start, end)`: e.g. `[2019-01-01, 2019-02-01)` **10.9%**\r\n- `(start, end]`: e.g. `(2018-12-31, 2019-01-31]` **0%**\r\n- `(start, end)`: e.g. `(2019-12-31, 2019-02-01)` **0%**\r\n\r\n**Q2. Imagine you had data for the entire month on January (encoded as times, e.g 2019-01-01 01:23:45.678). Which of the following intervals make the most sense?**\r\n\r\n- `[start, end]`: .e.g. `[2019-01-01 00:00:00.000, 2019-01-31 23:59:59.999]` **60.9%**\r\n- `[start, end)`: e.g. `[2019-01-01 00:00:00.000, 2019-02-01 00:00:00.000)` **37%**\r\n- `(start, end]`: e.g. `(2018-12-31 23:59:59.999, 2019-01-31 23:59:59.999]` **0%**\r\n- `(start, end)`: e.g. `(2018-12-31 23:59:59.999, 2019-02-01 00:00:00.000)` **2.1%**\r\n\r\n**Q3. Are you aware of any discrepancies with how Superset filters dates or times for SQL databases (Hive, Presto, etc.)?**\r\n\r\n- Yes **21.7%**\r\n- No **78.3%**\r\n\r\n**Q4. Could you please outline which discrepancies you are aware of?**\r\n\r\n- Sometimes when I put my start date in, Superset returns the next date (like it starts with an open interval).\r\n- Sometimes, I set the date range for a chart to be e.g. Jan 1 forward, but the chart ends up not including Jan 1, so I have to change the start date of the chart to dec 31...\r\n- I am generally aware of issues with date filtering and take a trial and error approach until my visualization contains the intended time range.\r\n- Druid and presto do not handle end dates the same way. In some cases the end date is included, but not in others.\r\n- The date filters on Superset are pegged to the end of the day (because timestamps are added in the underlying query) while selecting a date (without timestamps) in Hive or Presto will be inclusive of the full day's activities.\r\n- For relative times (\"Last Quarter\"), the utility in my mind would be looking at (literally) last quarter (Q1), rather than the last ~90 days which is I think what superset does now.\r\n- Granularity period are truncated when selecting exact in ds selector. For instance selecting 2018-01-01 to 2019-01-01 and plotting a line graph per month, would return different result for Jan 2019 than doing the same graph with period 2018-01-01 to 2019-02-01.\r\n- End date not always included in the interval selected.\r\n\r\n**Q5. Are you aware of any discrepancies with how Superset filters dates or times for Druid datasources?**\r\n\r\n- Yes **10.9%**\r\n- No **89.1%**\r\n\r\n**Q6. Could you please outline which discrepancies you are aware of?**\r\n\r\n- The default time filters are not super intuitive.\r\n- There is a difference in using \"Last Saturday\" as an end date criteria. When you run a normal query, the end date is inclusive (it will include last Saturday). with druid, the end date is a \"less than\" so you actually have to set your date to \"Last Sunday\".\r\n- Different handling on date/timeseries range between charts.\r\n\r\n**Q7. Currently Superset handles all temporal data as time. Should Superset support both date and time types?**\r\n\r\n- Yes **58.7%**\r\n- No **0%**\r\n- Unsure **41.3%**\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/494474516/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/494476359","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/7389#issuecomment-494476359","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/7389","id":494476359,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NDQ3NjM1OQ==","user":{"login":"rjurney","id":42149,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42149?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjurney","html_url":"https://github.com/rjurney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjurney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjurney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjurney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjurney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjurney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjurney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjurney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjurney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjurney/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-21T17:05:52Z","updated_at":"2019-05-21T17:05:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yup","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/494476359/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/494500546","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/7568#issuecomment-494500546","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/7568","id":494500546,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NDUwMDU0Ng==","user":{"login":"issue-label-bot[bot]","id":48611044,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDg2MTEwNDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/27079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/issue-label-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-21T18:14:58Z","updated_at":"2019-05-21T18:14:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Issue-Label Bot is automatically applying the label `#question` to this issue, with a confidence of 0.83.

To the best of my knowledge it seems that Looker uses `[start, end)` (see the [`{time} to {time}`](https://docs.looker.com/reference/filter-expressions) item) whereas Tableau uses `[start, end]`. The SQL [`BETWEEN`](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_between.asp) operator also works as `[start, end]`. \r\n\r\nPeople generally think about dates (discrete) as _inclusive_ start/end, i.e., if one were to read a sign \"Sale ends Saturday\" one would expect that the sale would be through close of business on Saturday as opposed to Friday. Times (continuous) however are different and are often thought as having an _exclusive_ end, i.e., a meeting scheduled from 9 - 10 am really is `[9:00, 10:00)`.\r\n\r\nGiven that we foresee time becoming more prevalent I believe it would be a mistake to make date intervals `[start, end]` and time intervals `[start, end)` as this would be quite confusing to the user and thus standardizing on one format is vital. I believe that `[start, end)` is the _best_ format because: \r\n\r\n- It contains no gaps, i..e, the upper bound of preceding interval is the lower bound of the next.\r\n- One does not need to know about the precision of the device, i.e., whether the clock has second, millisecond, or microsecond accuracy.\r\n\r\nFor more detail see [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/9810359) post. Returning to the inclusive dates this can actually be problematic for leap years, i.e., `[02-01, 02-28]` may not capture the entire month of February, i.e., there is a gap whereas `[02-01, 03-01)` is guaranteed to fully encapsulate the month. \r\n\r\nNote this decision is not in agreement with the majority of the survey respondents, however it is worth noting that there was support for the `[start, end)` intervals when considering both dates and timestamps.\r\n\r\nWe suggest the following changes:\r\n\r\n- Explicit call out in the UI how the temporal intervals work, i.e., _inclusive_ of the start, and _exclusive_ of the end. This would require some UI design work to make the time range very explicit.\r\n\r\n### Implementation \r\n\r\nChanging the SQL connector from `[start, end]` (which again often behaves like `(start, end]`) to `[start, end)` is non-trivial, i.e., a simply migration is not feasible given it's impossible to determine whether the producer knew about the discrepancies (and adjusted their time boundaries accordingly). Also we don't want to explicitly modify the chart parameters based on what we perceive may be correct. Per the survey results only 21.7% of respondents were aware of the issue. Rather than performing a migration to address the issue we propose the following (which aims to minimize impact by providing a rollout period): \r\n\r\n- Apply the changes proposed above which are behind a feature flag (disabled by default).†\r\n- New charts will be created with the feature enabled.\r\n- If a non-owner views an old chart the result will remain unchanged. \r\n- If an owner views an old chart, enable the feature and provide a toast/banner in the UI which informs the user that temporal interval has changed. The  toast/banner be dismissed once they have either i) confirmed that the chart is correct, or ii) modified the interval accordingly and saved the chart. \r\n- Provide a toast/banner indicating the potential risk of the change, i.e., a non-timeseries chart and/or one using a non-daily time grain could be deemed problematic/risky.\r\n- Provide a link which will render the chart in its prior state providing producers will a visual diff (which will be controlled via a URL parameter). \r\n- Provide a mechanism for disabling the toast/banner and visual diff after a specific date.\r\n\r\n† This results in additional code logic but it seems like the complexity is worthwhile given the impact of the change and the benefit in being able to see a visual diff of the change.
