present, there are problems in the project that the license header is not uniform and missing. Need a way to help developers automatically add and format license header.\r\nThere are two major options to automatically add license headers to source files:\r\n* Mojo License Maven plugin from codehaus\r\n* Mycila Maven License plugin from mycila\r\n\r\n1.  codehaus used in our projects is mainly used to check third-party dependencies license and defined in licenseCheck profile（not default build plugin）.It can be reused and updated license header，ref to [update-file-header](https://www.mojohaus.org/license-maven-plugin/update-file-header-mojo.html#projectName). It automatically supports [cddl_v1, gpl_v3, mit, gpl_v2, gpl_v1, fdl_v1_3, epl_v2, epl_v1, epl_only_v2, epl_only_v1, agpl_v3, lgpl_v3, lgpl_v2_1, apache_v2, eupl_v1_1, bsd_3, bsd_2] license.Here our apache_v2 header is different from our ASF header, so we can't use the existing one directly. We need to define our header using licenseResolver, but here we need to define each module and fixed file name, ref to [example-add-license](https://www.mojohaus.org/license-maven-plugin/examples/example-add-license.html). so I think that the codehaus plugin is difficult to use as an update license header.\r\n\r\n2. Mycila is indeed almost three years away from the last update, but its corresponding [github](https://github.com/mycila/license-maven-plugin) was updated 4 months ago. The current version of mycila is 3.0. I think its function is clear for a plugin. At present, the function of updating license header is undoubtedly satisfied.\r\n\r\n3.  [rat plugin](https://creadur.apache.org/rat/apache-rat-plugin/index.html) just check license header but not update and format license header.I hope there is a plugin that automatically helps developers format their license header.\r\n\r\nI think it can be divided into two steps for the existing problems.\r\n- Firstly, add or format the license header for the existing source file, but not include the plugin itself.\r\n- Secondly, discuss how to use the plugin to help us automatically add and format the license header in the project.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/498009425/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/498009731","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/pull/4229#issuecomment-498009731","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4229","id":498009731,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5ODAwOTczMQ==","user":{"login":"slievrly","id":8758457,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NTg0NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8758457?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slievrly","html_url":"https://github.com/slievrly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slievrly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slievrly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slievrly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slievrly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slievrly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slievrly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slievrly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slievrly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slievrly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-02T08:15:57Z","updated_at":"2019-06-02T08:15:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@htynkn

The removed line is a blank line between the license header and the package. We need to specify whether we need to keep a blank line between the license header and the package. If you want to keep it, you need to define it in the template file, and it will also increase the blank line of many files. In short, we need to specify this format, all files will be strictly matched.\r\n\r\n2. The mycila license plugin in this pr is used as the default bulid plugin, bound to the generate-sources phase of maven. So when we finish writing the code locally and do the maven compile check, it can automatically check the headers of all source files, add the headers that don't exist, and update the headers with incorrect formats.\r\n\r\n3. For auto add and format licence headers, mojo is harder to use than mycila, and it needs to be defined separately for each module. Mojo is suitable for checking the licenses of third-party dependencies. mycila does not have this feature.\r\n\r\nI will start a discussion with the community via mail group later.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/498186297/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/498208588","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/889#issuecomment-498208588","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/889","id":498208588,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5ODIwODU4OA==","user":{"login":"qixiaobo","id":2881751,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4ODE3NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2881751?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qixiaobo","html_url":"https://github.com/qixiaobo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qixiaobo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qixiaobo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qixiaobo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qixiaobo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qixiaobo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qixiaobo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qixiaobo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qixiaobo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qixiaobo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-03T10:50:21Z","updated_at":"2019-06-03T10:50:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":">
