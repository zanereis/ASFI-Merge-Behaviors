It has been a while since I wrote this stuff. I've poked around a bit to refresh my memory of what we were trying to do.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to have a config system that draws from both the HDFS config and from the DoY config files. When this was written, Drill did not use the HDFS config files; the config info was stored by Drill in ZK. Also, during testing, we might target any number of HDFS systems, so we had to support more than just the local HDFS config file.\r\n\r\nThose considerations led us to use a combination of the Drill-style config file and the HDFS config. Note that the DoY config is *not* the same as the Drill config (though both use the same HOCON library.) There is a chicken-and-egg problem: for the DoY client, Drill is a zip file; there is no actual Drill installed on the machine acting as the DoY client. Also, a single DoY client can run any number of Drill instances. Hence, DoY does not read a Drill config file; the DoY config is a separate entity.\r\n\r\nWith that background, let's look at the [config file](https://github.com/apache/drill/blob/master/drill-yarn/src/main/resources/org/apache/drill/yarn/core/drill-on-yarn-defaults.conf):\r\n\r\n```\r\ndrill.yarn: {\r\n  app-name: \"Drill-on-YARN\"\r\n\r\n  # Settings here support a default single-node cluster on the local host,\r\n  # using the default HDFS connection obtained from the Hadoop config files.\r\n\r\n  dfs: {\r\n    connection: \"\"\r\n    app-dir: \"/user/drill\"\r\n  }\r\n  ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that `drill.yarn.dfs.connection` is supposed to the the target DFS connection. So, if you set that to `hdfs://localhost:9000`, things should work.\r\n\r\nYou noted that we obtain the information twice. The code in [DfsFacade.connect()](https://github.com/apache/drill/blob/master/drill-yarn/src/main/java/org/apache/drill/yarn/core/DfsFacade.java) appears correct:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  public void connect() throws DfsFacadeException {\r\n    loadYarnConfig();\r\n    String dfsConnection = config.getString(DrillOnYarnConfig.DFS_CONNECTION);\r\n    try {\r\n      if (DoYUtil.isBlank(dfsConnection)) {\r\n        fs = FileSystem.get(yarnConf);\r\n      } else {\r\n        URI uri;\r\n        try {\r\n          uri = new URI(dfsConnection);\r\n        } catch (URISyntaxException e) {\r\n          throw new DfsFacadeException(\r\n              \"Illformed DFS connection: \" + dfsConnection, e);\r\n        }\r\n        fs = FileSystem.get(uri, yarnConf);\r\n      }\r\n    } catch (IOException e) {\r\n      throw new DfsFacadeException(\"Failed to create the DFS\", e);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe first use the value from the DoY config. If not set, we fall back to the Hadoop config. This behavior gives us what we want: DoY config first, else fall back to the Hadoop config.\r\n\r\nThe initial note also mentions `loadYarnConfig()`. This method loads, well, the YARN config. The original thought, IIRC, is that the YARN config points to the YARN services; not the HDFS services. Also, the idea was that DoY works with a single YARN instance, identified by its YARN config. (Now, in reality, I suppose that there must be only one HDFS per YARN.) So, it should not be the case that the YARN config breaks HDFS.\r\n\r\nIs it the case, in this instance, that the HDFS server is configured in YARN, but not in the HDFS config files?\r\n\r\nAt this point, I suspect I've exhausted my YARN knowledge. I can, however, offer a suggestion.\r\n\r\nIf the YARN config holds (or reads) the HDFS config more accurately than the default HDFS config, then change the `connect()` method above to use the (cached) YARN config.\r\n\r\nBefore doing this, I'd recommend researching these issues a bit more in the YARN and HDFS configs. Maybe that fs URI check in `loadYarnConfig()` is wrong.\r\n\r\nIt may also be that, to use YARN, you must have a valid YARN config and a valid HDFS config to go with it, so we might not need the DoY connect config. (I suspect this config was added, in part, because MapRFS didn't use the HDFS configs, but I could be wrong.)\r\n\r\nSo, perhaps do a bit more homework, then we can refine the fix.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/759855911/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/760285205","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2141#issuecomment-760285205","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2141","id":760285205,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2MDI4NTIwNQ==","user":{"login":"luocooong","id":50079619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMDc5NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50079619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luocooong","html_url":"https://github.com/luocooong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luocooong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luocooong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luocooong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luocooong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luocooong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luocooong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luocooong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luocooong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luocooong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-14T15:53:00Z","updated_at":"2021-01-14T15:53:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@cgivre Thank you for review the PR.

There are three advantages of using the Java rather than Joda time.\r\n\r\nFirst, Joda was originally written to extend the limited Java date/time classes. Most of the Joda functionality, however, was added to Java 8 and so Joda has been obsolete since Java 8. Drill no longer builds on Java 7, so the need for Joda no longer exists. (Except for the Joda `Period` class, which does not exist in Java for some reason.)\r\n\r\nThe second reason had to due with the JSON writer used for streaming. I can't recall the details (this code was written 6+ months ago), but I think the underlying JSON classes used Java time, so I would either have to convert from Joda to Java on each value; or convert the column accessors to use Java. I chose the latter for the reasons above.\r\n\r\nThe third reason is that the accessor (and other EVF classes) are visible to plugins. By using Joda, we force plugin developers to use obsolete libraries and to remember the differences between Joda and Java time classes, which is a nuisance. By using Java time, we reduce the burden on plugin developers somewhat.\r\n\r\nAs noted in the comment at the top, this change will affect anyone who used the provided schema feature and provided a custom date/time format. I'm guessing that no one has actually used that feature given that we never saw any questions about it. Moving forward, it is better, if anyone does use the custom date/time format, that they do so with Java's format rather than the obsolete Joda

This is handy.\n   - One challenge in drill may be that the user accessing the cluster may\n   have very little control over many of the ways the credentials are\n   provided. For example:\n      - HadoopCredentialsProvider: How are credentials provided by a \"user\"\n      here. Not the \"admin\" who started the cluster (the core-site.xml\nwould need\n      to be edited by the user. How do we handle different users connecting?\n      - EnvCredentialsProvider: How does a user provide environmental\n      variables if they are connecting via ODBC, JDBC, Rest API?  Even SQLLine\n      running remotely may not work here, correct?\n      - VaultCredentialProvider: I like this, however, as above, how does a\n      USER provider a vault location and token? If it's in the\n      drill-override.conf, how will a user specify this information\nseparate from\n      a different user?  Is there a way for Drill to provide an interface to\n      store vault tokens that can be unlocked via user\nauthentication?.   I know\n      this is messy, but essentially you have to have the User Tell Drill I am\n      who I say I am, and then you need Drill, once it verifies this,\nto be able\n      to access the vault on behalf of the authenticated user in order to get\n      passwords for various data stores.  This all must be done security, and\n      ideally in a way that is simple for the user.\n\nThat's my first thought as of now, let me know if my rambling doesn't make\nas much sense typed out as it does in my head.\n\nJohn\n\n\n\nOn Sat, Feb 6, 2021 at 5:56 PM Charles S.

Users can only specify how to access credentials, but it doesn't mean that the user knows actual values stored there, and he shouldn't. Actual credentials may change, but references may leave the same without affecting target users. \r\nProviding some functionality for storing credentials automatically means providing functionality for displaying their values, but as mentioned above, I don't think we want to do that.\r\n\r\nHaving `HadoopCredentialsProvider` is consistent with the Hadoop way of providing configuration, but not more. It may be useful for the case when we have some pre-defined credentials that may be used in storage plugins, but it is not aimed for the case of frequently added/updated credentials.\r\n\r\n`EnvCredentialsProvider` has a similar use case, but for the k8s world. Some pre-defined credentials may be exposed into the container as env variables, so Drill can use them, it may also be useful, but for limited cases as the earlier one.\r\n\r\nI would expect `VaultCredentialProvider` to be used more compared to the two previous ones. I assumed the flow would be the following: administrator configures Drill with specified vault address and token. After that, users either ask the admin or use some tool for adding/viewing/updating credentials.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Drill differentiates only two user kinds: admins and regular users. Admins can create storage plugins, and all plugins created by one admin are visible to all other admins. This PR doesn't aim to improve Drill user management, it just provides minimal functionality for storage plugins credentials, so currently we use the same Vault token for all users. \r\n\r\nThere is also a discussion for improving Drill roles and permissions: https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rbb4a83a67ee92b081d0ce3a17533dce5bfaf31b4dcc10ee9fd3cff33%40%3Cdev.drill.apache.org%3E. One of the ideas @vdiravka proposed is integrating with Vault. So in this case, the user will already be associated with some Vault token and this value may be used instead of providing the token in configs, hope we will follow that way.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/775383960/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/776956339","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2156#issuecomment-776956339","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2156","id":776956339,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3Njk1NjMzOQ==","user":{"login":"eevanwong","id":71536798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNTM2Nzk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71536798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eevanwong","html_url":"https://github.com/eevanwong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eevanwong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eevanwong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eevanwong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eevanwong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eevanwong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eevanwong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eevanwong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eevanwong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eevanwong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-10T19:23:50Z","updated_at":"2021-02-10T19:23:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hey!

This is Drill: nothing is simple, things build on hacks which build on undocumented complexities. I suspect that is the issue here.\r\n\r\nIn particular, we need to know the rules for buffer ownership in UDFs which is, of course, not documented. The only reasonable way to learn this is to run a query, save the generated Java code and inspect the calls. Warning: the generated code is a huge mess.\r\n\r\nThe key question is this: when you declare an `@Inject` variable (`buffer` in your case), does the runtime provide an initial buffer? My guess is that it does in the form of a \"managed\" buffer. (This just means that there is some auto-free mechanism.) I believe that the buffer is allocated on each call, but the generated code will say for sure. (The UDF code is copied into the generated code.)\r\n\r\nThe function declares an `@Output`, in this case `out`. If this variable provides a buffer, it would seem that ownership has to pass to the caller, since the caller will copy that buffer into a value vector. My guess is that if the buffer is \"managed\", it will be freed automatically at some point.\r\n\r\n(Note that managed buffers can cause an OOM because of when they are freed: I think it is during fragment shutdown, IIRC. I had to fix a reader bug related to this issue.)\r\n\r\nTo summarize, it appears that the proper pattern in UDFs is:\r\n\r\n* Declare an `@Inject` buffer which the runtime will provide.\r\n* Resize the buffer if needed, using the return value from `reallocIfNeeded`.\r\n* Use that buffer as the output buffer by setting it to `out.buffer` where needed.\r\n* Managed buffers are freed automatically, at some unknown point.\r\n\r\nIf this is true, there is no reason to update `buffer`, the proper pattern is shown in [DecimalAggrTypeFunctions1](https://github.com/apache/drill/blob/2eb6979206ad1b6f830a070dffa822edbfac6189/exec/java-exec/src/main/codegen/templates/Decimal/DecimalAggrTypeFunctions1.java#L113) (with my own comments):\r\n\r\n``` java\r\n    // Inject means that the runtime will provide a default-size buffer on each call\r\n    @Inject DrillBuf buffer;\r\n    // Holder for output. NOT initialized b the runtime.\r\n    @Output ${type.outputType}Holder out;\r\n    ...\r\n        // Resize the provided buffer, replacing if necessary, and assigning that\r\n        // to the output variable.\r\n        out.buffer = buffer.reallocIfNeeded(len);\r\n        // Using the now-valid output buffer, copy in any needed data.\r\n        out.buffer.setBytes(0, bytes);\r\n        // Upon exit, is the output buffer is now owned by caller? Must be, or the output\r\n        // data would be immediately freed if the caller were to release the injected\r\n        // buffer, and all hell would break loose.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs usual, there is no documentation of this, you just gotta know (or figure it out every time.)\r\n\r\nThe buffer management happens in `BufferManagerImpl`, as shown in the JIRA stack trace, which is called by `reallocIfNeeded`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  public DrillBuf replace(DrillBuf old, int newSize) {\r\n    if (managedBuffers.remove(old.memoryAddress()) == null) {\r\n      throw new IllegalStateException(\"Tried to remove unmanaged buffer.\");\r\n    }\r\n    old.release(1);\r\n    return getManagedBuffer(newSize);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is saying, \"Hey, that buffer you gave me? It ain't one of mine.\" The question is why. The theory in this bug is that we forgot to replace our working buffer. Let's check that by doing a [search for `reallocIfNeeded`](https://github.com/apache/drill/search?p=2&q=reallocIfNeeded). We find many cases where we don't save the reallocated buffer back into the `@Inject` variable. For [example](https://github.com/apache/drill/blob/2eb6979206ad1b6f830a070dffa822edbfac6189/exec/java-exec/src/main/codegen/templates/Decimal/DecimalAggrTypeFunctions1.java#L113):\r\n\r\n``` java\r\n        out.buffer = buffer.reallocIfNeeded(len);\r\n        out.buffer.setBytes(0, bytes);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI *suspect*, but am not sure without running the code, that every call to the UDF is issued a new managed `buffer`. So, I suspect that the problem will only occur if, within a single function call, we:\r\n\r\n* Call `reallocIfNeeded` and get a new buffer.\r\n* Call `reallocIfNeeded` on the original (now unregistered) buffer, but only if the previous call actually resized the buffer.\r\n\r\nLooking at the code in this function, there are no loops, so there is no ability to make the above mistake. Yet, many other functions in the file changed here have the exact same code pattern introduced in this fix. Why does the code work so often if many other functions *do not* follow the pattern adopted here?\r\n\r\nThere are two possibilities:\r\n\r\n* The generated code has a bug: it is not providing a new buffer on each function invocation.\r\n* The problem is not where we think it is: it is elsewhere. (The stack trace in the JIRA ticket shows generated code, so we can't be sure which bit of code is actually making the call.)\r\n\r\nIn particular, I'm not convinced that the unit test reproduces the error. The unit test is different from the query in the JIRA ticket. A good practice is to run the proposed test *before* any fix to make sure we can reproduce the issue.\r\n\r\nThe proposed test (simplified):\r\n\r\n``` sql\r\nselect concat(cast(null as varchar), EXPR$0) as c1\r\n            \"from (values('foo'), ('bar'))\r\n```\r\n\r\nUser's query (also simplified):\r\n\r\n``` sql\r\nselect concat(BinaryValue, 'aaa') NewVarcharValue from ...;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat is different? It may not be obvious, but in the first query, we have a `NULL` const and a column (value vector, which happens to be defined by a `VALUES` clause with a constant). In the second, we have a column value and a string constant. That string constant is not stored in a value vector, it is in a temporary buffer (IIRC).\r\n\r\nMy hunch is that the problem is with the constant: it is causing something to break. This is why so many of the functions in `StringFunctions.java` have code like the proposed fix: they are also likely tested with constants. If the problem is with constants, then it means that all other UDFs that work with strings, but don't have the proposed fix, will fail when used with constants.\r\n\r\nThat is, sounds like we got us a bit of a problem; this fix is just the tip of the iceberg.\r\n\r\nHow should we proceed? We can do just this fix, and fix other issues as people encounter and report them. Or, we can figure out what is *really* going on by looking at the generated code. To do that, modify the [Project operator](https://github.com/apache/drill/blob/master/exec/java-exec/src/main/java/org/apache/drill/exec/physical/impl/project/ProjectRecordBatch.java#L279):\r\n\r\n``` java\r\n    boolean saveCode = true; \\\\ change from false in the master branch\r\n```\r\n\r\nSet the variable to `true` as shown above (it will be `false` by default.) Run a query like the user's. Code will be generated. By default I think it is in `/tmp/drill/codegen/...`. Analyze what's going on with the `@Inject` buffer.\r\n\r\nPay particular attention to how constants are handled. What is causing us to try to reallocate a non-managed buffer in this case?\r\n\r\nAs it turns out, with this trick, you can actually *debug* the generated code. A bit after the above line is one that generates the file. Set a breakpoint after that line. Then, go hunt down the generated file. Set a breakpoint somewhere. Let the code run. It will stop at your breakpoint in the generated code. This is easy in Eclipse. IIRC, IntelliJ users have to do some trick to put the code in a path that IntelliJ likes. Jinfeng may have left a note somewhere from how he made it work many years ago.\r\n\r\nThen, we can decide how to proceed:\r\n\r\n* If the fix here is the correct one, make it in all UDFs that have the wrong pattern. (See the search above, there are **many** such occurrences.) Add a comment to the `reallocIfNeeded` method to explain the proper usage. Provide a code snippet to show what should be done.\r\n* If the problem is with constant handling, work out what should be done. Fix it. Revert the `out.buffer = buffer = buffer.ralloc...` bits of code in `StringFunctions.java` and retest to ensure constants work correctly.\r\n\r\nBTW, in researching these issues, I found a number of other problems.\r\n\r\nIf the proposed fix is correct, then a particularly nasty buf is [here](https://github.com/apache/drill/blob/2eb6979206ad1b6f830a070dffa822edbfac6189/exec/vector/src/main/java/org/apache/drill/exec/vector/ValueHolderHelper.java#L121) where the new buffer is created internally and never returned.\r\n\r\nThe function we're trying to fix, `ConcatLeftNullInput`, has a bug:\r\n\r\n``` java\r\npublic static class ConcatLeftNullInput implements DrillSimpleFunc {\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void eval() {\r\n      out.buffer = buffer.reallocIfNeeded( (left.end - left.start) + (right.end - right.start));\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe function is `...LeftNullInput` and, yet, we are asking for the `left.end` and `left.start`. By definition these are zero. Why? Because the left is `NULL`. In fact, if the left value is `NULL`, I'm not sure the `start` and `end` values are even defined to be any particular value. (Amazing this stuff works as well as it does.)\r\n\r\nIn the same file, this code is *just plain wrong*:\r\n\r\n``` java\r\npublic static class Replace implements DrillSimpleFunc {\r\n    ...\r\n    @Inject DrillBuf buffer;\r\n    @Output VarCharHolder out;\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void setup() {\r\n      buffer = buffer.reallocIfNeeded(8000);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee the bug? What if the new string is larger than 8K? Kaboom. What if the string is 10 characters? Huge waste of memory. The above is what we call \"crude and not quite effective\", it works most of the time, except when it doesn't.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/791072405/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/791555660","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2168#issuecomment-791555660","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2168","id":791555660,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5MTU1NTY2MA==","user":{"login":"eevanwong","id":71536798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNTM2Nzk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71536798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eevanwong","html_url":"https://github.com/eevanwong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eevanwong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eevanwong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eevanwong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eevanwong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eevanwong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eevanwong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eevanwong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eevanwong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eevanwong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-05T17:09:22Z","updated_at":"2021-03-05T17:09:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vvysotskyi  I've encountered a few issues with the testing.

This happens once for each new schema in **ProjectRecordBatch#setupNewSchemaFromInput**\r\n\r\nWhen calculating the function body, the following buffer usage pattern is used:\r\n- Extract the current buffer from the class field to a local variable (**DrillBuf buffer = work0;**)\r\n- Execute the function body\r\n- Save the value of the local buffer variable in the class field (**work0 = buffer;**)\r\n\r\nIn the current implementation, managed buffer is \"reused\" for each subsequent row. Therefore, the result of reallocIfNeeded must be stored in the buffer field declared within the function.\r\n\r\n2. You are not quite right when you say that the result of left. end - left. start will always be 0. For example, the same implementation of the function will be used in the case when the first argument is the nullable field of the parquet file, in which not all values will be null.\r\nP.S. Perhaps I did not understand you correctly\r\n\r\n3. Unfortunately, I can't use the sample query given in the bug, as it uses a file that is missing in the Drill project. In addition, this file is uploaded to MapR jira, where I do not have access. If you can attach a file to the specified Drill bug, I will happily replace my query with the query given in the bug.\r\n\r\nP.S.
