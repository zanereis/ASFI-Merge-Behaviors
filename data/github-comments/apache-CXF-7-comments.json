building the endpoint URL.\r\n\r\nSorry, but unfortunately, I don't know if I'll be able to quickly create a specific test for this scenario (due to professional and familiar reasons - same reason for my delay in answering).\r\n\r\n- [x] Would anyone be interested in creating tests for this feature?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/403107325/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/403226242","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cxf/pull/429#issuecomment-403226242","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/429","id":403226242,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMzIyNjI0Mg==","user":{"login":"reta","id":509855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTg1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/509855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta","html_url":"https://github.com/reta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-07T16:15:50Z","updated_at":"2018-07-07T16:15:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks @mo7ty , will do that as part of Swagger tests suite","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/403226242/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/403638545","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cxf/pull/396#issuecomment-403638545","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/396","id":403638545,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMzYzODU0NQ==","user":{"login":"andymc12","id":21365299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzY1Mjk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21365299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymc12","html_url":"https://github.com/andymc12","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymc12/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymc12/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymc12/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymc12/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymc12/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymc12/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymc12/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymc12/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymc12/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-09T22:19:53Z","updated_at":"2018-07-09T22:19:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@johnament -

Thanks a lot for addressing this very edgy case. I was looking how the current implementation works and basically I was trying to understand if we could defer the evaluation of the HTTP parameters (like `@FormParam`) to a later phase. In general, I think it would be feasible but would significantly impact the existing design.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think I found a simple trick to make it work: reordering parameters initialization. Here is an interesting exercise:\r\n\r\n- `Response processForm(@FormParam(\"value\") String value, Form form)` -> does not work\r\n- `Response processForm(Form form, @FormParam(\"value\") String value)` -> works just fine\r\n\r\nSo the idea in the nutshell is to a modify `JAXRSUtils::processParameters` to initialize parameters in a different order. In this case, the `Form` should be initialized before any `@FormParam`, it triggers the reader interceptors and the right values are propagated in `Form` and `@FromParam` arguments. It should also work in case of constructors or class members.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? \r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/427585364/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/427958475","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cxf/pull/453#issuecomment-427958475","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/453","id":427958475,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNzk1ODQ3NQ==","user":{"login":"andymc12","id":21365299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzY1Mjk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21365299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymc12","html_url":"https://github.com/andymc12","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymc12/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymc12/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymc12/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymc12/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymc12/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymc12/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymc12/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymc12/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymc12/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-08T19:51:45Z","updated_at":"2018-10-08T19:51:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@reta Thanks so much!  That is a much better solution that what I had originally proposed.  I had also considered that the \"right approach\" would be to refactor the phase when parameters were processed, but I think this solution is cleaner - and should not disrupt normal cases.\r\n\r\nI've left the test cases unaltered, but I removed my changes from `JAXRSInvoker` and instead changed `JAXRSUtils` as you suggested.  This passes all of the unit tests and the systests (including my new one).  Can you take a look at the latest changes?\r\n\r\nThanks again!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/427958475/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/427987700","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cxf/pull/453#issuecomment-427987700","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/453","id":427987700,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNzk4NzcwMA==","user":{"login":"reta","id":509855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTg1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/509855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta","html_url":"https://github.com/reta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-08T21:38:42Z","updated_at":"2018-10-08T21:38:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Looks good, thanks @andymc12 !
