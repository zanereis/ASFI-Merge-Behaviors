While a multi select allows for single select, depending on the user base, we sometimes do need to prevent a multi select.  Is FilterBox enhancements actively in the works by any chance on any PR?

Looks like control name mismatch between the example and the actual new controls. After finding the `tasks` table and picking the right fields and colors it started looking good.\r\n\r\nI also like the new `StyleMappingControl`, I can see reusing this in other places. \r\n\r\nFew usability recommendations before I get into the code:\r\n* we should use a palette and attribute colors to statuses for the ones that user have not provided a color mapping yet (checkout function `getColorFromScheme`)\r\n* the status should be in the tooltip\r\n* there's an epoch-looking number in the tooltip, let's remove it or use something more human readable\r\n* hovering the boxes drop the border\r\n* visually things look different than the nvd3, anything that would make it look more align would be best, maybe reusing some of the nvd3 css classes in the axis
