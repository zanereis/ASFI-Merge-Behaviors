And I realized that setting your logger to INFO level is a proper way not just a workaround, because you need to first let the logging.logger.handler receive the logRecord before it can be intercepted (this is how logging library is written). \r\n\r\nThe reason why it is acting differently inside uwsgi is that the particular logger in Django core code is disabled for some reason (performance I suppose), then nothing at the INFO level shows up anymore. In bare django settings, it will output much more INFO level logs (server logs) like here. So if you need these INFO level logs collected, you need to find a way to reenable the Django loggers, but this is not related to SkyWalking anymore.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26076517/162923317-34b0525b-d89e-4c99-ac98-b06f02855fa5.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nTLDR, the proper way to deal with this is to make your logger level at least the same as the level you set in agent so that it can be intercepted.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/1096408581/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/1096418760","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/8854#issuecomment-1096418760","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/8854","id":1096418760,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArmls85BWgXI","user":{"login":"Superskyyy","id":26076517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDc2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26076517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Superskyyy","html_url":"https://github.com/Superskyyy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Superskyyy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Superskyyy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Superskyyy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Superskyyy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Superskyyy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Superskyyy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Superskyyy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Superskyyy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Superskyyy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-12T09:12:44Z","updated_at":"2022-04-12T09:12:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Todo for me: enhance document on the reporter level config.
