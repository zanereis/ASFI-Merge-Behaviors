comm_buf is unordered_map, before accessing the ndarray, accessing unordered_map (potentially adding a key) without synchronization is a race. The engine only kicks in after the comm_buf_ is accessed.\r\n\r\nThis is only safe is the pull() and push() methods themselves are called serially. Is that true?\r\n\r\n\r\ncomm_buf_ = {}\r\nT1:              |              T2:\r\npush(0)       |           push(1)\r\n//race\r\n\r\ncomm_buf_ = {0:ndarray1,1:ndarray2}\r\nT1:              |              T2:\r\npush(0)       |           push(1)\r\n//standard says race, but most likely safe\r\n\r\ncomm_buf_ = {0:ndarray1,1, 1:ndarray2}\r\nT1:              |              T2:\r\npush(0)       |           push(0)\r\n//standard says race, but most likely safe\r\n\r\nSo unless MXNET guarantees push and pull themselves are serialized, it seems to me it's unsafe.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/304404831/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/304405769","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/6464#issuecomment-304405769","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/6464","id":304405769,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNDQwNTc2OQ==","user":{"login":"jae0choi","id":6279831,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNzk4MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6279831?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jae0choi","html_url":"https://github.com/jae0choi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jae0choi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jae0choi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jae0choi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jae0choi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jae0choi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jae0choi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jae0choi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jae0choi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jae0choi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-26T23:07:19Z","updated_at":"2017-05-26T23:07:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@patricianing By 'synsets', do you mean the mapping from geo-coordinate (latitude, longitude) to geographical cell?  \r\nFor instance, the mapping such as (lat:37.12, lon:122.23) --> (cell#12)?
