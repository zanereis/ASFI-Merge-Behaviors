for @tqchen 's suggestion. I looked into tvm.build. I think there are probably two ways to generate just one module.\r\n\r\n- Modify `tvm.build` somehow so that we only need to call it once with all lowered functions. I think the most important thing in this solution is to know which target a `func` (https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/master/python/tvm/build_module.py#L456) belongs to. It means we probably need have a `target` attribute in loweredfunc, and this attribute could be set when we call `MakeAPI`. It also means we probably want to pass `target` to `tvm.lower` when a lowered function is generated. \r\n\r\n- Call `tvm.build` multiple times, each time a different target is passed into this function. There would be multiple binaries depending on the number of devices as what we are currently doing. In the end, we can probably implement a `combine_modules(device_modules, host_module)` method which combines all the devices modules to the host_module using `import_module`. This way, we don't need any change to the current `tvm.build`, `tvm.lower`, and tvm c++ pass APIs, except having a simple combining function. But we need to change `grpah_compile.cc` slightly to pass individual targets to `tvm.build` multiple times in the future when we work on the compiler PR. \r\n**Update:** This solution does have another problem because the current TVM doesn't support exporting hierarchical  modules to binary files (https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/master/src/codegen/codegen.cc#L40).\r\n\r\nI quickly tested both methods locally and it seemed that both worked. I think both solutions are simple, but the second one needs fewer changes to the current code base.

This is a kind of hack, but it worked for me.\r\n\r\nIn your case, you can overwrite all NHWC layout attributes, run NCHW network as usual, and then convert the output to NHWC if necessary.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/421242841/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/421243794","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/1718#issuecomment-421243794","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1718","id":421243794,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMTI0Mzc5NA==","user":{"login":"srkreddy1238","id":14215163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjE1MTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14215163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238","html_url":"https://github.com/srkreddy1238","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-14T06:21:54Z","updated_at":"2018-09-14T06:21:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@masahi I too attempted entire network operation in NCHW instead of specific operators but we can't generalize it, reason explained [here](https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/run-tutorial-compile-tensorflow-models-on-gpu/538/4)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/421243794/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/421258363","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/1718#issuecomment-421258363","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1718","id":421258363,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMTI1ODM2Mw==","user":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-14T07:32:04Z","updated_at":"2018-09-14T07:32:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"You can also overwrite \"axis\" and \"shape\" attributes.

:\r\nFirst of all, gcc/llvm's schedule does not do any aggressive loop transformation to the program itself. As far as I know, gcc's \"schedule\" is to achieve the highest instruction level parallelism. This transformation, although aggressive, is very fine-grained.\r\n\r\nAlso, I know a successful instance that lowers pragma+c to llvm to its target, which is HLS. It relies on pragmas very much, and the compiler does not do any aggressive transformations to loops either. It just supports some factored unroll (not reordering). Thus, pragma can only achieve a subset of what the scheduler functions can do. It also violates the design philosophy of TVM, because pragma is a part of the program itself, but the purpose of scheduling function is to decouple program and tuning space. \r\n\r\nReturn to this issue: Technically, TVM decouples computing body and the loop levels, but in the hybrid case this separation is no longer that clear. However, we can still leverage some compilation techniques to detect those loop levels which are parallelable and use the corresponding scheduling methods to manipulate the function body.\r\n\r\n@kevinthesun :\r\nThe purpose of hybrid script is to enhance the generality of TVM and I can foresee that in-place implementation will be a very common pattern to support. To utilize the current infrastructures, @tqchen suggested that we can use some kind of \"bind thing\". i.e. those in-place tensor will have different placeholders and be binded to the same storage buffer.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/421529709/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/421532675","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/1384#issuecomment-421532675","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1384","id":421532675,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMTUzMjY3NQ==","user":{"login":"xqdan","id":23742050,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNzQyMDUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23742050?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xqdan","html_url":"https://github.com/xqdan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xqdan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xqdan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xqdan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xqdan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xqdan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xqdan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xqdan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xqdan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xqdan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-15T05:30:39Z","updated_at":"2018-09-15T11:23:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@were if you take a look at the passes of gcc, you will find lots of loop transformations. compute and schedule are also separated in compiler, the only difference here is schedule in tvm is done manually, and compiler can optimize in a automatically way or based on hints/flags from users. also gcc has very aggressive transformation like software pipelining for loops. \r\nhttps://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/229c0ef777161ec5adfb71ef1611af502541ccda/gcc/passes.def\r\n        \r\n```\r\n         NEXT_PASS (pass_tree_loop_init);\r\n\t  NEXT_PASS (pass_tree_unswitch);\r\n\t  NEXT_PASS (pass_scev_cprop);\r\n\t  NEXT_PASS (pass_loop_split);\r\n\t  NEXT_PASS (pass_loop_jam);\r\n\t  /* All unswitching, final value replacement and splitting can expose\r\n\t     empty loops.

Also I don't see any differences between pragma + passes and tvm schedule api for tuning, pragma and passes's flag also can be tuned, lots of research is about how to tune the options of compiler flags for better performance.  \r\n\r\nFor aggressive or not, and automatically or not, if controlled by users(with schedule api/pragmas/flag options), schedule or transformations are not automatic but can be aggressive. if doing by tvm itself, not aggressive but automatic, both can be options for users.\r\n\r\nIMO, the similar story is repeating in another place, you can see operators fusion just looks like inter procedure optimizations(eg inline), and passes in tvm is intra procedure optimizations, for example, double buffer is just a subset of software pipeline, BTW, you can control double buffer in schedule api, but actually it's a real pass.\r\n\r\nFor this issue, we don't need to care about the separation thing for hybrid, that's fine, and I suggest we implement split/reorder/.. in c++ passes, and provide api for users controlling for now, and the next would be we can analyze ir stream in tvm and decide to optimize or not.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/421532675/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/421602035","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/1715#issuecomment-421602035","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1715","id":421602035,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMTYwMjAzNQ==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-15T17:16:28Z","updated_at":"2018-09-15T17:16:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@kazum

I think that postponing codegen should be able to solve the hierarchical module problem. \r\n\r\nI would like to go for the approach of returning (fhost, device_module) because I don't want have loweredfunc as a member of the module class.

On the other hand, returning the (fhost, device_module) tuple also keeps code clean and simple. \r\n\r\nI will update the PR soon to 1) move the definition of `GraphRuntime` back to cc file, 2) document the `device` column in the json file, and 3) clean the other files accordingly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/422166487/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/422218883","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/1572#issuecomment-422218883","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1572","id":422218883,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMjIxODg4Mw==","user":{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-18T01:01:24Z","updated_at":"2018-09-18T01:01:24Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Any update @dayanandasiet ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/422218883/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/422235263","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/1694#issuecomment-422235263","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1694","id":422235263,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMjIzNTI2Mw==","user":{"login":"liangfu","id":857821,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1NzgyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/857821?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu","html_url":"https://github.com/liangfu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-18T02:43:12Z","updated_at":"2018-09-18T02:43:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@tmoreau89 I've successfully performed gemm in simulation lately, and cleaned up unused code.
