I understand `ICHECK` is an assertion. A test could be added to check that the assertion was fired for incorrect datatypes but I don't think that's good practice, since assertions should only exist as a programmer aid. ~~They're also only triggered in a debug build, so the test would fail if this is not the case~~ (I was incorrect about this point). Furthermore, interaction from a user perspective should mean this assertion is never encountered since we only pattern match and offload the operations (and compatible attributes) that are supported by the microNPU. Incompatible operations should never reach this level, and so the assertion shouldn't get triggered unless there is a programmer error.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/948626646/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/948683072","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/9341#issuecomment-948683072","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/9341","id":948683072,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM44i8FA","user":{"login":"jinhongyii","id":44201588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MjAxNTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44201588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii","html_url":"https://github.com/jinhongyii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-21T14:36:54Z","updated_at":"2021-10-21T14:36:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"cc:

For removing FInferCorrectLayout, it looks like most of attrs are set to ElemwiseArbitraryLayout, but some of the QNN ops are set to custom layout methods (QNN concatenate has the method QnnConcatenateLayout). Do you know if that layout method is actually used? \r\n\r\n(cc @AndrewZhaoLuo, you might be interested in this question :) )","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/948834590/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/948859612","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/9313#issuecomment-948859612","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/9313","id":948859612,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM44jnLc","user":{"login":"mbs-octoml","id":87091372,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MDkxMzcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87091372?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml","html_url":"https://github.com/mbs-octoml","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-21T17:44:36Z","updated_at":"2021-10-21T17:44:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Note the CI failure looks to be a flake (TVMCI-8).\r\n\r\n@jroesch @electriclilies for review","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/948859612/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/948904169","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/9343#issuecomment-948904169","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/9343","id":948904169,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM44jyDp","user":{"login":"kparzysz-quic","id":48801706,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4ODAxNzA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48801706?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic","html_url":"https://github.com/kparzysz-quic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-21T18:45:19Z","updated_at":"2021-10-21T18:45:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@csullivan ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/948904169/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/948907875","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/9328#issuecomment-948907875","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/9328","id":948907875,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM44jy9j","user":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-21T18:50:39Z","updated_at":"2021-10-21T18:50:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Yes this is a known new CI issue since this week.
