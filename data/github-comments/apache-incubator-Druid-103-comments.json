Thanks for the feedback, here's my thoughts on the issues:\n- I haven't run the query using having clause before, but looking at the tests, it seems like aggregators with complex intermediate type such as HyperUnique doesn't work with having clause #2507. I can't think of a nice solution to fix this now, so perhaps we can add similar workaround as #2496 if this feature is needed.\n- Maybe I'm not understanding this properly, but is there a use case for this other than ingestion?\n- Did you try with \"context\" : {\"finalize\" : true}  in inner group by query? It should fix the error, check the comments above for explanation. This is not very intuitive, and should probably go into the doc.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/240221156/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/240253168","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/3369#issuecomment-240253168","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3369","id":240253168,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MDI1MzE2OA==","user":{"login":"jon-wei","id":8729063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MjkwNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8729063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei","html_url":"https://github.com/jon-wei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-16T22:00:11Z","updated_at":"2016-08-16T22:00:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":":+1:\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/240253168/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/240270106","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/3370#issuecomment-240270106","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3370","id":240270106,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MDI3MDEwNg==","user":{"login":"jon-wei","id":8729063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MjkwNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8729063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei","html_url":"https://github.com/jon-wei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-16T23:25:46Z","updated_at":"2016-08-16T23:25:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":":+1:\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/240270106/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/240278554","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/3361#issuecomment-240278554","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3361","id":240278554,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MDI3ODU1NA==","user":{"login":"giaosudau","id":539238,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzOTIzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/539238?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/giaosudau","html_url":"https://github.com/giaosudau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giaosudau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giaosudau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giaosudau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giaosudau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giaosudau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giaosudau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giaosudau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giaosudau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giaosudau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-17T00:16:18Z","updated_at":"2016-08-17T00:16:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@fjy sure. done.\n@b-slim Thanks.

For block based compression layout, the total time for reading column is composed of : copy byte buffer block + decompression + read values from byte buffer. \n\n`longs + lz4` takes more time on the decompression part, while `delta + lz4` take more time on the read value part. For readContinuous, the two differences kinda cancel out, making the performance similar. For readSkipping, the read value part is basically gone with so few reads, while the decompression part remains around the same, making `longs + lz4` take much longer.\n\nI did some benchmark using the uncompressed strategy, which goes through the same process as lz4 for copy block + read value, with the only difference being no decompression step. The difference in time between lz4 and uncompressed should be the time for decompression. From the benchmarks below, it seems that readContinuous and readSkipping decompression time matches.\n\nNote delta strategy is renamed to auto since the strategy could use delta, table, or longs depending on data cardinality and maximum offset.\n\n```\nenumerate\nreadContinuous\n auto           lz4  10  29.033 ¬± 1.111  ms/op\n auto  uncompressed  10  28.591 ¬± 0.911  ms/op\nlongs           lz4  10  20.878 ¬± 1.856  ms/op\nlongs  uncompressed  10  17.101 ¬± 0.358  ms/op\nreadSkipping\n auto           lz4  10   1.459 ¬± 0.069  ms/op\n auto  uncompressed  10   0.236 ¬± 0.123  ms/op\nlongs           lz4  10   5.889 ¬± 2.222  ms/op\nlongs  uncompressed  10   3.327 ¬± 1.929  ms/op\n\nzipfLow\nreadContinuous\n auto           lz4  10  35.505 ¬± 0.744  ms/op\n auto  uncompressed  10  31.311 ¬± 1.022  ms/op\nlongs           lz4  10  33.904 ¬± 2.328  ms/op\nlongs  uncompressed  10  17.404 ¬± 0.690  ms/op\nreadSkipping\n auto           lz4  10   4.941 ¬± 0.360  ms/op\n auto  uncompressed  10   0.522 ¬± 0.141  ms/op\nlongs           lz4  10  18.387 ¬± 1.321  ms/op\nlongs  uncompressed  10   3.390 ¬± 2.403  ms/op\n\n\nzipfHigh\nreadContinuous\n auto           lz4  10  26.399 ¬± 1.428  ms/op\n auto  uncompressed  10  23.593 ¬± 0.667  ms/op\nlongs           lz4  10  23.355 ¬± 1.868  ms/op\nlongs  uncompressed  10  17.335 ¬± 0.796  ms/op\nreadSkipping\n auto           lz4  10   2.914 ¬± 0.259  ms/op\n auto  uncompressed  10   0.383 ¬± 0.142  ms/op\nlongs           lz4  10   8.015 ¬± 0.590  ms/op\nlongs  uncompressed  10   3.406 ¬± 2.738  ms/op\n\nsequential\nreadContinuous\n auto           lz4  10  29.491 ¬± 0.951  ms/op\n auto  uncompressed  10  28.636 ¬± 0.351  ms/op\nlongs           lz4  10  54.110 ¬± 0.894  ms/op\nlongs  uncompressed  10  17.035 ¬± 0.249  ms/op\nreadSkipping\n auto           lz4  10   1.335 ¬± 0.735  ms/op\n auto  uncompressed  10   1.079 ¬± 0.282  ms/op\nlongs           lz4  10  39.549 ¬± 0.544  ms/op\nlongs  uncompressed  10   3.472 ¬± 2.714  ms/op\n\nuniform\nreadContinuous\n auto           lz4  10  31.522 ¬± 1.021  ms/op\n auto  uncompressed  10  33.260 ¬± 1.238  ms/op\nlongs           lz4  10  32.292 ¬± 1.532  ms/op\nlongs  uncompressed  10  17.211 ¬± 0.955  ms/op\nreadSkipping\n auto           lz4  10   0.746 ¬± 0.518  ms/op\n auto  uncompressed  10   0.528 ¬± 0.176  ms/op\nlongs           lz4  10  18.018 ¬± 1.105  ms/op\nlongs  uncompressed  10   3.302 ¬± 2.018  ms/op\n```\n\nI'm not sure why lz4 decompression is faster for auto compared to longs even though the compressed size are similar.

I don't really love the idea of maintaining two versions just to support lz4 compression.\n\nMy main consideration in whether to move to 0.10 is how big of a nuisance broker updates would be for users. It can be done as a no-downtime rolling update so it's mainly the inconvenience of it I suppose. Again, it kinda feels like too much to ask for no benefit except for lz4 working (the other compression formats gzip and snappy work fine).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/242537931/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/242623427","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/3397#issuecomment-242623427","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3397","id":242623427,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MjYyMzQyNw==","user":{"login":"fjy","id":428325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODMyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy","html_url":"https://github.com/fjy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-26T03:54:44Z","updated_at":"2016-08-26T03:54:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@navis

Nishant for your suggestion. \nI looked at #2806 and read that people are concerned about the asymptotic complexity of the algorithm proposed there.\nLooking at the metamarkets blog post about the new cost function, I liked how mathematical these guys were about defining the cost function, but I think it might be missing a piece.\n\nIn the context of machine learning, the common paradigm is:\n\noptimization objective = cost function + regularization term\n\nCould it be that the current balancer is missing the regularization term?\nUsually, the cost function complexity grows linearly with the problem size but the regularization term has a constant complexity as it penalizes the parameters used in the cost function and is therefore independent of the number of datapoints a cost function iterates over.\n\nIn the concrete case of the balancer the regularization term could quantify the cost of executing the segment movements to counterbalance the benefit of moving them which is modeled by the cost function.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/242978540/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/242996164","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/3402#issuecomment-242996164","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3402","id":242996164,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0Mjk5NjE2NA==","user":{"login":"fjy","id":428325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODMyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy","html_url":"https://github.com/fjy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-28T20:06:50Z","updated_at":"2016-08-28T20:06:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"üëç
