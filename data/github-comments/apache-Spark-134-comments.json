After my second thought, this suggestion is not good. toString in Java world gives back human readable format.\n\nThe reason why I came up this question is I am writing wrapper of Duration in Python. Since you are familiar with Python, Could I ask some questions?\n\nDo we need dunder str and dunder repr in Duration? If they are needed, what they should give back respectively?\n\n```\nstr(Duration)\n\"10 ms\"\n\nrepr(Duration)\n\"10\"\n```\n\nBTW \ntoFormattedString is not used anywhere. Regarding to toString, I think it is not used anywhere in streaming, though I need more time to look deeply.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/43447806/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/43449385","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/770#issuecomment-43449385","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/770","id":43449385,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNDQ5Mzg1","user":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-18T19:43:12Z","updated_at":"2014-05-18T19:43:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@mateiz That's a good question. I browsed through the Hadoop 2.4.0 binary distribution, and it looks like none of the `hadoop-*` JAR files are 'assembly' JARs -- they all just contain Hadoop-related code. The distro contains _standalone_ third-party JARs in various `lib/` directories though. I would have expected to see similar notices in `NOTICE.txt` and/or `LICENSE.txt` but there is no mention of any of these third-party libraries. Each JAR contains its own `NOTICE` and/or `LICENSE`, I suppose, and that probably technically satisfies the requirement. I still would have expected this to be reproduced, I think. I'll ping it over to those more knowledgeable to see if anyone thinks that needs a change.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/43449385/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/43450361","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/816#issuecomment-43450361","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/816","id":43450361,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNDUwMzYx","user":{"login":"AmplabJenkins","id":4031291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzEyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4031291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/AmplabJenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-18T20:17:57Z","updated_at":"2014-05-18T20:17:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":" Merged build triggered. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/43450361/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/43450364","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/816#issuecomment-43450364","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/816","id":43450364,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNDUwMzY0","user":{"login":"AmplabJenkins","id":4031291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzEyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4031291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/AmplabJenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-18T20:18:05Z","updated_at":"2014-05-18T20:18:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Merged build started. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/43450364/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/43450504","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/817#issuecomment-43450504","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/817","id":43450504,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNDUwNTA0","user":{"login":"pwendell","id":320616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDYxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/320616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell","html_url":"https://github.com/pwendell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-18T20:24:35Z","updated_at":"2014-05-18T20:24:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"thanks for this - it's a duplicate of #812 though.

One issue with using this approach on Double is the recalculated elements may not have the exact values as those in the original sequence due to rounding error (see below). The original approach used to partition NumericRange doesn't recalculate elements; it simply slices it using `take` and `drop`.  While the implementation of `take` and `drop` may, in turn, involve calculations on `step`, I think it is tricky to get the precision right and that's why we have this bug in Scala. IMHO, if we were to fix it we should fix it in Scala. @mateiz? \n\nPartitioning a Double sequence using your above approach.\n\n```\nscala> (1D to 2D).by(0.2)\nres0:
