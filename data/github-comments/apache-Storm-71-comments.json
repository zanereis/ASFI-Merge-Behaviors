This means it's impossible for the code in read-locked to get a to-be-closed connection since it gets everything by looking at task->node+port first.\n\nThe write-locked code was carefully written this way to minimize the amount of work that actually happens in the write lock. This is important because when that code is active, tasks are prevented from sending messages. The way it is now, it's just setting the value of a single in-memory atom – so basically no work at all. If it were making/closing connections, it would be a completely different story.\n\nIn short, the code in the write-lock is fine – it's the code in the read lock that needs to be fixed.

If that's done, there's no possible way for the sender to get its hands on a connection that's closed or going to be closed while it's using it.</p>\n\n<p>    To elaborate on that last point: once the write lock code is finished, all entries in task->node+port are up to date and accurate, and no connections for those node+ports will be closed. This means it's impossible for the code in read-locked to get a to-be-closed connection since it gets everything by looking at task->node+port first.</p>\n\n<p>    The write-locked code was carefully written this way to minimize the amount of work that actually happens in the write lock. This is important because when that code is active, tasks are prevented from sending messages. The way it is now, it's just setting the value of a single in-memory atom – so basically no work at all. If it were making/closing connections, it would be a completely different story.</p>\n\n<p>    In short, the code in the write-lock is fine – it's the code in the read lock that needs to be fixed. As part of that, the code looking up the node+port for a task needs to be moved back to this function and not happen before the tuple goes on the transfer queue.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612515630/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612515635","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4434#issuecomment-2612515635","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4434","id":2612515635,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI1MTU2MzU=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-30T18:36:19Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T13:19:47Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=githubbot\">githubbot</a>:</i>\n<p>Github user d2r commented on a diff in the pull request:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/349#discussion_r27418768\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/349#discussion_r27418768</a></p>\n\n<p>    &#8212; Diff: storm-core/src/clj/backtype/storm/daemon/worker.clj &#8212;<br/>\n    @@ -302,9 +301,8 @@<br/>\nport)<br/>\n       ]<br/>\n      )))</p>\n<ul class=\"alternate\" type=\"square\">\n\t<li>(write-locked (:endpoint-socket-lock worker)</li>\n\t<li>(reset!

After deploying topology ? and did it caused the supervisor to crash or did you notice the error in the logs. We are catching these exceptions now and it shouldn't crash supervisor and also when you upgraded is there any chance that there is an older storm-core*.jar present in the under STORM_HOME/lib.

Thats exactly the behavior we are looking for . Before this patch we may get into the same scenario as you noted where a worker might die causing supervisor to clear the state and restarting it would result in the topology files not found causing the supervisor to crash. If supervisor is not crashing and downloading the topology bit later that is fine. The reason supervisor might be removing code is if the worker is not sending any heartbeats the assignments for that supervisor might be taken away by nimbus <br/>\nand in that case supervisor will remove the topology jar code.<br/>\n After the last step are you seeing worker to start and topology to run?</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612439145/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/87889571","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/464#issuecomment-87889571","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/464","id":87889571,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3ODg5NTcx","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-31T00:53:45Z","updated_at":"2015-03-31T00:53:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@harshach
