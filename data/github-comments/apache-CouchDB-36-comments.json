I can reliably reproduce the issue by chaining the following curl commands:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncurl -u admin:secret -X PUT -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"name\":\"johndoe@mail.com\",\"password\":\"abc\",\"type\":\"user\",\"roles\":[]}' couchhost:5984/_users/org.couchdb.user:johndoe@mail.com \\\r\n    && curl -u admin:secret -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"field\":\"value\"}' couchhost:5984/userdb-6a6f686e646f65406d61696c2e636f6d\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can also reliably write to it afterwards using the second curl command again: \r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncurl -u admin:secret -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"field\":\"value\"}' couchhost:5984/userdb-6a6f686e646f65406d61696c2e636f6d\r\n```\r\n\r\n`6a6f686e646f65406d61696c2e636f6d` being the hex representation of `johndoe@mail.com`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/355553650/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/355656520","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/1093#issuecomment-355656520","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1093","id":355656520,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NTY1NjUyMA==","user":{"login":"elistevens","id":138016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODAxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/138016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elistevens","html_url":"https://github.com/elistevens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elistevens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elistevens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elistevens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elistevens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elistevens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elistevens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elistevens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elistevens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elistevens/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-05T20:25:21Z","updated_at":"2018-01-05T20:25:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"As Reece noted, while we are currently using 1.6.1 in production, we're intending to move to 2.1.x as soon as our blocking issues (#745 and this, so far) are resolved.

Since get_db_info goes through `couch_server` process. For clusters with big number of databases opening all of them at the same time would cause a series of evictions from `couch_lru`. This in its turn causes lots of update_lru messages to couch_server. \r\n\r\nWe could try to modify `couch_db:get_db_info` to open database in read only mode without using `couch_server`.

wonder if accepting `keys` should only be part of a `POST` body. I think this has two advantages:\r\ni) It avoids the URL length limitations that we've seen previously with including long lists of keys in a URL.\r\nii) It also avoids URL encoding work for the caller (although admittedly that is less of an issue with a DB name than with, for example, view keys).\r\n\r\nThis would be consistent with `_all_docs` and `_view` which allow `POST` of a list of keys. Whilst those endpoints also support `keys` as a query parameter I think that is only for backwards compatibility - so for a new API accepting `POST` only for `keys` could make the most sense.\r\n\r\nIMO one of the pain points in using the CouchDB API in the past has been changes in the response schema for the same endpoint (based on e.g. a query parameter). It seems like this is proposing to introduce yet another example of this similar problem:\r\n`_all_dbs` -> `[\"db1\", \"db2\"]` (list of strings)\r\n`_all_dbs?info=true` -> [{\"key\": \"db1\", \"info\": {...}}, {\"key\": \"db2\", \"info\": {...}}]` (list of objects)\r\n\r\nI think using a new endpoint e.g. `_all_dbs_info` (or whatever) makes a more usable API because it can be made clear that the returned schema is different than that used for `_all_dbs`. Further, given that it appears this operation isn't even going to be allowed for cases where there are more than 100 DBs, then something like `_dbs_info` makes more sense as a name than `_all_dbs` (since it isn't necessarily going to be all the DBs).\r\n\r\nCombining the above with the concern that this should probably be limited to avoid retrieving metadata for all the DBs at once under most circumstances then perhaps a more intuitive API would be one that only accepts a list of keys e.g.:\r\n\r\n`POST` `_dbs_info` `{\"keys\" : [\"dbName1\", \"dbName2\"]}`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/357691338/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/357698399","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/1082#issuecomment-357698399","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1082","id":357698399,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NzY5ODM5OQ==","user":{"login":"jiangphcn","id":18000622,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDAwNjIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18000622?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangphcn","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangphcn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangphcn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangphcn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangphcn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangphcn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangphcn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangphcn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangphcn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangphcn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangphcn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-15T14:30:55Z","updated_at":"2018-01-15T14:30:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ricellis good suggestions from API's point of view.\r\n```\r\nPOST _dbs_info {\"keys\" : [\"dbName1\", \"dbName2\"]}\r\n```\r\nPing @davisp @rnewson @mikerhodes for further comments.\r\n\r\nIf not, I can continue to change to provide above new API :-)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/357698399/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/357701670","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/1068#issuecomment-357701670","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1068","id":357701670,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NzcwMTY3MA==","user":{"login":"jiangphcn","id":18000622,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDAwNjIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18000622?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangphcn","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangphcn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangphcn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangphcn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangphcn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangphcn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangphcn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangphcn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangphcn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangphcn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangphcn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-15T14:43:07Z","updated_at":"2018-01-15T14:43:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@janl Hey Jan, when you get time, can you please check whether you have comments on this?

Some things to check:\r\n\r\n1. Did you restart CouchDB at any point? Perhaps it picked up a different configuration that changed where its storing databases?\r\n2. If you remember either database name, can you try `locate dbname.couch` to see if those files exist somewhere?\r\n3. Can you check your logs to see if there are any DELETE requests?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/357784446/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/357793594","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/1085#issuecomment-357793594","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1085","id":357793594,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1Nzc5MzU5NA==","user":{"login":"davisp","id":19929,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19929?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp","html_url":"https://github.com/davisp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-15T21:31:01Z","updated_at":"2018-01-15T21:31:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Well, offset certainly doesn't make any sense.

In 2.x replicator doesn't use hearbeats, instead it uses timeouts:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/couchdb/blob/master/src/couch_replicator/src/couch_replicator_api_wrap.erl#L486\r\n\r\nNotice that it uses a timeout for the changes feed and the value of the timeout is 1/3 of the `connection_timeout`. By default connection timeout is 30s so the timeout for the _changes feed ends up being 10s.\r\n\r\nTry re-running test script with a timeout parameter specified instead instead of a heartbeat. \r\n\r\nI just tested it a few days ago investigating a similar issue in 2.1.x and noticed that server responds quickly with a `results` and periodic newlines are being sent, keeping the connection alive. In my case I was also looking at a continuous change feed (because the replication was a continuous one as well). Wonder if there is a difference in behavior between a continuous and a normal one in respect to filters. \r\n\r\nBesides the timeout vs heartbeat, and continuous vs normal, a few more questions to get a better idea of what's happening:\r\n\r\n * To double check, is the replication itself running on a 2.x cluster? What are the versions of the targets and source? Are they all 2.x as well?\r\n\r\n * Are there any proxies or load balancers involved and do you think they could affect the connections?\r\n\r\n * How many replication jobs are running? CouchDB 2.x uses a scheduling replicator with a default maximum number of jobs set to 500. If there are more than 500 some tasks will be stopped and some started periodically. In case of filtered replications, with large source db and a restrictive filter, like you have, replications won't checkpoint unless they receive a document update via the filter. However if it takes too long and the job is swapped out by the scheduler, it might not have  chance to checkpoint, it will be stopped. Next time starts will use 0 for the changes feed start 0, and it will wait again, not get a document, will be stopped, etc. In this case you can try for example to increase max_jobs to a number high enough to fit all the replications jobs you have.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/358012819/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/358023515","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/1099#issuecomment-358023515","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1099","id":358023515,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1ODAyMzUxNQ==","user":{"login":"davisp","id":19929,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19929?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp","html_url":"https://github.com/davisp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-16T16:40:01Z","updated_at":"2018-01-16T16:40:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"1.

@wohali ,\r\n\r\nI have not yet tested against 1.7.1. Our application is safe to use 1.6.1 since we operate an internal couchDB instance (no external world access), but we are wanting to move to 2.1.x as soon as is feasible. See @elistevens message above. \r\n\r\nI will get a 1.7.1 environment up and running to test; however, I anticipate we will still have the issues seen above since there are problems with both 1.6.1 and 2.1.1. I'll let you know what I find.\r\n\r\nI should have clarified in my earlier message, we definitely aren't requesting an additional 1.x release. I wanted to include 1.6.1 and 2.1.1 information since we noticed abnormal behavior on both versions and thought the extra information could be useful for an investigation. Currently, the blocking issue we are experiencing is that the server crashes during highly concurrent replication.\r\n\r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/358082066/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/358084077","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/1018#issuecomment-358084077","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1018","id":358084077,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1ODA4NDA3Nw==","user":{"login":"wohali","id":112292,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjI5Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112292?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali","html_url":"https://github.com/wohali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-16T19:52:15Z","updated_at":"2018-01-16T19:52:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"CouchDB's OAuth implementation was outdated, unmaintained and (in some regards) faulty.\r\n\r\nCouchDB 2.x implements a proxy authentication mechanism.

Perhaps the URL is being mangled somehow by httpie.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/358089360/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/358089657","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/1040#issuecomment-358089657","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1040","id":358089657,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1ODA4OTY1Nw==","user":{"login":"wohali","id":112292,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjI5Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112292?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali","html_url":"https://github.com/wohali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-16T20:12:00Z","updated_at":"2018-01-16T20:12:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I believe this is a duplicate of #979.
