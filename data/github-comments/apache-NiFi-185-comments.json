I plan to follow up with a pass at the code.\r\n\r\n- The sample flow attached to the JIRA was really helpful to me to give a sense of the depth of permutations.  It occurs to me that those nine sample configurations might form the basis of some helpful user documentation.  Something like a table that describes, for a particular `EncryptContent` configuration, what an equivalent `DecryptContentEncoded`/`DecryptContentCompatibility` configuration should be.\r\n\r\n  - EncryptContent \r\nKey Derivation Function = NiFi Legacy KDF\r\nEncryption Algorithm = MD5_DES\r\n\r\n  - DecryptContentCompatibilityMode\r\nEncryption Scheme = PBE_WITH_MD5_AND_DES\r\nKey Derivation Strategy = JASYPT_STANDARD\r\n\r\n  If not in the user documentation somewhere, maybe some other reference-able place.  The nine samples give a good sense of the configurability; no need to document every permutation.\r\n\r\n- After a FlowFile has gone through an encrypt / decrypt processor pair, should any of the `encryptcontent.*` attributes be stripped out of the FF attribute set?  Not sure if that breaks an existing FF convention, but if those are left over, they might confuse downstream processors, or lead to IV reuse, for example.\r\n\r\n- It looks like the encryption algorithms are specified in `EncryptionMethod` (for `EncryptContent`) and `CompatibilityModeEncryptionScheme` (for `DecryptContentCompatibilityMode`).  What do you think of these being alphabetized in the UI listbox?  The choices matching `DecryptContentCompatibilityMode` `PBE_WITH_MD5_*` appear in two separate groupings in the UI listbox.\r\n\r\n- `org.jasypt` has released a `1.9.3` version.  Might this be a good time to consider bumping the version dependency?\r\n\r\n- When specifying a raw key (for `Key Specification Format`), it might be nice for the tooltip to provide a hint as to the number of hex characters expected.  There might not be a single answer, given that many algorithms (AES) have implementations with multiple key sizes.  Maybe some blurb along the lines of:\r\n  > Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) keys are symmetric keys that can be three different key lengths (128, 192, or 256 bits).\r\n\r\n  This may be better handled as follow on work.\r\n\r\n- In my usage testing, I was swapping back and forth between use of `Password` versus `Raw Key (hexidecimal)`, using parameters `#{MyPassword}` and `#{MyRawKey}`.  These are two distinct properties in `EncryptContent`.  But in `DecryptContentEncoded`, one property is overridden to provide storage for both `Key Specification Format` options.  It might be nice for these to be two distinct properties, so changing the format does not require changing the key specification value.  These could be presented in the UI the same way using `PropertyDependency`.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1401120102/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1401239864","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6053#issuecomment-1401239864","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6053","id":1401239864,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5ThTk4","user":{"login":"davyam","id":32827630,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyODI3NjMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32827630?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davyam","html_url":"https://github.com/davyam","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davyam/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davyam/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davyam/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davyam/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davyam/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davyam/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davyam/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davyam/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davyam/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-24T01:17:16Z","updated_at":"2023-01-24T01:17:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> @shilpaprotiviti if the processor is so urgent for you: I build and uploaded the NAR directly [here](https://github.com/apache/nifi/files/10325786/nifi-cdc-postgresql-nar-1.20.0-SNAPSHOT.nar.zip).

I agree that including some additional documentation for these Processors describing the mapping between configuration settings would be helpful. Creating additional details documents for these two Processors seems like a good starting location. There is more general encryption documentation in the Administrator's Guide, which could be updated separately when we are ready to deprecate the EncryptContent Processor.\r\n\r\n2. The EncryptContent FlowFile attributes were at one time intended to support simplified integration, but that was never completed implemented. The Initialization Vector cannot be configured in the DecryptContent Processors, and both expect to read it from the FlowFile content. For these reasons, I don't think it is necessary to remove any of the attributes that EncryptContent applies.\r\n\r\n3. The EncryptionMethod values have retained their current order for a long time, so I think those should remain unchanged. However, I agree that the values for DecryptContentCompatibilityMode should be alphabetized, so I will make those changes.\r\n\r\n4. The jasypt dependency is not actually used, so I created [NIFI-11090](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11090) to remove the dependency.\r\n\r\n5. With the DecryptContent Processors, any raw hexadecimal key must match the value used for encryption. Adding a note might be helpful as a follow on effort, but I'm not sure it is particularly helpful given that it should already be known, otherwise decryption will fail.\r\n\r\n6. I considered having separate properties versus sharing the same property and interpreting it based on the `Key Specification Format` property. I would not expect the value and format to change in normal usage, so it seems more straightforward to keep the current approach, as opposed to introducing a separate property. If you think it would be significantly better to have a separate property, and have both properties depend on the format property, I can look at making those changes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1402036808/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1402094678","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6881#issuecomment-1402094678","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6881","id":1402094678,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5TkkRW","user":{"login":"ChrisSamo632","id":12159006,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTU5MDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12159006?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632","html_url":"https://github.com/ChrisSamo632","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-24T15:04:48Z","updated_at":"2023-01-24T15:04:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Thanks for the feedback and testing @ChrisSamo632!\r\n> \r\n> I considered changing the Default Key Store Type to PKCS12 as part of this commit, but decided to leave it as JKS for now.

With focus on the NiFi 1.20 release, I was waiting for some additional input from @turcsanyip.\r\n\r\nConsidering the proposed changes from another perspective, I'm also wondering about the copy-from-url feature from a usability perspective. Although the end result is putting a blob in the destination, the copy effectively ignores the input FlowFile content if I am following the implementation. For a new user, this may not be the most intuitive approach if the desired capability is to copy from one URL to another. Although the destination URL might be the same in the case of using FlowFile content, the expected flow design would be different. It can be challenging to decide when it makes sense to bundle functionality in one Processors, versus creating a new one, but at this point, a new Processor still seems like a better approach.

The Sniffer only returns the hostname and port number (no protocol) so we have to tell it whether to use `http` or `https` when generating the host URL - for this, I'm using the \"first\" of the specified `HTTP_HOSTS` and checking whether it starts with `https://` (otherwise assuming it's `http://`) - I'll add a note to the `Sniffer` property to indicate that all `HTTP_HOSTS` must use the same protocol (which I suspect NiFi and probably Elasticsearch would struggle with anyway if they didn't).\r\n\r\nLooking at the IP in your error message, I'm guessing you're running Elasticsearch as a Docker container, is NiFi running in the same Docker network (although if NiFi can connect to the same Elasticsearch instance when the Sniffer is **not** configured, then I suspect it's not a networking issue)?\r\n\r\nThe Sniffer uses the `Nodes Info` API in Elasticsearch, the only [pre-requisite](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/cluster-nodes-info.html#cluster-nodes-info-api-prereqs) for use is that if Elasticsearch Security is enabled (default to `true` in 8.x) then the user connecting must have the `monitor` or `manage` [cluster privilege](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-cluster) to successfully list the cluster nodes - I'll note this in the `Sniffer` property too. But I'd expect that to throw a `403` (or similar) error response rather than causing a connection timeout.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1426428989/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1426492811","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6658#issuecomment-1426492811","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6658","id":1426492811,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5VBo2L","user":{"login":"ChrisSamo632","id":12159006,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTU5MDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12159006?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632","html_url":"https://github.com/ChrisSamo632","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-10T23:35:45Z","updated_at":"2023-02-10T23:36:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The `integration-tests` (with update `verifySniffer` logic) just revealed that the Elasticsearch instance's `network.publish_address` **must** be one of the `network.bind_address`(es) for the Sniffer to work - this wasn't the case by default for the TestContainer running Elasticsearch, so it could be an issue like that - again, I've added a note to the `Sniffer` property and the `integration-tests` now set `network.bind_address` to [_site_](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-network.html#network-interface-values), which allows them to pass on both Elasticsearch 7.x and 8.x (no TLS but with Auth enabled)\r\n\r\nGoing back to the earlier Docker question - is it that you're running Elasticsearch as a Docker container but NiFi \"natively\" on your machine, connecting to Elasticsearch using `localhost` and then the Elasticsearch instance is reporting back the Docker-internal address of `172.17.0.3`? What do you see under the `http` section of the response from a call to your Elasticsearch's `GET /_nodes/http` API?\r\n\r\nWith an Elasticsearch Docker container running, I get:\r\n```json\r\n\"http\": {\r\n  \"bound_address\": [\r\n    \"0.0.0.0:9200\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"publish_address\": \"172.20.0.2:9200\",\r\n  \"max_content_length_in_bytes\": 104857600\r\n}\r\n```\r\nwhich isn't contactable from my browser/terminal - so I suspect this is indeed what's going on for you, i.e. your Elasticsearch instance is reporting back its \"internal\" IP as its `publish_address` and you'd need to re-configure the instance's `network.publish_address` (or run NiFi within the Docker network **or** use the `host` network for your Elasticsearch container) so that the correct combination of `publish_address` and host network routing can be used","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1426492811/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
