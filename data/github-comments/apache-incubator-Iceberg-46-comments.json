Please note default Java 8 concrete clock classes like `Clock.fixed` are immutable.\r\n\r\nUnit tests no longer have to perform busy wait or sleep like the following:\r\n```\r\n  // t1: append and commit\r\n  // busy wait or sleep\r\n  // t2: append and commit\r\n  // busy wait or sleep\r\n  // expire snapshot before current time\r\n```\r\nInstead the tests will look like:\r\n```\r\n  // t1: append and commit\r\n  // advance test clock by 1ms\r\n  // t1+1: append and commit\r\n  // advance test clock by 1ms\r\n  // expire snapshot before current time (t1+2)\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```\r\n  // set the test clock to t1\r\n  // t1: append and commit\r\n  // set the test clock to t2\r\n  // t2: append and commit\r\n  // expire snapshot before t2+1\r\n```\r\nThe unit tests can simulate running in the future, in the past, or in any arbitrary point in time.

I'd prefer to remove `Serializable` from the appender factory interface first, though. And it would be nice to get some of the other comments fixed or clarified (some are questions since I'm learning about how Flink works).

For example, if I have a table that is sorted by `id ASC NULLS FIRST`, that would get sort order ID 0. If an older client writes, then that gets erased and the next reader assumes that the table is unordered.\r\n\r\nErasing the sort order is an annoyance right now. But if we use the sort order for delete files and data files, then this could turn into a correctness problem. Say a table has a data file sorted by `id ASC NULLS FIRST` and labelled with `sort_order_id = 0` in manifests. When the sort order gets erased or replaced, there is no longer any tracking for what ID 0 meant. If I then add an unsorted equality delete file it may also get `sort_order_id = 0` in its metadata. Then it would appear that the deletes can be merged instead of using a delete set because the order matches between the data file and the delete file when it actually does not.\r\n\r\nI can think of two solutions. First, we could add sort orders to v1, but require them for v2 like we do for the partition spec list. That way, all v2 writers will guarantee that sort orders are not dropped and we no longer have a problem. The second option is to assign sort order IDs using a hash so two orders would not collide.\r\n\r\nI think I prefer the first option.

I think the current implementation is fairly clean and I like how it injects the clock through `TableOperations`.

I don't know of any use cases that would use a clock to inject custom timestamp logic, so adding this through `TableOperations` adds unnecessary complexity to an interface that is extended by external libraries. I am also not sure that this is the best option for tests because it isn't obvious what relationship the clock has to the other operations because it is passed in at table creation time through the superclass.
