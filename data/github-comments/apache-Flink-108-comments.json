Its probably just a configuration setting of the cassandra driver to fail after a certain amount of time.\n- We should probably introduce a (configurable) limit (nr. records / some gb's) for the write ahead log. It seemed to me, that due to the failed other instance, no checkpoints were able to complete anymore (because some of the cassandra sinks were stuck in the notifyCheckpointComplete()), while other's were accepting data into the WAL. This lead to a lot of data being written into the statebackend. I think the cassandra sink should stop at some point in such a situation.\n\nAlso, I would like to test the exactly once behavior on a cluster more thoroughly. Currently, I've only tested whether the connector is properly failing and restoring, but I didn't test if the written data is actually correct.\n\nHowever, since the code seems to be working under normal operation, I would suggest to merge the connector now, and then file follow up JIRAs for the remaining issues.\nThis makes collaboration and reviews easier and allows our users to help testing the cassandra connector.\n\nSome log:\n\n```\n2016-06-03 12:28:36,478 ERROR org.apache.flink.streaming.runtime.operators.GenericWriteAheadSink  -

There are so many possible DBs and connectors, and it is tough for the community to maintain them all. For that reason, I would suggest to stage such contributions of new and interesting connectors.\n\nCould you put this into an standalone GitHub project for now? We would link this repository from the Apache Flink website and that way make it visible to the Flink community.\nWhen we see that we get frequent requests for a ReThinkDB, we would like to move this to the core Flink code base.\n\nFollowing this idea, we would end up with frequently used connectors in the core Flink repository, and a larger number of connectors in third party community repositories.
