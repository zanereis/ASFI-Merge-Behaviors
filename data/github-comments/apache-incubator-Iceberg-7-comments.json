I was thinking about this and wanted to get your inputs here. \r\n\r\nI was thinking if the implementation would become simpler/cleaner if we maintained the column ids close to the ORC schema. For instance, we could do something similar to Avro schema, where the column ids are maintained as metadata properties tied to each schema element. This, of course, is not possible today with ORC's `TypeDescription`. But, let's say we exposed a `RichTypeDescription` schema for ORC instead of its standard `TypeDescription`. The `RichTypeDescription` would maintain metadata properties for each schema field, similar to Avro. This metadata property will hold the column ids. This could help get rid of the separate map which we have to maintain, can possibly also make things simpler when we have to address schema evolution [by id] during read where we'd have to make use of visitors, similar to Avro. \r\n\r\nThe big benefit I see is that we don't have to expose two data structures or spread the schema information across two classes.  \r\n\r\nAnother potential benefit of this approach is, if we can get the ORC community to adopt a patch which attaches  metadata per field, then we can completely get rid of our own `RichTypeDescription` without changing our code drastically.

Today, we are serializing a  Map, we could just as well serialize a json as you mentioned.  But the schema class that we construct should have the field ids [as described above]. I'm just curious whether having a single schema class with ids instead of a Map and a schema class would make future and current changes simpler.\r\n\r\nI'm also totally fine by first trying to fix ORC first before we make any changes here.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/504712756/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/504736494","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/226#issuecomment-504736494","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/226","id":504736494,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNDczNjQ5NA==","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-23T09:54:07Z","updated_at":"2019-06-23T09:54:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've removed `AbbreviationAsWordInName` and reverted changes required by that rule.\r\n\r\nAlso, the PR description contains a few points I want to bring attention on Scala formatting in Baseline.
