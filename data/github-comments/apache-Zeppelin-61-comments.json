is WIP.\n\nI'd like to get feedback on the approach (scala implementation in the current spark module), taking into consideration:\n- Spark 2.0 will ship by defaulit on scala 2.11 (makes sense to me to develop the interpeter on scala 2.11)\n- SqlContext and HiveContext are deprected in favor of SparkSession.\n- HttpServer is removed and some classes methods have access restricted to spark only packages.\n- SpakIMain and SparkJLineCompletion don't exist anymore.\n\nBuilding on the current java classes with method invocation may be possible, but would make the code more than difficult to read and develop.\n\nThis PR proposes separated scala classes for this very specific 2.0 API breaking changes.\n\nWDYT?\n\nBased on feedback, I will further validate the functionalities (for now, a simple
