I'll fix it. Concerning the modes, in an early stage of Spark, there're some different behaviours of different modes, thus we need to test Zeppelin with Spark in a standalone cluster, but for now, Spark become stable and if different modes have different behaviours, it's definitely Spark's problem and Spark should fix it. Thus I don't think we need to test Zeppelin a cluster mode. Furthermore, personally, I don't know what benefit we have in a different test environment between local and CI. In case of Python, I've experienced that some tests only failed in CI, not in a local with different setting between them.
