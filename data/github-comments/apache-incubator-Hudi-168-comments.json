Would it be possible to keep the feature in a separate module say `hudi-security` and make it useable only when people build Hudi with parquet 1.12? say `-Dcustom.build=true`. The main question here is whether building with parquet 1.12 makes other features work or not.\r\n\r\nKindly share with us any compatibility issues from your testings. cc @vinothchandar @nsivabalan \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/963317139/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/963567587","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/3947#issuecomment-963567587","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3947","id":963567587,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM45bt_j","user":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-08T20:59:24Z","updated_at":"2021-11-08T20:59:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@hudi-bot azure run","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/963567587/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/963580143","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/3938#issuecomment-963580143","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3938","id":963580143,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM45bxDv","user":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-08T21:15:05Z","updated_at":"2021-11-08T21:15:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"sure.

One example (using datasource writer):\r\n```\r\ndf.write(\"org.apache.hudi\")\r\n.options(\r\n  Map(\"hoodie.insert.shuffle.parallelism\" -> \"4\",\r\n          \"hoodie.upsert.shuffle.parallelism\"->\"4\",\r\n          \"hoodie.embed.timeline.server.port\"-> \"27055\",\r\n         \"hoodie.filesystem.view.remote.port\" -> \"27054\"\r\n  )\r\n)\r\n.options(\r\n  Map(\r\n    HoodieWriteConfig.TABLE_NAME                    -> \"awv.tf_msm\",\r\n    DataSourceWriteOptions.RECORDKEY_FIELD_OPT_KEY  -> \"tijd_waarneming,unieke_id\",\r\n    DataSourceWriteOptions.PRECOMBINE_FIELD_OPT_KEY -> \"tijd_laatst_gewijzigd\",\r\n    DataSourceWriteOptions.TABLE_TYPE_OPT_KEY       -> HoodieTableType.MERGE_ON_READ\r\n  )\r\n)\r\n.option(DataSourceWriteOptions.OPERATION_OPT_KEY, DataSourceWriteOptions.INSERT_OPERATION_OPT_VAL)\r\n.options(\r\n  Map(\r\n   DataSourceWriteOptions.PARTITIONPATH_FIELD_OPT_KEY -> \"tijd_waarneming:TIMESTAMP\",\r\n  DataSourceWriteOptions.KEYGENERATOR_CLASS_OPT_KEY -> classOf[org.apache.hudi.keygen.CustomKeyGenerator].getName,\r\n  \"hoodie.deltastreamer.keygen.timebased.output.dateformat\" -> \"yyyy/MM/dd\",\r\n  \"hoodie.deltastreamer.keygen.timebased.timestamp.type\" -> \"SCALAR\",\r\n  \"hoodie.deltastreamer.keygen.timebased.timestamp.scalar.time.unit\" -> \"microseconds\"\r\n  )\r\n)\r\n.mode(SaveMode.Overwrite)\r\n```\r\n(Could be that there is a typo here or there; reconstructed this through some abstraction layers).\r\nWe read raw files through spark, hence have microsecond timestamps for all our data. We sometimes specify ports since we also run in k8s client mode so executor pods need to be able to contact driver.\r\n\r\nSpark session something like:\r\n```\r\nval conf = new SparkConf()\r\n    conf.setAll(ConfigUtils.dfsADLS2_AuthConfig().iterator.toIterable)\r\n    conf.set(\"spark.scheduler.mode\", \"FAIR\")\r\n    conf.setMaster(\"local[2]\")\r\n    conf.set(\"spark.ui.enabled\", \"false\")\r\n    conf.set(\"spark.serializer\", \"org.apache.spark.serializer.KryoSerializer\")\r\nval builder = SparkSession.builder()\r\nbuilder.config(conf)\r\nval session = builder.getOrCreate()\r\n```\r\nwhere dfsADLS2_AuthConfig() is something like:\r\n```\r\ns\"spark.hadoop.fs.azure.account.auth.type.$storageAccountKey\"              → \"OAuth\",\r\n    s\"spark.hadoop.fs.azure.account.oauth2.client.endpoint.$storageAccountKey\" → s\"https://login.microsoftonline.com/$tenantId/oauth2/token\",\r\n    s\"spark.hadoop.fs.azure.account.oauth.provider.type.$storageAccountKey\"    → \"org.apache.hadoop.fs.azurebfs.oauth2.ClientCredsTokenProvider\",\r\n    s\"spark.hadoop.fs.azure.account.oauth2.client.id.$storageAccountKey\"       → clientId,\r\n    s\"spark.hadoop.fs.azure.account.oauth2.client.secret.$storageAccountKey\"   → clientSecret\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor syncing to hive, I would typically use options like:\r\n```\r\n--base-path abfss://dev@stsdpglasshouse.dfs.core.windows.net/datalakehouse/awv.tf_msm --database degeyt70 --sync-mode hms --partitioned-by year,month,day --spark-datasource --table awv_tf_msm --jdbc-url thrift://localhost:9083 --user hive --pass hive --partition-value-extractor org.apache.hudi.hive.MultiPartKeysValueExtractor\r\n```\r\nWith the `--spark-datasource` options (which disables the `syncAsSparkDataSourceTable`), I can query everything OK. Without it, it fails. Same behavior if I sync using DataSourceWriteOptions. I don't use the `--support-timestamp` option for now, since that does not work with `spark.sql.hive.convertMetastoreParquet=false`.\r\n\r\n(Data sample (is open data):\r\n```\r\n    <meetpunt beschrijvende_id=\"H222L10\" unieke_id=\"29\">\r\n        <lve_nr>55</lve_nr>\r\n        <tijd_waarneming>2021-05-05T15:08:00+01:00</tijd_waarneming>\r\n        <tijd_laatst_gewijzigd>2021-05-05T15:09:16+01:00</tijd_laatst_gewijzigd>\r\n        <actueel_publicatie>1</actueel_publicatie>\r\n        <beschikbaar>1</beschikbaar>\r\n        <defect>0</defect>\r\n        <geldig>0</geldig>\r\n        <meetdata klasse_id=\"1\">\r\n            <verkeersintensiteit>0</verkeersintensiteit>\r\n            <voertuigsnelheid_rekenkundig>0</voertuigsnelheid_rekenkundig>\r\n            <voertuigsnelheid_harmonisch>252</voertuigsnelheid_harmonisch>\r\n        </meetdata>\r\n        <meetdata klasse_id=\"2\">\r\n            <verkeersintensiteit>0</verkeersintensiteit>\r\n            <voertuigsnelheid_rekenkundig>0</voertuigsnelheid_rekenkundig>\r\n            <voertuigsnelheid_harmonisch>252</voertuigsnelheid_harmonisch>\r\n        </meetdata>\r\n        <meetdata klasse_id=\"3\">\r\n            <verkeersintensiteit>0</verkeersintensiteit>\r\n            <voertuigsnelheid_rekenkundig>0</voertuigsnelheid_rekenkundig>\r\n            <voertuigsnelheid_harmonisch>252</voertuigsnelheid_harmonisch>\r\n        </meetdata>\r\n        <meetdata klasse_id=\"4\">\r\n            <verkeersintensiteit>0</verkeersintensiteit>\r\n            <voertuigsnelheid_rekenkundig>0</voertuigsnelheid_rekenkundig>\r\n            <voertuigsnelheid_harmonisch>252</voertuigsnelheid_harmonisch>\r\n        </meetdata>\r\n        <meetdata klasse_id=\"5\">\r\n            <verkeersintensiteit>0</verkeersintensiteit>\r\n            <voertuigsnelheid_rekenkundig>0</voertuigsnelheid_rekenkundig>\r\n            <voertuigsnelheid_harmonisch>252</voertuigsnelheid_harmonisch>\r\n        </meetdata>\r\n        <rekendata>\r\n            <bezettingsgraad>0</bezettingsgraad>\r\n            <beschikbaarheidsgraad>100</beschikbaarheidsgraad>\r\n            <onrustigheid>0</onrustigheid>\r\n        </rekendata>\r\n    </meetpunt>\r\n```\r\nBut it happens for all our data sets I've tried till now (JSON, XML...), so not related to spark-xml)\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/964200441/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/964215135","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/3173#issuecomment-964215135","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3173","id":964215135,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM45eMFf","user":{"login":"minihippo","id":17903481,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTAzNDgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17903481?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/minihippo","html_url":"https://github.com/minihippo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minihippo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minihippo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minihippo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minihippo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minihippo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minihippo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minihippo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minihippo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minihippo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-09T14:42:15Z","updated_at":"2021-11-09T14:42:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @nsivabalan，thanks for review.

Carrying over deltastreamer checkpoint. \r\n2. Carrying over any regex (prefix) based extra metadata from previous commit to current one. \r\n\r\nAnd this is used only within multi-writer code path. I don't see this being used in single writer. \r\nGiven we have fixed the (1) above with new config, and multi-writer is an evolving feature, I prefer to go ahead w/ new config. We can add the old config(`hoodie.write.meta.key.prefixes`) as an alternative to the new one, but only (1) will be taken care. We will definitely call this out in release notes. \r\n\r\nIf you feel we definitely need support for (2) above, let me know. I fill file a follow up ticket and work on it. but I prefer to fix for both single writer and multi-writer. not sure why we had a constraint only with multiwriter.

@bvaradar : need your guidance here. \r\nwhen we do getLatestFileSlice().getLogFiles(), can we assume the HoodieLogFile will have the file size set appropriately? \r\n\r\nHere is the context: \r\nThis patch is to avoid a direct fs call within log file reader. the call of interest is used in detecting schema from log file and we do reverse reading and so we do fs.getFileStatus(logFile).getLenth(). I tracked back the call and realized that within HoodieRealtimeInputformatUtils. We have a file slice from which we get log files, at which juncture I fetch the log file length and carry that info all the way to RealTimeSplit and use it in LogReaderUtils and HoodieLogFileReader. \r\n\r\nThis fix worked well until recently we landed [mor-incremental support](https://github.com/apache/hudi/commit/a40ac62e0ce7ec807a00803d23ed223d7c607459) for hive. If not for this recent patch, this PR was in good shape. Specifically, \r\nthe [HoodieLogFile from fileSlice](https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/2d362af00ae61ab76ff45fd83f142d3af4bd0909/hudi-hadoop-mr/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/hadoop/realtime/HoodieParquetRealtimeInputFormat.java#L201) has file size set to 0.  My assumption is that, HoodieLogFile object will always have file size set. \r\nSo, my question is: is there a bug somewhere on this end. or we can't assume length will always be set for HoodieLogFile. greatly appreciate pointers from you folks on this end. \r\n ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/965480577/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/965523413","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/3944#issuecomment-965523413","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3944","id":965523413,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM45jLfV","user":{"login":"hudi-bot","id":79415918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDE1OTE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79415918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/hudi-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-10T16:34:16Z","updated_at":"2021-11-10T16:34:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\nMeta data\n{\n  \"version\" : 1,\n  \"metaDataEntries\" : [ {\n    \"hash\" : \"4b89c3c12016b66e36a1ce3e37fa29dfd8c0c831\",\n    \"status\" : \"DELETED\",\n    \"url\" : \"https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=3212\",\n    \"triggerID\" : \"4b89c3c12016b66e36a1ce3e37fa29dfd8c0c831\",\n    \"triggerType\" : \"PUSH\"\n  }, {\n    \"hash\" : \"d345dd70c71ea2aab383e19558d330ca3bfc1a75\",\n    \"status\" : \"DELETED\",\n    \"url\" : \"https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=3214\",\n    \"triggerID\" : \"d345dd70c71ea2aab383e19558d330ca3bfc1a75\",\n    \"triggerType\" : \"PUSH\"\n  }, {\n    \"hash\" : \"75d2c6ca1cb274a810aff7fcf450dbd46183768a\",\n    \"status\" : \"DELETED\",\n    \"url\" : \"https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=3234\",\n    \"triggerID\" : \"75d2c6ca1cb274a810aff7fcf450dbd46183768a\",\n    \"triggerType\" : \"PUSH\"\n  }, {\n    \"hash\" : \"75d2c6ca1cb274a810aff7fcf450dbd46183768a\",\n    \"status\" : \"DELETED\",\n    \"url\" : \"https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=3246\",\n    \"triggerID\" : \"964092088\",\n    \"triggerType\" : \"MANUAL\"\n  }, {\n    \"hash\" : \"64fc0b0437a08902a3e8f4f2058a20b3c38210dd\",\n    \"status\" : \"DELETED\",\n    \"url\" : \"https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=3248\",\n    \"triggerID\" : \"64fc0b0437a08902a3e8f4f2058a20b3c38210dd\",\n    \"triggerType\" : \"PUSH\"\n  }, {\n    \"hash\" : \"89c46ae0d97d24bd112e505e6db8d53c6c6c023c\",\n    \"status\" : \"SUCCESS\",\n    \"url\" : \"https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=3286\",\n    \"triggerID\" : \"89c46ae0d97d24bd112e505e6db8d53c6c6c023c\",\n    \"triggerType\" : \"PUSH\"\n  } ]\n}-->\n## CI report:\n\n* 89c46ae0d97d24bd112e505e6db8d53c6c6c023c Azure: [SUCCESS](https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=3286) \n\n<details>\n<summary>Bot commands</summary>\n  @hudi-bot supports the following commands:\n\n -
