It seems to me that if we kept some of this structure (like QueryMetricsFactory and DefaultQueryMetrics) but abandoned type safe metric handling, in favor of string keys, then the implementation would be a lot simpler. If we made that change then:\r\n\r\n1. We wouldn't need implementations for each query type with query-specific dimensions, reducing and simplifying code.\r\n2. The important functionality remains: site-specific QueryMetricsFactory impls are still able to have full control over whitelisting, blacklisting, adding to, or modifying existing emitted metrics.\r\n3. Site specific QueryMetricsFactory impls wouldn't need to break on each Druid release. This is both good (less work for operators of custom QueryMetricsFactory impls) and potentially bad (no compile-time notification to operators that a new dimension or metric exists). It's still possible for site specific impls to notice this at runtime, and they could perhaps emit an alert or log a warning. And, I can imagine that there would be some QueryMetricsFactory impls that don't _want_ compile time notification enforcement that they handle new dimensions. Maybe all they want to do is add a dimension but not alter existing ones.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is better or worse than your current patch, but I would at least like to discuss this non-type-safe option.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/288771236/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/288784407","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/4071#issuecomment-288784407","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4071","id":288784407,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4ODc4NDQwNw==","user":{"login":"akashdw","id":5886276,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODYyNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5886276?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akashdw","html_url":"https://github.com/akashdw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akashdw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akashdw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akashdw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akashdw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akashdw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akashdw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akashdw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akashdw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akashdw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-23T16:49:29Z","updated_at":"2017-03-23T16:49:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@gianm testing this patch in one of the production environment, will let you know once done with the testing.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/288784407/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/288785003","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/4095#issuecomment-288785003","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4095","id":288785003,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4ODc4NTAwMw==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-23T16:51:26Z","updated_at":"2017-03-23T16:54:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I raised https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CURATOR-394 with Curator.

Curator 2.12.0 is supposed to fix #4056, #3837 so there is some downside to reverting. But the upside is that it makes upgrading Druid a lot simpler for Tranquility users, since they don't need to upgrade Tranquility first.\r\n- If we stick with Curator 2.12.0, this issue means that Curator service discovery clients need to be updated before services.

With the type safe  \"method hook\" approach, dimensions/metrics which you don't need are zero-cost. With methods accepting Strings, they still have to be computed, and the logic of their computation pollutes the core query execution code. I have a specific case in mind, it's creating \"bitmap construction plan\" strings, presented in this message: https://github.com/druid-io/druid/pull/3754#issue-193979306. We emit such strings as dimension. It adds quite a lot of logic, and supposedly not very cheap (though I didn't measure): involves creating and populating TreeMaps, etc. I would like to completely hide this logic and complexity in our own implementation of `TopNQueryMetrics`.\r\n\r\nIf site specific QueryMetrics don't want to break on each Druid release, they may inherit from `DefaultQueryMetrics`, or `DefaultTopNQueryMetrics`, etc. Those classes act as adapter implementations as well.

So either we need to rethink some logic using responseContext now, or have two responseContexts: \"before\" and \"after\", that would be too complex IMO.\r\n\r\nIn #3803 I was using it to pass what is now known as `QueryMetrics`. However I should have used Query context for this, or add a specific `QueryMetrics` property to `Query`.

I think that is not nessnary to benchmark those changes in the `PR`.

One option I thought of is to let KafkaSupervisor report the offsets to the brokers by `consumer.commitSync(Map<TopicPartition,OffsetAndMetadata> offsets)` so that readily available monitoring tools would work.   The offset in the broker is for the monitoring purpose only.  The supervisor should never read them out.
