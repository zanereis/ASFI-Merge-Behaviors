destination%5Fbackfill fails, but that is not really a nimbus issue. The client is sending a get request with already decoded url so client sends denstination_backfill which is what master looks for and fails. The decoding happens as part of topology.html which tries to construct a new url by decoding the windows own url using purl.js</p>\n\n<p>destination%F5backfill fails because purl.js is trying to decode a non encoded string. </p>\n\n<p>Even if we encode the url on server side , purl.js decodes it twice once during the data: phase and then during the param: extraction phase. So for a string like Even if we encode the url on server side , purl.js decodes it twice so destination%5Fbackfill is encoded to destination%255Fbackfill on server side. This gets decoded twice on client side converting to original destination%5Fbackfill in the first data phase and then to destination_backfill which is the string sent to nimbus.</p>\n\n<p>We either need to fix purl.js library or move to ajax.url. I haven't yet had success with ajax.url but not sure what the root cause is in that library.</p>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612482244/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612468802","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4182#issuecomment-2612468802","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4182","id":2612468802,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI0Njg4MDI=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-22T23:54:05Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T12:55:17Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=jwellington\">jwellington</a>:</i>\n<p>There is already an API to submit Topologies programmatically through the Thrift Interface to Nimbus:</p>\n\n<p>See Thrift definition here:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/apache/incubator-storm/blob/master/storm-core/src/storm.thrift\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/incubator-storm/blob/master/storm-core/src/storm.thrift</a></p>\n\n<p>I have done this myself before.

So to submit changes, you would need to attach patch files to JIRA (unlike our github workflow). As I mentioned, this will change.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some rough steps to how to generate/debug the site:</p>\n\n<p>Checkout the Storm svn repo (this only contains the website, not the code):</p>\n\n<div class=\"code panel\" style=\"border-width: 1px;\"><div class=\"codeContent panelContent\">\n<pre class=\"code-java\">svn co https:<span class=\"code-comment\">//svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/storm storm-website</span>\n</pre>\n</div></div>\n\n<p>The site is statically generated using jekyll. I have version 1.3.1 installed, but newer versions may be okay. To install jekyll:</p>\n\n<div class=\"code panel\" style=\"border-width: 1px;\"><div class=\"codeContent panelContent\">\n<pre class=\"code-java\">gem install jekyll -v ‘1.3.1’\n</pre>\n</div></div>\n\n<p>To run the jekyll web server and have it regenerate automatically whenever any file changes:</p>\n\n<div class=\"code panel\" style=\"border-width: 1px;\"><div class=\"codeContent panelContent\">\n<pre class=\"code-java\">cd storm-website/site\njekyll serve -w\n</pre>\n</div></div>\n\n<p>You can view the site locally at:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://localhost:4000\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://localhost:4000</a></p>\n\n<p>(by default, jekyll will write generated files to the “_site” directory. This is not under version control — only for local development.)</p>\n\n<p>When you are ready to publish, generate the site to the “publish” directory:</p>\n\n<div class=\"code panel\" style=\"border-width: 1px;\"><div class=\"codeContent panelContent\">\n<pre class=\"code-java\">jekyll build -d publish\n</pre>\n</div></div>\n\n<p>The publish directory is under version control. Apache svnpubsub is setup to watch that directory and update the website whenever it changes.</p>\n\n<p>To publish the changes just add/commit any new or modified files. </p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612484278/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612484280","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4294#issuecomment-2612484280","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4294","id":2612484280,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI0ODQyODA=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-23T22:11:54Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T13:03:26Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=ptgoetz\">ptgoetz</a>:</i>\n<p><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=amontalenti\" class=\"user-hover\" rel=\"amontalenti\">Andrew Montalenti</a>, I assigned this to you since you seemed interested.
