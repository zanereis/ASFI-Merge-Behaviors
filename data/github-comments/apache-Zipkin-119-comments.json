I was testing more of the functionality and realized that ignoring the array value in the tags is not what should happen. Instead I changed it so that it parses the array so that it can be viewable in the tags. Now I can see the array value in the tags but the value is not searchable. For example, if I have `tags: { ids: [1, 2, 3]}` I won't be able to search for 1, 2, or 3 by providing the query `_q: id=1` or `_q: id=2` or `_q: id=3`. None of these would return results with the fix I made. So I looked deeper and though to change the Map value type for the `annotationQuery` to type Object. This is so it can have a type array returned when calling the method `parseAnnotationQuery` in the class `QueryRequest`. Changing the map value type required me to change it in several files to get it to compile. But after all that it is still not searchable even though I provide the value as an array when returning from `parseAnnotationQuery`. Any ideas on what else I need to change to get this working so I can search multiple value fields for any tag?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/1531594114/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/1554706964","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/3538#issuecomment-1554706964","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3538","id":1554706964,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAEXUMc5cqvIU","user":{"login":"darkmastermindz","id":6164335,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNjQzMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6164335?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkmastermindz","html_url":"https://github.com/darkmastermindz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkmastermindz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkmastermindz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkmastermindz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkmastermindz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkmastermindz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkmastermindz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkmastermindz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkmastermindz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkmastermindz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-19T14:49:45Z","updated_at":"2023-05-19T14:49:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@llinder Here's an additional CVE as part of spring, would like to see the workflow run to see if it checks out or if it needs more work.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/1554706964/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/1555100642","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/3538#issuecomment-1555100642","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3538","id":1555100642,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAEXUMc5csPPi","user":{"login":"darkmastermindz","id":6164335,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNjQzMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6164335?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkmastermindz","html_url":"https://github.com/darkmastermindz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkmastermindz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkmastermindz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkmastermindz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkmastermindz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkmastermindz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkmastermindz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkmastermindz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkmastermindz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkmastermindz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-19T18:58:45Z","updated_at":"2023-05-19T18:58:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Okay, it seems like there may be some additional steps.

Probably what we wan't to check instead is `.doesNotContain(\"uri=\\\"/prometheus\")`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/1568562720/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/1568715056","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/3538#issuecomment-1568715056","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3538","id":1568715056,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAEXUMc5dgLEw","user":{"login":"llinder","id":99359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/llinder","html_url":"https://github.com/llinder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/llinder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/llinder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/llinder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/llinder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/llinder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/llinder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/llinder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/llinder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/llinder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-30T16:16:22Z","updated_at":"2023-05-30T16:16:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@darkmastermindz I opened a PR against your branch that should fix it https://github.com/darkmastermindz/zipkin/pull/1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/1568715056/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/1568807192","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/3540#issuecomment-1568807192","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3540","id":1568807192,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAEXUMc5dghkY","user":{"login":"llinder","id":99359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/llinder","html_url":"https://github.com/llinder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/llinder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/llinder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/llinder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/llinder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/llinder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/llinder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/llinder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/llinder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/llinder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-30T17:28:03Z","updated_at":"2023-05-30T17:28:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@jcchavezs this issue came up in the laster merge I made.

Apologies if this is the wrong place.\r\n\r\nI am trying to integrate zipkin into a RabbitMQ configured with **Mutual TLS**. The above describes some updated support where zipkin uses the dummy 'trust everything' TrustManager, which is fine. My problem is that the current approach, I think, is hard coded to set up a dummy/empty KeyStore.\r\n\r\nThis means that our RabbitMQ rejects the connection because it doesn't see an acceptable client certificate coming from Zipkin client.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to update the ZipkinRabbitMQCollectorProperties or equivalent to optionally create an SSLContext that uses the dummy trust manager, but allows a 'real' KeyStore to be configured?  and then call connectionFactory.useSslProtocol, specifying the SSLContext just created? Or some other mechaism to allow a KeyStore to be injected?\r\n\r\nI tried setting JAVA_OPTS to default to a keystore file, but it is just ignored by the hard-coded logic\r\n\r\nIf there is another approach or workaround already in use I'd be grateful to hear about it","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/1598975151/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/1601628758","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/3548#issuecomment-1601628758","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3548","id":1601628758,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAEXUMc5fdupW","user":{"login":"darkmastermindz","id":6164335,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNjQzMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6164335?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkmastermindz","html_url":"https://github.com/darkmastermindz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkmastermindz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkmastermindz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkmastermindz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkmastermindz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkmastermindz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkmastermindz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkmastermindz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkmastermindz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkmastermindz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-21T20:31:00Z","updated_at":"2023-06-21T20:31:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jcchavezs
