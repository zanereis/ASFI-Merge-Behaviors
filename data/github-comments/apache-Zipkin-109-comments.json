So, this is more a formalization effort.\r\n\r\nWe could consider a tag \"server.host/name\", which could be more general (for RPC and MySQL) too...\r\n* the HTTP \"host\" header\r\n* the authority of the URL\r\n* the SNI server name presented during the SSL handshake by the client.\r\n\r\nThis wouldn't prevent an additional/alternative tag for \"http.authority/host\", just be\r\nmore general purpose for CLIENT/PRODUCER spans (for RPC and MySQL) too.\r\n\r\nUsing the word \"server\" allows people to see this is the client point of view, and could\r\nhelp avoid data problems where otherwise someone might tag a SERVER span incorrectly.\r\n\r\nWhile \"server.host\" or \"server.name\" isn't perfect (ex it *should* be \"broker.host\" in\r\nmessaging), I think that partial nuance can be cleared up in docs.\r\n\r\nFor value validation, we can say that this is not an IP address, rather to use remoteEndpoint for that.\r\nHowever, we'd probably end up with port info here, as that's a natural component of URL authority.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/646964063/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/646964930","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2167#issuecomment-646964930","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2167","id":646964930,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0Njk2NDkzMA==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-20T08:52:45Z","updated_at":"2020-06-20T08:52:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"To punt a specific plan of action. 👍 this comment if you want the following. reply back if you want something different instead!\r\n\r\ndefine \"server.host\" tag with only the host (not the port part) as defined on the client side.

It is still invalid, but the trace should render.\r\n\r\nwe've had users think that because our data format permits certain fields like localEndpoint and timestamp to be absent, that means the data is valid. It isn't valid, but there's a different question about whether the UI should crash (shouldn't) or what the UI should do about it (skip or backfill based on some heuristic)\r\n\r\nThe reason it can be confusing is that spans can be reported twice. ex `span.flush()` followed by `span.finish()`. There are 2 json in this case and span-cleaner in lens will merge those as one. This means that if one or the other has a timestamp, we are fine.\r\n\r\nSpans that never started are a bug, in other words. Spans reported twice are not necessarily a bug. In any case a missing timestamp shouldn't crash the UI for the trace.\r\n\r\nGiven this, should we merge the change?\r\n\r\ncc @jorgheymans as being the issue-master this topic is an important and frequently misunderstood one. I'm even thinking about finding a place in our openapi docs to double or triple underscore that nullability of a field does not imply it is good data to leave it out. Somehow we need to clearly say that \"patching\" a span can happen and in that case, consider the merged data when thinking of how to interpret fields.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/647208252/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/647227490","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3023#issuecomment-647227490","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3023","id":647227490,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0NzIyNzQ5MA==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-22T02:11:56Z","updated_at":"2020-06-22T02:11:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I'm going to close this issue as it helps the team focus on issues to progress.

This is not unlike problems we had in OpenTracing\r\n\r\nConcretely, this literal example OpenTelemetry use would end up indexed in ES or Cassandra:\r\n`\"my-event-name\": { \"key1\" : \"value1\", \"key2\": \"value2\" }`\r\n\r\n\r\nSo in short, it might make sense to create a keyword based struct, which at least allows disabling annotations as currently we should expect to see much more low-value load caused by OpenTelemetry otherwise.\r\n\r\ncc @openzipkin/core ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/647260844/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/647829945","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/3125#issuecomment-647829945","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3125","id":647829945,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0NzgyOTk0NQ==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-23T00:07:33Z","updated_at":"2020-06-23T00:07:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"thanks for the look @anuraaga and @jorgheymans!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/647829945/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/649134088","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3128#issuecomment-649134088","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3128","id":649134088,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0OTEzNDA4OA==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-24T23:54:01Z","updated_at":"2020-06-24T23:54:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think we should look at existing loggers (like zipkin2.collector which\nlogs errors at debug) and also the more detailed Prometheus metrics first\nbefore adding a new variable and another custom thing.\n\nProbably we can add some notes about the general process of troubleshooting\nwhich is more metrics first.\n\nWhen the issue was discussed on chat 100pct of spans were dropped. with an\nalways log errors thing it would be dumping errors into the console at the\nrate of traffic which is a reason why we dont do this.\n\nOn Wed, Jun 24, 2020, 10:57 PM Simon Dean <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> *Feature:*\n> Zipkin Server includes a ES_HTTP_LOGGING setting to configure logging for\n> Zipkin Server's HTTP requests to Elasticsearch.

It's along these lines https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1484 , but i'm more thinking a separate endpoint where you would upload a trace or give it the id of a trace that isn't showing and it spits out the diagnostics.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/658814710/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/658898010","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/3076#issuecomment-658898010","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3076","id":658898010,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1ODg5ODAxMA==","user":{"login":"mrajah-twttr","id":66497287,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NDk3Mjg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66497287?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrajah-twttr","html_url":"https://github.com/mrajah-twttr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrajah-twttr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrajah-twttr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrajah-twttr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrajah-twttr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrajah-twttr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrajah-twttr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrajah-twttr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrajah-twttr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrajah-twttr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-15T17:24:52Z","updated_at":"2020-07-15T17:26:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"this looks very cool.thanks for taking the time to redo this. \r\n\r\ni got a chance to play around with the new experience and noticed a couple of issues\r\n1. if you search by service name and then you try to edit the box and remove all the content (quick way to clear the service name you entered) the \"servicename\" option is not present any more in suggested options (i see spanName and other options which are assuming service name is present)? does it make sense to keep search criteria and search text in separate text boxes instead of a single text box with servicename=<abcdservice>? i think this is the same issue jorgheymans noted\r\n2. does it make sense to not have the user click on the + on load and open up with  the  the first search box ready to be filled.\r\n3. i believe this is an issue even in existing UI but when you start typing the service name the characters dont show up right away until the lookahead is returned making it feel like a hang at times. since we are in the same code base would be great if we can fix it?\r\n\r\noverall i see this as a nice way forward, excited to push it to our customers when it lands.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/658898010/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/661223474","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3084#issuecomment-661223474","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3084","id":661223474,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2MTIyMzQ3NA==","user":{"login":"jfosback","id":13388924,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzg4OTI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13388924?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfosback","html_url":"https://github.com/jfosback","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfosback/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfosback/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfosback/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfosback/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfosback/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfosback/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfosback/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfosback/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfosback/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-20T17:31:44Z","updated_at":"2020-07-20T17:31:44Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This appears to be resolved in 2.21.5.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/661223474/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/662751899","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2163#issuecomment-662751899","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2163","id":662751899,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2Mjc1MTg5OQ==","user":{"login":"drolando","id":3317638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTc2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3317638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drolando","html_url":"https://github.com/drolando","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drolando/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drolando/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drolando/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drolando/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drolando/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drolando/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drolando/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drolando/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drolando/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-22T23:44:06Z","updated_at":"2020-07-22T23:44:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@michaelsembwever hey!
