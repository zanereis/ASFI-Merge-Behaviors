do you think about naming conventions consistent between the processors that do this \"incremental commit\"? I added this capability to QueryDatabaseTable under [NIFI-4836](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-4836), and not to say we have to use my namings, but as it is in product it might be better to have the properties and such be named and documented consistently. For example, QDT has a single property that takes a zero value to indicate that it should wait until all results are processed before sending the files downstream. What are your thoughts?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/401890106/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/401912014","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2802#issuecomment-401912014","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2802","id":401912014,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMTkxMjAxNA==","user":{"login":"alopresto","id":798465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODQ2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/798465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto","html_url":"https://github.com/alopresto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-02T19:40:59Z","updated_at":"2018-07-02T19:40:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @MikeThomsen, I'm going to politely ask that you revert the commit and re-open this PR and Jira. I commented earlier that I would review this and was busy with the 1.7.0 release process and some other security issues. \r\n\r\n1. I opened this Jira because I had a specific security-related need for this processor. @ottobackwards took the initiative to work on this, which I appreciate, but I did not have a chance to review this before you merged it. \r\n1. This is security-related content which (like all feature work) the community will need to support moving forward. This needs to be carefully reviewed. \r\n1. There is no rush to merge this; a release was just created, which means there will likely not be a new release for some time. I even checked with Otto to ensure that he did not have a pressing need for this.

I've tried running it and it does indeed address the issue called out in the JIRA. Previously, the infinite loop occurred when trying to configure the services in question. With the PR in place, I can now configure the services to build the reference cycle. However, if I try to enable them I encountered a different infinite loop here:\r\n\r\nat org.apache.nifi.controller.service.StandardControllerServiceReference.findRecursiveReferences(StandardControllerServiceReference.java:125)\r\n\r\nI also seem to recall that previously the framework would identify when a reference cycle was detected and it would set that flag in the `ControllerServiceReferencingComponentDTO`. I noticed in the UI after establishing the reference cycle, the framework did not appear to detect it. This may or may not be related to the infinite loop referenced above. I do not believe this infinite loop is a result of this PR, but it's something we should probably address now as well.\r\n\r\nIn my scenario service A did not reference any other service, service B referenced service A and C, and service C referenced service B. In your testing, did you happen to hit the same loop I did when trying to enable them?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/403063176/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/403069749","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2847#issuecomment-403069749","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2847","id":403069749,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMzA2OTc0OQ==","user":{"login":"JonathanKessler","id":19499288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDk5Mjg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19499288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonathanKessler","html_url":"https://github.com/JonathanKessler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonathanKessler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonathanKessler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonathanKessler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonathanKessler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonathanKessler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonathanKessler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonathanKessler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonathanKessler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonathanKessler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-06T15:37:21Z","updated_at":"2018-07-06T15:37:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mcgilman Did you experience this behavior on the graph or in a unit test?
