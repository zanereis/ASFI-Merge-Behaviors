@jhsenjaliya \r\n\r\nYou could of course implement this using a bash command. But in a production environment the spark-submit process will be light weight as the actual Spark driver is running on the YARN cluster inside of a container (when using `yarn-cluster`, which is most common). So it would not make sense to remotely execute the process on another machine.\r\n\r\nThe spark-submit command has been stable for a while. Many of the fine grained configuration options are submitted using the conf dict, if you like.\r\n\r\nDoes this answer your question, or am I missing something?\r\n\r\nCheers","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/276500454/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/276509348","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2037#issuecomment-276509348","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2037","id":276509348,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NjUwOTM0OA==","user":{"login":"criccomini","id":167569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzU2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/167569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini","html_url":"https://github.com/criccomini","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-31T22:10:32Z","updated_at":"2017-01-31T22:10:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM but I think there's duplicate code for the GCS stuff--would prefer just using the gcs_hook.py stuff.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/276509348/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/276516430","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2037#issuecomment-276516430","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2037","id":276516430,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NjUxNjQzMA==","user":{"login":"fenglu-db","id":24922485,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTIyNDg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24922485?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenglu-db","html_url":"https://github.com/fenglu-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenglu-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenglu-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenglu-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenglu-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenglu-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenglu-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenglu-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenglu-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenglu-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-31T22:39:14Z","updated_at":"2017-01-31T22:39:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@criccomini could you elaborate a bit more?

spark command based on parameters is useful functionality to get with this wrapper, it can execute with existing operator so that its easy to maintain afterwards due to reused code.\r\nanyway, thats my 2 cents, I am not committer, so let see what others has to say in this. Thanks for explaining though.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/276563394/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/276563668","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2026#issuecomment-276563668","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2026","id":276563668,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NjU2MzY2OA==","user":{"login":"jhsenjaliya","id":5017402,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMTc0MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5017402?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhsenjaliya","html_url":"https://github.com/jhsenjaliya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhsenjaliya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhsenjaliya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhsenjaliya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhsenjaliya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhsenjaliya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhsenjaliya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhsenjaliya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhsenjaliya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhsenjaliya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-01T03:29:37Z","updated_at":"2017-02-01T03:29:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@artwr, @bolkedebruin Please take a look. it uses temp file now.\r\n@boristyukin please check the added regex matching output functionality","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/276563668/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/276616587","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2042#issuecomment-276616587","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2042","id":276616587,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NjYxNjU4Nw==","user":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-01T09:56:08Z","updated_at":"2017-02-01T09:56:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I value your input. This is some first contribution to Airflow beside a bugfix. So it could be that I'm missing something. How would you change the implementation?\r\n\r\nI mostly based it on the other hooks which are already in there. For example, the sqoop and piq hooks are also using the subprocesses.\r\n\r\nFor maintainability I am thinking to merge the spark-sql and spark-submit by putting the shared configuration into an abstract class.
