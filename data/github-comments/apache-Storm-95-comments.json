hub (and Kafka) play well into event source architectures as event ingest point for later Storm processing to downstream stateful consumers.\n\nAdvanced event stream processing, such as replaying parts of a stream, requires that the downstream consumers can synchronise different \"stream runs\" to their stateful view, which itself can be seen as an aggregation of all previous events. To set up the right context for re-processing the stream in a deterministic way, they need to sync their view with the incoming old data. To be able to do this, they need knowledge of the event sequenceNumber and partition.\n\nFor example, if you have a bolt that calculates total_order_amount for a stream of orders, and emits order tuples with the total_order_amount calculated for all previous orders, replaying an order event should not change total_order_amount. I.e. orders with a higher sequenceNumber than the order being processed should not be included in total_order_amount.\n\nThis synchronisation can be achieved if the bolt has access to the parition and sequenceNumber from eventHub.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/124075611/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612582657","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4797#issuecomment-2612582657","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4797","id":2612582657,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI1ODI2NTc=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-23T12:46:41Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T13:52:53Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a

My solution will have a \"parallelism constraint\", which does not seem bad, as is seems many users already behave this way. But I realize there will be others who don't like this constraint. To that end, I will attempt to create a layer whereby one can plug in different AutoScaleManagers (I'm going to propose a name like \"AutoScaleManager\", as Threshold Monitor Daemon seems to imply implementations). If we do it right, my implementation can coexist with UIUC's implementation, and others. I wish them well in their solution, my motivation is that I'm going to be responsible for 100's of independent Topologies, and without something like this it will be an operational nightmare. </p>\n\n<p>I envision the AutoScaleManager will be associated with the Topology when it is submitted to Nimbus. Could be part of the core Storm code base, or a custom user class.</p>\n\n<p>There will be one (or more) strategically placed calls from the Topology management code during the management lifecycle, such as during deployment/delivery of code to Workers, to modify/enhance the topology. It will be in this phase that saved history or initial defaults will be applied to the Topology, altering parallelism, workers, ackers, queue sizes etc... This call will be a \"black box\" to core Storm code. The \"saved history\" will be the sole responsibility of the AutoScaleManager.</p>\n\n<p>Then the AutoScaleManager must run as a daemon somewhere. I'm going to propose that it run as a Thread inside Nimbus. This will make management of the daemon easy for simple use cases. And when Nimbus solves the HA/failover issues, the AutoScaleManager take advantage of that solution as well. Whenever Nimbus is watching over a Topology, the AutoScaleManager for that Topology is running. We will need various lifecycle methods such as start and stop that Nimbus will call at the correct times.</p>\n\n<p>When the AutoScaleManager needs to make changes, all of the Nimbus APIs are available. It could do whatever runtime changes are allowed, like alter parallelism. For large changes it will simply stop then start the Topology, the \"enhance\" callback will perform the changes. Furthermore, if it is making runtime changes, it will need to remember them so when code changes happen, they are used as the initial defaults for that code roll.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612515853/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/124560610","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/644#issuecomment-124560610","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/644","id":124560610,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNDU2MDYxMA==","user":{"login":"ptgoetz","id":260896,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDg5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/260896?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz","html_url":"https://github.com/ptgoetz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-24T15:35:43Z","updated_at":"2015-07-24T15:35:43Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@arunmahadevan Quick question (I haven't done a full review yet): Is there a way to make this work for Timed rotation policies?

tenable, as some components are just responsible for writing some negligible results and thus shouldn't be spread over the cluster.  But apart from that, I think the most tricky part is how would you identify the most bottlenecked component, and how to tackle this imbalance problem. The bottleneck could be either with spout whose instances are not powerful enough (so that some of the bolts are actually starving) or some bolts lying in the critical path that do not have enough parallelism hints. Since the bottleneck is absolutely application dependent, I believe a \"good rule of thumb\" is still needed in an universal auto-scaling system and maybe you need to address that clearly in your approach.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612515858/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/124851746","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/643#issuecomment-124851746","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/643","id":124851746,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNDg1MTc0Ng==","user":{"login":"vesense","id":6711230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MTEyMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6711230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense","html_url":"https://github.com/vesense","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-25T14:43:22Z","updated_at":"2015-07-25T14:43:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thx.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/124851746/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612515863","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4435#issuecomment-2612515863","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4435","id":2612515863,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI1MTU4NjM=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-25T15:18:03Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T13:19:54Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=jon.weygandt\">jon.weygandt</a>:</i>\n<p>I have yet to work with a use case like that, although one of my colleagues pointed this out. I am really interested in how Nimbus actually converts bolts/parallelism/workers into a physical executable layout. This has always fascinated me, as how does one take the given input and create something that is stable and manageable. I have yet to look at the code for this, but if it is very predictable and what one wants: the \"singleton bolts\" will need to be tagged in a method the AutoScaleManager recognizes and the scaling algorithm will use that tagging. If the topology allocation is not what one wants, but it is somewhat \"modular\", perhaps the AutoScaleManager could have a computePhysicalTopology method, so that part of the layout is under the control of the auto-scale system.</p>\n\n<p>Although we did go into more detail on what bolts classify as \"singleton bolts\". One that does: an accumulator of some distributed operation, that is accumulating partial results into a final result. Thus if you partitioned it you would not get the results you want. These must be \"singleton bolts\". One that does not: an email out bolt. Yes it is trivial, the system will work fine with only one. But logically the system will work fine with one per worker as well. Some might think that's wasteful, but for email, not really. You have one more thread, but it is doing X/workers amount of work. In fact this may be more efficient, as you won't have to do (de)serialization and IPC to the singleton. Now if it is a database output bolt, and connections to the DB are limited, a tradeoff. </p>\n\n<p>We will support both scenarios, so the Storm developer will have a choice.</p>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612515863/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612515867","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4435#issuecomment-2612515867","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4435","id":2612515867,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI1MTU4Njc=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-25T15:40:31Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T13:19:54Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=jon.weygandt\">jon.weygandt</a>:</i>\n<p>How to detect bottlenecks: This is tricky to predict and we won't in a single iteration, and UIUC did about 16 (+/-) iterations in their sample runs. Remember this may not work for everything, which is why this is designed to be a \"plugin\", so others can improve on this or do things differently.</p>\n\n<p>One input will be the target tps for each spout. We have daily/weekly/seasonal variations, and the owner of the topology should have some idea of the target rates. That will mean that during the busy time (also most important time) the system is not trying to rebalance, as rebalances may produce s small glitch in the flow. FWIW - I'm not trying to solve a totally elastic min by min or hr by hr flex problem. The problem I'm working on is to ease the management of a topology over the entire lifetime: the initial deployment and adjustment of numbers; as well as longer term, code roll to code roll, gradual increase in load; the changes for the estimated increase for seasonal traffic; as well as some automated handling and/or alerting when there are unexpected changes.</p>\n\n<p>Algorithm proposal: </p>\n\n<p>Step 1: So if the spout is pegged at 100% capacity, and we know the current tps, and target tps, we can estimate the number of instances. If the spout is not, likely one of the downstream bolts is. We do the same estimate.  </p>\n\n<p>Step 2: Then the next part is tricker, but follow the topology and you can get a ratio of the weighted average input of the spouts tps with respect to each bolts tps, and each bolts capacity. And knowing the target spouts capacity, do the math and get an estimate. As the bottleneck moves from spout to the last bolt, this estimate will get better and better for the bolts further up stream.</p>\n\n<p>Add in some hysteresis to prevent needless cycling.</p>\n\n<p>I believe this will converge for many system in a few cycles. And it may quite likely be bounded by the length/depth of the topology.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612515867/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/124856128","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/644#issuecomment-124856128","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/644","id":124856128,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNDg1NjEyOA==","user":{"login":"harshach","id":38649,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NjQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38649?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach","html_url":"https://github.com/harshach","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-25T15:55:55Z","updated_at":"2015-07-25T15:55:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ptgoetz @arunmahadevan  can we not make this as a default behaviour instead make this as option.
