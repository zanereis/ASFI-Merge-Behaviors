However, I'm afraid I will need to reject this PR as of its current state.\r\n\r\nThe main issue is that we can't just move those public user-facing classes. We either have to deprecate them and have a more general packaging path for them so that they can be shared across batch / stream ES connectors, or that we simply duplicate them for batch.\r\n\r\nAs for the base class logic, this PR needs refactoring so that common logic between the batch and stream is shared, instead of almost the exact same code copied between the two.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? Please let me know if you would like to continue on working on this :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/312186865/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/312191168","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3891#issuecomment-312191168","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3891","id":312191168,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMjE5MTE2OA==","user":{"login":"tzulitai","id":5284370,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODQzNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5284370?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai","html_url":"https://github.com/tzulitai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-30T06:58:59Z","updated_at":"2017-06-30T06:58:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This looks good! +1, merging ...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/312191168/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/312191239","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3891#issuecomment-312191239","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3891","id":312191239,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMjE5MTIzOQ==","user":{"login":"tzulitai","id":5284370,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODQzNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5284370?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai","html_url":"https://github.com/tzulitai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-30T06:59:27Z","updated_at":"2017-06-30T06:59:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"One question: I'm curious how the scan for tests that use HDFS was searched?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/312191239/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/312193016","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3776#issuecomment-312193016","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3776","id":312193016,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMjE5MzAxNg==","user":{"login":"tzulitai","id":5284370,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODQzNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5284370?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai","html_url":"https://github.com/tzulitai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-30T07:10:11Z","updated_at":"2017-06-30T07:10:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Rucongzhang ok, understood.

Before doing work on these parts I would suggest to start a `[DISCUSS]` thread on the dev mailing list to 1) describe your motivation for changing these parts, 2) see what other people have already thought about this, and 3) to coordinate changes with other people working on this.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry for the inconvenience this causes you because you already started working on code. \r\n\r\nI'm aware of at least @StefanRRichter, @StephanEwen and me as having spend some cycles thinking about changes in these parts.\r\n\r\nFor example, we would definitely need to discuss what constitutes \"operator config\", \"task config\" and general \"stream config\" and how we want to shield the different components from each other and make them more modular.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/312585646/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/312601164","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4246#issuecomment-312601164","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4246","id":312601164,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMjYwMTE2NA==","user":{"login":"StefanRRichter","id":2128543,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjg1NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2128543?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter","html_url":"https://github.com/StefanRRichter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-03T09:49:10Z","updated_at":"2017-07-03T09:49:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"CC

We should have a separate parameters to specify watermark adjustments and early firings.\r\n\r\nI propose the following:\r\n\r\n1. We add a parameter `lateDataTimeOffset` which adjusts the watermarks at the source (actually at all sources of a query) by injecting a custom operator. The parameter can be positive or negative and adjusts the watermarks. I think the name is good because the watermarks control the lateness of records. Also, Table API / SQL users should not need to know about the concept of watermarks. **This is done as part of this issue / PR.**\r\n\r\n2. We add a parameter `earlyResultTimeOffset` which defines the time when the first early result (e.g., of a windowed aggregate) is computed. The parameter should be negative, i.e., a value of `-30.mins` results in early results which start 30 minute before the watermark reaches the end of a window. \r\n\r\n3. The same `updateRate` parameter as in [FLINK-6649](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-6649) / PR #4157 is used to control how often early results are updated. I don't think we need a special parameters for early result or late data updates.\r\n\r\n**2. and 3. are addressed in a separate issue.**\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/312635486/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/312637201","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4213#issuecomment-312637201","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4213","id":312637201,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMjYzNzIwMQ==","user":{"login":"StefanRRichter","id":2128543,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjg1NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2128543?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter","html_url":"https://github.com/StefanRRichter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-03T12:50:25Z","updated_at":"2017-07-03T12:50:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I

general, it is a good idea to clean that up a bit. That code needed some refactoring.\r\n\r\nAs @aljoscha pointed out, that is an intricate part, so we need to review that carefully. To be able to review that, we need a good description of what the refactoring did. Trying to understand that from the code alone will take a lot of time and most likely slow down the merging of this by a lot.\r\n\r\nI would suggest to write\r\n  - what exactly was addressed\r\n  - what is the new design\r\n  - does it change behavior, or is it only code abstraction internally\r\n\r\n\r\nAs another point: I just took a quick look at the `OperatorConfig`. I think I would be nice to move away from the model of having a Map of \"configKey\" to values, but just to make this a serializable class with the respective fields. That would be simpler to understand and maintain.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/312703916/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/312713044","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4233#issuecomment-312713044","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4233","id":312713044,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMjcxMzA0NA==","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-03T18:49:13Z","updated_at":"2017-07-03T18:49:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've moved a few more modules into the misc. group:\r\n* flink-metrics\r\n* flink-java8\r\n* flink-streaming-contrib\r\n* flink-scala-shell\r\n\r\nFor the core group we now only compile modules that the core modules actually depend on, reducing the core build time to 30 minutes: https://travis-ci.org/zentol/flink/builds/249710980","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/312713044/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/312720199","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4015#issuecomment-312720199","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4015","id":312720199,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMjcyMDE5OQ==","user":{"login":"vidhu5269","id":9129614,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMjk2MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9129614?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidhu5269","html_url":"https://github.com/vidhu5269","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidhu5269/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidhu5269/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidhu5269/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidhu5269/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidhu5269/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidhu5269/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidhu5269/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidhu5269/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidhu5269/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-03T19:36:26Z","updated_at":"2017-07-03T19:36:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @tzulitai \r\n\r\nApologies for such a long delay. It took me quite a while to come back to this.\r\n\r\nI ran the updated connector on the cluster and didn't see any dependency conflicts. The job using it was reading from a gzipped avro topic and producing into two different topics: a text and an avro topic. Both the consumption and production worked as expected.\r\n\r\nIt was done on a standalone cluster with 2 workers and 1 master with 8 slots/worker. The job was using 10 slots and was running on the both the workers. Each worker had 8 vCPUs and 8 GB of RAM. \r\n\r\nWith this job, I also verified that there wasn't any memory leak with the `kafka-clients` version change.\r\n\r\nFollowing is the diff between the master and version change commit from `mvn dependency:tree`:\r\n```\r\n20c20\r\n< [INFO] +- org.apache.kafka:kafka-clients:jar:0.10.0.1:compile\r\n---\r\n> [INFO] +- org.apache.kafka:kafka-clients:jar:0.10.2.0:compile\r\n27,28c27,28\r\n< [INFO] +- org.apache.kafka:kafka_2.11:jar:0.10.0.1:test\r\n< [INFO] |  +- com.101tec:zkclient:jar:0.8:test\r\n---\r\n> [INFO] +- org.apache.kafka:kafka_2.11:jar:0.10.2.0:test\r\n> [INFO] |  +- net.sf.jopt-simple:jopt-simple:jar:5.0.3:test\r\n31,35c31,33\r\n< [INFO] |  +- org.scala-lang.modules:scala-parser-combinators_2.11:jar:1.0.4:test\r\n< [INFO] |  +- net.sf.jopt-simple:jopt-simple:jar:4.9:test\r\n< [INFO] |  \\- org.apache.zookeeper:zookeeper:jar:3.4.6:provided\r\n< [INFO] |     +- jline:jline:jar:0.9.94:provided\r\n< [INFO] |     \\- io.netty:netty:jar:3.7.0.Final:provided\r\n---\r\n> [INFO] |  +- com.101tec:zkclient:jar:0.10:test\r\n> [INFO] |  +- org.apache.zookeeper:zookeeper:jar:3.4.6:provided\r\n> [INFO] |  \\- org.scala-lang.modules:scala-parser-combinators_2.11:jar:1.0.4:test\r\n70a69\r\n> [INFO] |  |  +- io.netty:netty:jar:3.8.0.Final:provided\r\n```\r\nFrom what we can see here, apart from the new kafka-clients library, there are a few changes coming from its tests-jar as well.\r\n1. The tests-jar has new version of `net.sf.jopt-simple:jopt-simple` and `com.101tec:zkclient:jar:0.10` in `test` scope. \r\n2. `jline:jline` is not there in the new version.\r\n3. `3.8.0-Final` of `io.netty:netty` is being pulled in (from `flakka-remote`) instead of `3.7.0-Final`. \r\n\r\nSince the job and the unit tests worked as expected, I am assuming that these dependency changes are not breaking anything. Do tell me if I am missing something here.\r\n\r\nAlthough, these are not new dependencies but I still verified that `zkclient` and `netty` both have ASL 2.0 whereas, jopt-simple has `MIT` which is also compatible with ASL 2.0. So, we should be good as far as licensing goes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/312720199/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/312720997","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4015#issuecomment-312720997","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4015","id":312720997,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMjcyMDk5Nw==","user":{"login":"vidhu5269","id":9129614,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMjk2MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9129614?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidhu5269","html_url":"https://github.com/vidhu5269","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidhu5269/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidhu5269/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidhu5269/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidhu5269/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidhu5269/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidhu5269/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidhu5269/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidhu5269/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidhu5269/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-03T19:41:45Z","updated_at":"2017-07-03T19:41:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I also see that a few of the continuous-integration builds have failed.
