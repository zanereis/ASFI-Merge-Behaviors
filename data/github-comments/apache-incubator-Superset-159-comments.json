It shows up in the frontend as \"filter\" but doesn't show up in the queryobj or eventual query.\r\n\r\nWe tried this alternative, to use the new **filter context**, but it says filter is not defined.\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT country, sum(population) as population \r\nFROM \r\ntbl\r\nWHERE 0=0\r\n{% if  filter[0].get('val')[0] %}\r\n    AND continent = '{{  filter[0].get('val')[0] }}'\r\n{% endif %}\r\nGROUP BY 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat however works is if we have a column by the same name as the filter, e.g. a filter called country with the same variable name works dynamically - but as a predicate on the super query, and not on the actual query in itself.\r\n\r\nDoes this make it clearer? Thanks for offering to
