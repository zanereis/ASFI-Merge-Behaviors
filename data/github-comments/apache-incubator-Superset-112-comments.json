A few other notes:\r\n* loading different dimensions could be parallelized on the backend to make things faster\r\n* cascading filters (where the list of values is based on a previously selected filter) are great for hierarchies (think: continent->country-> city). Currently it's doable only by having multiple FilterBox slices where one refreshes based on the other, but not the other way around (you can make the first filterbox immune to filtering). It's pretty common for BI tools to know about hierarchies and we could add support for that in our semantic layer and cascade things accordingly based on that.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/350026664/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/350027478","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/4025#issuecomment-350027478","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/4025","id":350027478,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MDAyNzQ3OA==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-07T16:52:06Z","updated_at":"2017-12-07T16:52:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Just create 2 different roles.

@xeijin @nam147 I updated my branch to get to a more stable state. Now when you click on the export to SVG button in the slice view, it'll redirect you to the image as SVG. Take a look at this commit if you want to see the changes: https://github.com/SalehHindi/superset/commit/b7e39c9a5e16c0c1e2f8cc7653898fd68d0899c9\r\n\r\nNote that the redirect doesn't work in Chrome but it doesn't matter because I think the idea will be to use Selenium to go to the slice view page, export and download the SVG, and then serve it to the user when the user visits, say, `/superset/export_slice/<slice_id>`. That way the user can have more programmatic control over what they export. I'll be working on this after work. I've used selenium before so this shouldn't be hard.\r\n\r\nAs you pointed out @nam147 the styles that come from external style sheets aren't being exported properly because the code relies on a hacky way to export rendered HTML to SVG [as described in this post](http://robert.ocallahan.org/2011/11/drawing-dom-content-to-canvas.html). After getting selenium to serve the funky looking SVG I'd like to properly pull in the styles which will involve traversing all the nodes in `visualization.html()`, grabbing the styles, and then appending them to each node as inline styles so they get exported to the canvas. The styling work is parallelizable to the selenium work because you can just click the Export to SVG button in Firefox to see if it works.\r\n\r\nAnd then finally there is the issue of tests. I'm still thinking through how to test this properly once the feature is finished. I'm open to any suggestions : )","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/350791432/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/350874730","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/2220#issuecomment-350874730","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/2220","id":350874730,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MDg3NDczMA==","user":{"login":"bryceschober","id":918614,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxODYxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/918614?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryceschober","html_url":"https://github.com/bryceschober","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryceschober/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryceschober/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryceschober/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryceschober/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryceschober/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryceschober/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryceschober/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryceschober/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryceschober/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-11T22:09:34Z","updated_at":"2017-12-11T22:09:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@mistercrunch It has fallen behind again...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/350874730/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/350898369","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/3604#issuecomment-350898369","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/3604","id":350898369,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MDg5ODM2OQ==","user":{"login":"ahsanshah","id":14385814,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0Mzg1ODE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14385814?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahsanshah","html_url":"https://github.com/ahsanshah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahsanshah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahsanshah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahsanshah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahsanshah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahsanshah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahsanshah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahsanshah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahsanshah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahsanshah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-11T23:57:05Z","updated_at":"2017-12-11T23:57:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Same here.
