There are three points to note at this stage by following the code\r\n-  First, before sending data, you need to manually create a transaction coordinator to control the one to many relationship between PID and transcationId. To this end, you need to ensure that the consumption progress of offset is notified to the tc in a timely manner and that the messages of submitted but unsettled transactions will not be deleted by mistake during the simultaneous process of the scheduled deletion task\r\n- Whether it is necessary to judge the progress of the current offset and the global PID visible transaction offset in PullLiteProducer in order to enable PID ->transactionid to achieve cross partition transaction consistency\r\n- When downstream consumers consume, they need to ensure that messages marked as transactionId in the upstream market are perceived by downstream consumers","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1246367514/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1246559335","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/5055#issuecomment-1246559335","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/5055","id":1246559335,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl85KTPxn","user":{"login":"nowinkeyy","id":72536832,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTM2ODMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72536832?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nowinkeyy","html_url":"https://github.com/nowinkeyy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nowinkeyy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nowinkeyy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nowinkeyy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nowinkeyy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nowinkeyy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nowinkeyy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nowinkeyy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nowinkeyy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nowinkeyy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-14T10:25:00Z","updated_at":"2022-09-14T11:26:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> In fact, to solve the problem of automatic creation (autoCreateTopicEnable) from RocketMQ 4.3.0, Rocketmq provides a topicKey to specify the default topic, as shown in the following code:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> DefaultMQProducer producer = new DefaultMQProducer(\"please_rename_unidcque_group_name\");\r\n> //Set the key value of automatic topic creation\r\n> producer.setCreateTopicKey(\"AUTO_CREATE_TOPIC_KEY\");\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> After the instance information of namesrv is registered, you can solve the above problem by setting the topicKey\r\n\r\n```\r\nprivate String createTopicKey = TopicValidator.AUTO_CREATE_TOPIC_KEY_TOPIC;\r\npublic static final String AUTO_CREATE_TOPIC_KEY_TOPIC = \"TBW102\";\r\n```\r\nYour idea seems to be just to change the TBW102 topic something else.
