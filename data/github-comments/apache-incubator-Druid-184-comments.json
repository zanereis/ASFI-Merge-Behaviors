I don't think the behavior of your http-based coordination/monitoring (including `HttpRemoteTaskRunner` and `HttpServerInventoryView`) is same with the current ZK-based stuffs. In the current implementation, every information is updated whenever a ZK event occurs which is watched by a short small polling. In this implementation, users can expect that Druid will do something whenever it catches the events immediately. \r\n\r\nHowever, in the new HTTP-based stuffs, they basically work based on long polling. This means that every individual event cannot be seen immediately when they occur. Instead, multiple events can be seen in bulk per polling period. This can also increase the cpu usage of coordinators/brokers/overlords while polling a lot of segments/tasks.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying which one is faster/slower or even better/worse.

Both `HttpServerInventoryView` and `HttpRemoteTaskRunner` use the same http long polling mechanism . Servers are discovered via `DruidNodeDiscoveryProvider` abstract class (current implementation is curator/zk based) and then `HTTP long polling` based API is used to keep the state in sync in realtime.\r\nYou pointed to the correct code that is sending the HTTP request. However, that HTTP request is based on the principles of \"long polling\" (also described in https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ARCH/pages/41713738/HTTP+Long-Polling ) which allows keeping the state synced e.g. updating worker/task status etc updated in realtime.\r\n\r\nNow that is also main difference between `RemoteTaskRunner` and `HttpRemoteTaskRunner` . `RemoteTaskRunner` is hard coded to use zookeeper for all the interactions wherease `HttpRemoteTaskRunner` discovers MMs via an abstract interface that can be implemented with any mechanism (eventually there would be non-zookeeper impls of `DruidNodeDiscoveryProvider` ) and all interaction with MMs are done via HTTP requests.\r\nAside from that some minor design differences are in terms of better handling assigning multiple tasks in parallel to different MMs and also handling many corner cases related to status updates received from MMs .\r\nalso read the thread at https://groups.google.com/d/msg/druid-development/eIWDPfhpM_U/AzMRxSQGAgAJ to learn some of the motivation and overall picture for this work.\r\n\r\nhope that helps.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/381379953/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/381495499","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/2384#issuecomment-381495499","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2384","id":381495499,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MTQ5NTQ5OQ==","user":{"login":"xianyinxin","id":15028683,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDI4Njgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15028683?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xianyinxin","html_url":"https://github.com/xianyinxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xianyinxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xianyinxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xianyinxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xianyinxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xianyinxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xianyinxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xianyinxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xianyinxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xianyinxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-16T06:43:13Z","updated_at":"2018-04-16T06:43:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for your hint @michaelschiff , will look into that :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/381495499/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/381563535","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/5629#issuecomment-381563535","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/5629","id":381563535,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MTU2MzUzNQ==","user":{"login":"sixtus","id":91857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxODU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sixtus","html_url":"https://github.com/sixtus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sixtus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sixtus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sixtus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sixtus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sixtus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sixtus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sixtus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sixtus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sixtus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-16T11:09:09Z","updated_at":"2018-04-16T11:09:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"status update: we need to restart our historicals every ~12h atm.

Data nodes should keep state changes in their queues or somewhere until the poller comes back to normal and sends requests. The only difference is data nodes don't have to worry about retrying in polling, but the poller has to consider retrying when some data nodes are not available. If it ignores failing to receive responses from some data nodes and hope everything goes well in the next poll, some events might not be seen immediately which increases system latency.\r\n\r\nPolling might be bug-less than pushing even though I don't necessarily agree with that. But, even if it's true, polling inherently has some limitations when compared to pushing like less scalability, higher latency, higher network bandwidth usage, and so on.

It might be a good solution for some applications which don't need high scalability and low latency. \r\n\r\nHowever, regarding at least latency, I think we need to lower latencies.

There would be multiple such corner cases where a MM is doing something that does not match up to what it should be doing from `HttpRemoteTaskRunner` point of view.\r\nIn general, when MMs are being synced then that MMs specific WorkerHolder's list of task gets updated first and then the global list maintained by `HttpRemoteTaskRunner` and there could be a small lag before it starts to show up in global list but they would converge.\r\n\r\n ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/382120736/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/382121119","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/5658#issuecomment-382121119","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/5658","id":382121119,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MjEyMTExOQ==","user":{"login":"himanshug","id":246308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjMwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug","html_url":"https://github.com/himanshug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-17T19:55:03Z","updated_at":"2018-04-17T19:55:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jihoonson glad to see you're experimenting with Http based stuff .
