Currently, zipkin trace ids are\nlogged as fixed 16 lowerhex in json.\n\nWhen you copy paste this id into something with full text search, it comes\nback. When we widen that to 128bit, and start encoding, we might want to\nstill encode ids with high bits unset as 16 chars as opposed to padding to\n32.\n\nEx. Instead of one with traceId '12ab3..4' and an upgraded one with traceId\n'0000...12ab..34' use 16char lowerhex encoding. That way, those who\ncurrently do full text search on zipkin ids are likely to copy/paste a\nvalue that works even in a system not fully upgraded.\n\nIf we did this, the cool part is that the edge (originator of a trace aka\nthe tracer that makes a root trace) makes the final decision on whether or\nnot 128bit ids are supported. Ex if it only sends 64bits of id, the system\nwill work on the brown field. When ready, that edge tracer flips a switch\nand now 128bit ids are used.\n\nThoughts?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/245463522/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/245465227","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1262#issuecomment-245465227","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1262","id":245465227,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NTQ2NTIyNw==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-08T01:04:01Z","updated_at":"2016-09-08T01:04:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Sorry one more thing I should have said in the beginning.. the audience of\nthis change!\n\nKeep in mind that while most who want to integrate with Zipkin use B3\npropagation, not everyone does.

It made me think! long thoughts about the thing in general\n\n### Client-tracing in C\\* is not yet transparent\n\nRegardless of how we coordinate, we need to coordinate. Ex you introduce a special binary annotation, before we also had to do work to control names (especially as datastax nixed the ability to have client-side metadata). I needed to use a proxy to make it drop-in (without collaboration code from the caller). This is a similar problem in Kafka, except easier in Cassandra as at least there's a server-hook.\n\n### I should have written tests on server tracing\n\nA lot of things had to happen before the storage layer could be decoupled from the trace layer explicitly, with short, low-cardinality span names and without async bugs. It took more than a couple days to get this working. When thinking about tests, I realized it would likely take a few days to create them (as it needs to read back and forth to figure out things). I special-cased with flags, smaller entry scope instead, and zero coordination instead of investing more time to make this a real tracer. If I wrote tests, we'd know that this is a drop-in or not. Now, we don't.. at least not without eye-balling spans and running manually.\n\n### End notes\n\nRegardless of which approach is used, it is probably mutually obvious that the code involved is probably better off as a library, particularly when it aims to act generically (ex work on any Statement). If such a library could drive changes in the datastax api to make it more transparent, far more than self-tracing would benefit.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/246232433/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/246234015","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/1289#issuecomment-246234015","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1289","id":246234015,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NjIzNDAxNQ==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-12T03:11:18Z","updated_at":"2016-09-12T03:11:24Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I'd really like to not use defensive list add, and instead go back to the set approach to ensure unique keys. it is easier to not have to think about pairing if-add, and instead just assert a set add.\n\nWRT the change itself.. honestly, I'm pleasantly surprised it works!
