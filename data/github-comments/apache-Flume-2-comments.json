@satiatcloudera. \r\n\r\n2) Totally agree. I had a version with this and somehow it got reverted.\r\n3) process() from a sink calls channel.take() until the batch size. If there is no event we break out of the loop and then commit the transaction. See https://github.com/apache/flume/blob/trunk/flume-ng-sinks/flume-hdfs-sink/src/main/java/org/apache/flume/sink/hdfs/HDFSEventSink.java#L362. \r\n\r\nThe logic here is a little complicated, and it's always worth another look. We could probably catch the Exceptions that the Kafka Consumer could throw during commitSync CommitFailedException and Wakeup exception. Is it ok if we address this logic in another jira? \r\n\r\n4) I agree, but I'd like to separate that change. \r\n\r\n5) We are just clearing our internal tracking Map. This essentially prevents committing previously committed offsets. In a topic with a large number of partitions, this can be problematic. \r\n\r\nAll of this is kind of hard to follow. I think the unit-tests are kind of tricky to understand, and the logic could be clearer. \r\n\r\nThe intent of this patch is to address a situation where the Channel can get totally stuck. Happy to take another pass at refactoring the channel.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/issues/comments/262832350/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/issues/comments/262988365","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/logging-flume/pull/93#issuecomment-262988365","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/issues/93","id":262988365,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2Mjk4ODM2NQ==","user":{"login":"simonati","id":20295893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMjk1ODkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20295893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonati","html_url":"https://github.com/simonati","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonati/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonati/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonati/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonati/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonati/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonati/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonati/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonati/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonati/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-25T16:09:50Z","updated_at":"2016-11-25T16:09:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I think the reset configuration for kafkachannel is kind of internal.

Yes, one of the side effects of the wrapping is that `BucketWriter` doesn't close the file if an `IOException` is thrown because it doesn't expect the exception to be wrapped in `SecurityException`. But it's just one example, same applies to the `BucketWriter.doFlush()` method, which is transitively called from `HDFSEventSink.process()` which also handles `IOException`s differently than other exceptions. I agree that this test is a bit low-level but I think writing unit test for one of the actual effects of the wrapping wouldn't really test this change.\r\nMy intent with the test was that the implementations (`SimpleAuthenticator` and `KerberosAuthenticator` - which delegates the call to `UGIExecutor`) don't wrap the exception, meaning they rethrow it as-is or a new one with the same type (or subclass). This is the contract we broke with the wrapping in the `UGIExecutor.execute()`. (I might have used other approaches to test, e.g. checking that the very same exception instance is thrown, that's true.)\r\n\r\nI updated the Jira ticket to make the intent behind this change more clear.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/issues/comments/276421789/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/issues/comments/276439030","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/logging-flume/pull/106#issuecomment-276439030","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/issues/106","id":276439030,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NjQzOTAzMA==","user":{"login":"mpercy","id":278148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3ODE0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/278148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpercy","html_url":"https://github.com/mpercy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpercy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpercy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpercy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpercy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpercy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpercy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpercy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpercy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpercy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-31T17:52:56Z","updated_at":"2017-01-31T17:52:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I think writing unit test for one of the actual effects of the wrapping wouldn't really test this change.\r\n\r\nWhy not?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/issues/comments/276439030/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/issues/comments/276443205","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/logging-flume/pull/106#issuecomment-276443205","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/issues/106","id":276443205,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NjQ0MzIwNQ==","user":{"login":"mpercy","id":278148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3ODE0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/278148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpercy","html_url":"https://github.com/mpercy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpercy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpercy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpercy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpercy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpercy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpercy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpercy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpercy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpercy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-31T18:07:59Z","updated_at":"2017-01-31T18:07:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Maybe it's not possible to test this change without running a MiniKdc or something.

One of the side effects of not doing so is that `BucketWriter` doesn't close the files (that was the original problem which led me to this bug), but there are other places where we call `PrivilegedExecutor.execute()`. None of those are prepared for `SecurityException`, so if we wanted to test this from the callers point of view we would need to create test cases for all the calls. \r\n\r\nI'm not against doing it, just my opinion is that they are simply too far from the change, the resulting test would be way too complex and hard to overview and would test many other things too. I would even call them integration tests, as they test a whole setup: Flume with some source and channel + hdfs sink with kerberos.\r\n\r\nAgain, I might be wrong and it may be possible to write better unit test for this but I couldn't come up with any significant improvement without making it unnecessary complex.

I don't think we have any unit test coverage of that right now, which is unfortunate (am I wrong about that?). You could add a test for this case without specifying which PrivilegedExecutor to use (i.e. just use the proxy object that is a protected member of TestBucketWriter), then parameterize TestBucketWriter so that we execute all test cases in both secure and non-secure modes.\r\n\r\nWe could test in a Kerberized env by instantiating a MiniKdc like we do in TestFlumeAuthenticator and using UGIExecutor with the same keytab we use there.
