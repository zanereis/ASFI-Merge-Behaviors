How do you currently instantiate 1.1 driver via `get_provider`? Looks like we only have a provider constant for version 1.0.\n\nI like the idea me and @Manganeez originally talked about. Each provider driver which has support for multiple API versions should only have a single provider constant and a base class which constructor takes `version` argument.\n\nBased on this version argument, base class would then instantiate a correct version-specific class - constructor method would basically be a factory method.

for this patch and a bug report!\n\nWhile reviewing and testing your patch I also found some bugs myself and I have merged your bug fixes and mine into trunk today - https://github.com/apache/libcloud/commits/trunk.\n\nI also wanted to include this fixes in the next release so I have canceled a vote for Libcloud 0.6.0 and started a new one for Libcloud 0.6.1 which includes those bug fixes.\n\nFor now I have also only merged essential bug-fixes, because I didn't want to introduce any new possible bugs which could creep in through the new features.\n\nI will merge new features into trunk as soon as you add tests for them. \n\nIf you need help with writing the tests, let us know ([Writing tests and using the fixture framework](http://libcloud.apache.org/docs/writing-tests-and-using-the-fixture-framework.html) page should also help you).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/2662816/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/2666409","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/36#issuecomment-2666409","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/36","id":2666409,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NjY0MDk=","user":{"login":"gigimon","id":297982,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5Nzk4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/297982?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigimon","html_url":"https://github.com/gigimon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigimon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigimon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigimon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigimon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigimon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigimon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigimon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigimon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigimon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2011-11-08T11:25:23Z","updated_at":"2011-11-08T11:25:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ok,

@tildedave actually had a good suggestion on the IRC.\n\nIt would be better for `NodeBase` to be a mixin instead of a base class. Here is an example of a Mixin class we use in tests - https://github.com/apache/libcloud/blob/trunk/test/compute/__init__.py#L20. Also, better name for this class would be `UuidMixin`.\n\nEdit: Basically, I would do the following:\n1. Name the base class `UuidMixin`\n2. Remove `__init__` and `__repr__` method and just keep `get_uuid` method\n3. Update affected code\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/3681835/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/3682350","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/55#issuecomment-3682350","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/55","id":3682350,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2ODIzNTA=","user":{"login":"keiko713","id":911433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMTQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/911433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keiko713","html_url":"https://github.com/keiko713","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keiko713/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keiko713/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keiko713/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keiko713/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keiko713/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keiko713/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keiko713/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keiko713/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keiko713/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-01-27T05:40:01Z","updated_at":"2012-01-27T05:40:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi, Tomaz.
