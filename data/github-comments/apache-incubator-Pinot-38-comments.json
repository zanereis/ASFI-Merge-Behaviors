Participant controller would be needed to add state model but for now since there's no `controllerResource` logic in this PR, participant role would only be shown in the cluster and won't have other effect yet. The only difference is that some tests checking the number of instances might need to update the expected number.\r\n2. Pinot only controller would be registered as both admin and participant role. Instead of participant role, admin role will do the stuffs as the controller in dual mode does. But since we haven't change the leadership logic in this PR yet, pinot-only controller is kind of useless by now, since it can't handle periodic tasks and realtime segment completion. I've added some code in controllerStarter to avoid using pinot-only controller in production. Once the whole logic has fully been merged, this role can be unlocked for production.\r\n3. I've tested this PR manually by setting up a cluster locally. Things are working fine, like adding table, uploading segments, etc.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/467620193/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/467648928","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/3869#issuecomment-467648928","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/3869","id":467648928,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NzY0ODkyOA==","user":{"login":"jamesyfshao","id":1062786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjI3ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1062786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesyfshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jamesyfshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesyfshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesyfshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesyfshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesyfshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesyfshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesyfshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesyfshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesyfshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesyfshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-26T22:54:47Z","updated_at":"2019-02-26T22:54:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@snleee @mcvsubbu could you guys help me to review this diff for fixing bug in low-level consumer?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/467648928/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/467666977","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/3885#issuecomment-467666977","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/3885","id":467666977,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NzY2Njk3Nw==","user":{"login":"sunithabeeram","id":3123798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjM3OTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3123798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunithabeeram","html_url":"https://github.com/sunithabeeram","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunithabeeram/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunithabeeram/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunithabeeram/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunithabeeram/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunithabeeram/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunithabeeram/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunithabeeram/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunithabeeram/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunithabeeram/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-27T00:04:54Z","updated_at":"2019-02-27T00:04:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Jackie-Jiang , is it possible to decouple the changes in this PR?

There's no change to the commit itself, but I've identified the exact cause for this. See the following:\r\n\r\nThe underlying interface for ZkClient in HelixManager has been changed to HelixZkClient. Using ZkClient directly is no longer recommended by Helix because it might cause ZkConnection leakage. However, the way Pinot uses ZkClient here is for testing purposes only, so we need to just replace the deprecated APIs with updated ones.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/468167263/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/468173440","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/3894#issuecomment-468173440","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/3894","id":468173440,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2ODE3MzQ0MA==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-28T07:53:46Z","updated_at":"2019-02-28T08:06:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#

Dont we also need to check time of idealstate update (step 3) ? The entire segment metadata commit should happen within a time t < MAX_SEGMENT_COMPLEZTION_TIME_MILLIS, so it is good to check before idealstate update whether that time is already past. — You are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.

The segment completion takes 3 steps (as documented in the code). There is also a ReatimeSegmentValidationManager that auto-creates non-consuming segments, if any (detected by the absence of step 2 or step 3 for the latest segment), and recognizes any new kafka partitions and starts consuming segments for them. It is possible that the RealtimeSegmentValidationManager recognizes an in-process segment commit as an incomplete one, and starts an attempt to fix it. It is also possible (in theory) that a segment completion takes so long that the ReatimeSegmentValidationManager has already fixed the segment before step 2 or 3. It is this case that we are protecting in the time check.\r\n\r\nAlso yes, it is possible that after the time check we go into a deep sleep state (thanks, GC) and wake up to update the ideal state. We are just reducing the chances here.\r\n\r\nWe will add this as a section to the realtime design doc.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/468769213/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/468814166","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/3900#issuecomment-468814166","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/3900","id":468814166,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2ODgxNDE2Ng==","user":{"login":"sunithabeeram","id":3123798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjM3OTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3123798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunithabeeram","html_url":"https://github.com/sunithabeeram","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunithabeeram/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunithabeeram/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunithabeeram/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunithabeeram/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunithabeeram/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunithabeeram/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunithabeeram/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunithabeeram/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunithabeeram/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-01T21:15:36Z","updated_at":"2019-03-01T21:15:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Couple of suggestions:\r\n- We can have init() present at all times - I don't see an issue with an empty implementation for most and overridable by the readers that need it.\r\n- We can make the reflection based support to be more general: If the users specify a record-reader class in the segment generation config, you can instantiate it and return.

This still does not fix the issue of silent failure. Logging error or throwing exception when it happens would be a good start. Ideally, we should be able to recover from the such situation and let users to pick on the behavior when such failure happens.\r\n> \r\n> 1. throw exception and stop consume message until a user restarts server with the new config if they don't want to skip the message.\r\n> 2. If their use case can tolerate skipping messages, we need to continue to consume from the next offset.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately. kafka simple consumer doesn't throw any exception while it encountered this issue. I have tested multiple version of kafka simple consumer library (from 0.9 to 1.1.1), they just simply stuck in a loop trying to read from network channel but failed due to there was no buffer left to host the next message. Eventually, there might be a socketTimeoutException after the consumer timed out from the configured value. However, this exception is fairly generic and it is very hard to tell it apart from just losing the connection from kafka broker (which is a retriable exception and reconnect to kafka should solve it).
