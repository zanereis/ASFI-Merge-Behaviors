your build history, it seems there is quite a bit of merging going on, and you may have been inadvertently triggering a lot of builds because of a quirk in Travis CI and GitHub's hooks:

I was taking a look also recent resource related commit to understand fully. \r\n\r\n1. This PR is well abstracted and shipped with enough unit test.\r\n2. And easy to share table type interpreter results with other interpreters. The only thing interpreter develop should do is creating it's own table data class (e.g `JDBCTableData`, `DataFrameTableData` as Leemoonsoo mentioned.) to be inserted into pool using interpreter specific low-level result (e.g `JDBCResultSet`, ...)\r\n3. This also enable us to create table data view for shared result in pools.\r\n\r\n@Leemoonsoo Now i have a question. (maybe this is future plan, but just for curiosity).\r\n\r\n- I can't imagine how one interpreter (e.g JDBC) can use shared table results from another interpreter (e.g spark.sql). I know we have APIs to get results from pool. But getting doesn't mean using (e.g querying) directly.

in InterpreterGroup.java\".\r\n\"Close (String sessionId)\" should only perform the action corresponding to the session.\r\nAnd if all sessions are closed, the process must be terminated.\r\nHowever, the current code always performs \"terminateRemoteProcess ();\" Within \"close (String sessionId)\".\r\n\"TerminateRemoteProcess ();\" The function forces all sessions to be terminated and the process
