I'm assuming Flyway will not try to reapply the scripts that it thinks it has already ran. Will their column types be converted to supported somehow magically by MySQL as part of their MySQL upgrade? \r\n\r\nOr will we end up with two types of schemas: ones which have been created with the Flyway scripts after these changes have been committed and therefore work with MySQL 8 - and other ones which have been created before, and continue to use the deprecated features?

The schemas and architectures are basically thesame as they were before: same names, same rules etc. The only changes that are done here are purely syntactic(Ex: changing deprecated declaration int(2) to the int which works fine with both v8 and v5.7 also changing charsets). Same logic, different syntax and again even the syntatic changes are minor.
