update versions of name servers or brokers to 5.x, just update the docker image. \r\n- If you want to deploy new modules in 5.x, you can use `apache/rocketmq-operator:0.4.0-snapshot`, which has not been published to OperatorHub yet:\r\n  - Clustering with new DLedger Controller: Pls deploy [Controller](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq-operator/blob/master/example/rocketmq_v1alpha1_console_cr.yaml) first and specify `clusterMode` as `CONTROLLER` for `Broker` cr.\r\n  - Proxy mode: It's still under development, you can refer this [pr](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq-operator/pull/134) for details.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1337226187/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1337250798","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/5646#issuecomment-1337250798","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/5646","id":1337250798,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl85PtNPu","user":{"login":"RongtongJin","id":21963954,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTYzOTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21963954?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin","html_url":"https://github.com/RongtongJin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-05T12:19:59Z","updated_at":"2022-12-05T12:20:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":">

If it's stored in the broker, then the broker needs to be upgraded. So let's suppose the proxy maintains the queue mapping relationship in memory. \r\n\r\nLet's take your example, there is a topic TopicTest, which contains broker-a{0,1,2,3} and broker-b{0,1,2,3} are mapping to broker-gateway{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}. \r\n\r\nHow does proxy deal with the case that the broker-a{0,1,2,3} scale to broker-a{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}? If the mapping is append-only, which means { broker-a{0,1,2,3}, broker-b{0,1,2,3},  broker-a{4,5,6,7} }, the rule will be different and inconsistent when proxy restart. If the mapping is  { broker-a{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}, broker-b{0,1,2,3} }, then the specified mapping will be changed and cause inconsistent pull behavior.\r\n\r\nIf the mapping rules are stored in the broker or even other storage like a database. The brokers' scale or offline behavior will also be a big challenge in maintaining the rules which need to be corrected when it happens.\r\n\r\nSo IMO, only supporting the new version client is the simplest way to keep the original protocol semantics. The support of remoting protocol in proxy is introduced in 5.0.1 as planned, so it's natural to support the client afterward.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1345983603/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
