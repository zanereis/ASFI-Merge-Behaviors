noted above, [DefaultSingletonBeanRegistry#containsSingleton](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/master/spring-beans/src/main/java/org/springframework/beans/factory/support/DefaultSingletonBeanRegistry.java#L285) is backed by a `ConcurrentHashMap`, the same map used by

you can see there, the code already does synchronization on that map and raises an `IllegalStateException` in case a ben with the given name is already present.\r\n\r\nGiven the implementation in Spring, I think that SYNCOPE-1488 should be fixed on Syncope in a completely different way, e.g. simply catching and logging the `IllegalStateException`, as all the needed concurrency control is - correctly BTW - performed by Spring
