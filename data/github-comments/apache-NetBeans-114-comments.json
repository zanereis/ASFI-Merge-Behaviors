Great work.\r\n\r\n> The no pull request - I have political issues with the central reliance on github more than anything (google code burnt me in the past amongst other reasons),\r\n\r\n\"code forges\" are temporary companions. there are projects which I moved from custom servers to sf to java.net to kenai and then to github (cvs -> svn -> git) and all of the forges did help with maintenance at some point in time. I don't think NetBeans currently overly relies on github, decisions, votes and discussion happen on the apache mailing lists. The little code details are solved in pull requests - which is fairly convenient.\r\n\r\nIf github would disappear there would be many alternatives the project could be moved to without much friction (for example gitlab, in fact someone could do it right now and host a mirror there). Also, funny enough, NetBeans uses 3 CI server clusters already (the official builds are done on jenkins / apache cluster), so the dependence there is also low.\r\n\r\nUsing a \"forge\" is the pragmatic choice for open source projects which are open to contributions in my opinion - doesn't matter which one (or how many in parallel).\r\n\r\n> Reviewing your own contributed patch seems like an oxymoron to me, what's involved?\r\n\r\nIt isn't since the patch is already modified and more work will be needed most likely before we merge.

I have systems from 8Gb - 64Gb, but even 64 Gb is not a guarantee for that.\r\n\r\nYou've done more than our regular bug reporter does so far, but you still have to do your homework monitoring what's happening on your machine.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1138957288/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1139146730","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/4149#issuecomment-1139146730","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4149","id":1139146730,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5D5f_q","user":{"login":"lkishalmi","id":1381701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODE3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1381701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi","html_url":"https://github.com/lkishalmi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-26T23:40:57Z","updated_at":"2022-05-26T23:40:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It's an interesting start.

Just OTOH (given the API), we might not even care, as the includedBuild (if I understood correctly) just replaces dependency with project dependency, but the project product artifact is still there. The dependency graph is also a snapshot of the final artifact resolution, so (IMHO) no change with included builds.\r\n\r\nI thouhgt about adding extension services for the additional queries (e.g. one could determine build segments / included builds), which could be project-type-dependent or (if we find a suitable abstraction) project independent - that's why raw (unspecified) data is exposed from ArtifactSpec / Dependency. I thought  about adding a `Lookup.Provider` to the `DependencyResult` to offer snapshot-bound additional services; but I was not able to see the details at the time of design.\r\n\r\nBTW - maybe the Maven Graph could be adapted to this API to see  graph dependency for Gradle too ;)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1139368993/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1139523899","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/4149#issuecomment-1139523899","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4149","id":1139523899,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5D68E7","user":{"login":"sdedic","id":26788611,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg4NjEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26788611?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic","html_url":"https://github.com/sdedic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-27T11:16:58Z","updated_at":"2022-05-27T11:16:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Just unreliable tests fail, merging.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1139523899/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1139585147","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/4158#issuecomment-1139585147","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4158","id":1139585147,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5D7LB7","user":{"login":"tmysik","id":331924,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTkyNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/331924?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik","html_url":"https://github.com/tmysik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-27T12:45:11Z","updated_at":"2022-05-27T12:45:11Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@junichi11 What about the CI failure?

PHP functions don't contain sufficient information in the declaration to allow the IDE to fully complete the return statement. An incomplete return statement is just like the bar method https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/3805#issuecomment-1139684802, (just without the space since the IDE can't guess that for PHP). The java editor does not add the semicolon there, the PHP editor probably shouldn't either. \r\nMaybe there should be two completion items for the `return` keyword. \r\n- One for `return;${cursor}` \r\n- and one for `return ${invokeCompletion}`.\r\n\r\nBut that is just an idea, as i mentioned twice already, I have limited knowledge of the PHP editor.\r\n\r\n> I don't think NetBeans is IDE for only Java...\r\n\r\ncorrect.

It's not a particularly large patch because it's a small file but it does change almost all the logic.  I'm sorry I don't really know how github works as i prefer just mailing diffs around so i'm not sure what's next.  I also apologise that I messed up the username in the commit and can't seem to change it in-place, but i suppose i can create another branch before submitting a pull request to fix that.  Is this the place to discuss or should i subscribe to the dev list?\r\n\r\nThe primary changes are using matches() rather than find() in the regex and using a buffer to stream.read().  The former has identical behaviour since the regex has a greedy match at both ends.  For the latter I believe the semantics should be the same (i.e. non-delayed reading) as InputStream.read() is documented to return when some data is ready and doesn't wait to fill the buffer.\r\n\r\nThere were also some serious logic problems with the existing code which has clearly been patched multiple times with 'hot fixes' which only hid any problems and also made the code worse. e.g. https://bz.apache.org/netbeans/show_bug.cgi?id=200365\r\n\r\nThere are several but one example 'logLevel' is passed around as an Integer and used as nullable flag to determine whether to use the 'outputstream' or the 'NbBuildLogger' variables for the output - however set*Stream() calls can set the logLevel when using a delegate stream or if os is null ... but that stream is never even used because logLevel gets set to non-null.  In fact the nbbuildlogger might not be present (hence the null checks for ow, etc).  There were also multiple places this stuff is checked and re-checked.  I've removed all that and replaced it with separate classes for each case to that both can work with guaranteed invariants and this greatly simplifies the logic and readability.\r\n\r\nOther smaller changes include using an ExecutorService to create and manage the threads, isolating the critical sections to small functions, removing ThreadDeath exception handling (only for Thread.close() which is never called), and removing things like flushing the output from the stop() function since this is always called in the finally block and so on.  And finally just rearranging the if() test for calling findHyperLinks to be clearer (that was hellishly confusing for such a simple check).\r\n\r\nI'm sorry I don't really use ant other than for the default netbeans and build.xml for modular projects (i use GNU Make for anything more complicated) so i'm not sure how to test it to the level such a set of changes require.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1140562254/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1140614945","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/3805#issuecomment-1140614945","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/3805","id":1140614945,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5D_Gch","user":{"login":"junichi11","id":738383,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczODM4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/738383?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11","html_url":"https://github.com/junichi11","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-30T02:21:14Z","updated_at":"2022-05-30T02:32:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I hope that this problem is fixed in the Editor.\r\nIt has worked for a long time as the expected behavior in the PHP editor until that change is included.\r\n\r\n> The java editor does not add the semicolon there, the PHP editor probably shouldn't either.\r\n\r\n\"PHP is not Java...\" and \"I don't think NetBeans is IDE for only Java...\" mean this...\r\nPlease imagine, when I fix something for the PHP feature in the Editor, the Java editor feature is broken.

The text substitution happens as fast as i can press return twice in a row.

If there would be just one constructor it would insert it right away. Thats also why #3805  loops forever since the completion itself sets the cursor to a location which resembles the initial conditions (and there is just one item in the completion list).\r\n\r\nedit: btw #4142 is working on removing a completion related bottleneck, but this isn't related to this PR here","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1142056903/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1142089416","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/4175#issuecomment-1142089416","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4175","id":1142089416,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5EEubI","user":{"login":"neilcsmith-net","id":3975960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3975960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net","html_url":"https://github.com/neilcsmith-net","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-31T12:46:37Z","updated_at":"2022-05-31T12:46:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks @pedro-w I'm inclined to close, but depends if you remember how those shortcuts were created - with the IDE UI or a plugin?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1142089416/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1142100242","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/4175#issuecomment-1142100242","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4175","id":1142100242,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5EExES","user":{"login":"pedro-w","id":22172519,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTcyNTE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22172519?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedro-w","html_url":"https://github.com/pedro-w","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedro-w/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedro-w/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedro-w/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedro-w/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedro-w/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedro-w/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedro-w/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedro-w/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedro-w/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-31T12:55:36Z","updated_at":"2022-05-31T12:55:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've revisited this.
