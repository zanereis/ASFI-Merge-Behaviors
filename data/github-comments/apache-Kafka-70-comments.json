For persistent store operations (RocksDB), today it has a in-memory LRU cache inside by default and hence may cause its read / write operations to be very cheap compared with its metrics recording operation. In KIP-63 (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-3776) we are extracting the cache out of RocksDB and hence this may no longer be the case.\n2. Approximate the metrics globally like I suggested before may not be a good solution as there can be cases where fine grained metrics are needed (actually we are working on a separate ticket to add even more metrics: #1446 ).\n3. About tuning metrics on / off, I agree that we'd better have some mechanism to only turn on part of the metrics for production deployment, while allow users to keep track of all metrics in the development phase yet. Today all state stores are wrapped by the MeteredStore class in order to provide all the metrics, and hence it is easier to make such wrapper optional (for example, by default we do NOT \"meter\" any stores, and users need to explicitly specify the state store names that they want to monitor).\n\nAs for this PR, we can still take the optimization on the consumer fetcher as @ijuma commented, while at the same time create a new story ticket for making a clear metrics hierarchy, and allow users to turn on at any level with a reasonable default, for example:\n\nlevel0 (stream thread global): per-record process / punctuate latency, commit latency, poll latency, etc\n\nlevel1 (per processor node, and per state store): IO latency, per-record .. latency, forward throughput, etc.\n\nAnd by default we only turn on level0.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/223455212/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/223455743","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1417#issuecomment-223455743","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1417","id":223455743,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMzQ1NTc0Mw==","user":{"login":"junrao","id":132330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjMzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/132330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-02T23:49:29Z","updated_at":"2016-06-02T23:49:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the patch.

For option 2, I think you need to be very careful. If you go that route, it seems like the `--new-consumer` and `--old-consumer` flags don't really do anything beyond having `--zookeeper` and `--bootstrap-server` opts. You could \"default\" to new consumer in the sense that if `--zookeeper` is not provided, any error messages would say that the new consumer parameters are required. This would guide new users of the command to the new consumer version, although clearly some users will still need the old consumer versions if they still have old consumer groups.\n\nWhat's unclear to me is whether including the `--old-consumer` flag makes much sense since a `--zookeeper` is required in that case anyway; it just makes the decision explicit and can help guide the user re: required arguments if the help message explains to select via `--old-consumer` and `--new-consumer` first, then gives help customized to each case.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/223631813/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/223632920","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1456#issuecomment-223632920","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1456","id":223632920,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMzYzMjkyMA==","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-03T16:53:44Z","updated_at":"2016-06-03T16:56:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks

Is the behavior expected to by dynamic? When I add a topic that matches the pattern I need to restart the stream to get the new topic picked up.\nAnd deleting a topic while the stream is running causes the program to crash with NullPointerException @`org.apache.kafka.clients.Metadata.getClusterForCurrentTopics(Metadata.java:257)`. Starting the stream again resets everything and the topic is dropped successfully.\n\nEDIT: I'm looking into fixing these issues now to allow for dynamic behavior\n\nEDIT 2: Fixed the NullPointerException when deleting a topic that was part of the KStreams (the NPE was occurring whether the topic was named or matched by regex).

filed https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-3763 for removing deprecated APIs in 0.11.0.\n\nPersonally, I don't see a lot of value in filing separate JIRAs as it will never be exhaustive and one needs to search the code when the time comes anyway. However, for cases where we already have a PR (like this one), then it makes sense to have a separate JIRA. I would suggest linking such JIRAs to KAFKA-3763.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/223843228/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
