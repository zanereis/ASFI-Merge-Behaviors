Mainly the 'executor' that is described in the documentation for Python doesn't seem to be documented with a working example for R. So, I ended up using part of this issue: https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/issues/1008\nWhere there is some code that is informative for my problem, and a good example is mentioned to be here: https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/master/R-package/R/model.R#L472\n\nThe model is practically the same as in the MNIST competition example for R so below is some code that you should be able to add to that. \n(http://mxnet.readthedocs.org/en/latest/R-package/mnistCompetition.html)\n\n#### Setup model configuration\n\nAs I noted, this is a convolutional net, since I wanted to get the outputs of the convolutional / pooling layers.\n\n``` r\n# input layer\ndata <- mx.symbol.Variable('data')\n# first convolutional layer\nconvLayer1 <- mx.symbol.Convolution(data=data, kernel=c(5,5), num_filter=30)\nconvAct1 <- mx.symbol.Activation(data=convLayer1, act_type=\"tanh\")\npoolLayer1 <- mx.symbol.Pooling(data=convAct1, pool_type=\"max\", kernel=c(2,2), stride=c(2,2))\n# second convolutional layer\nconvLayer2 <- mx.symbol.Convolution(data=poolLayer1, kernel=c(5,5), num_filter=60)\nconvAct2 <- mx.symbol.Activation(data=convLayer2, act_type=\"tanh\")\npoolLayer2 <- mx.symbol.Pooling(data=convAct2, pool_type=\"max\",\n                           kernel=c(2,2), stride=c(2,2))\n[unnamed-chunk-20-1.pdf](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/files/85846/unnamed-chunk-20-1.pdf)\n\n# big hidden layer\nflattenData <- mx.symbol.Flatten(data=poolLayer2)\nhiddenLayer <- mx.symbol.FullyConnected(flattenData, num_hidden=500)\nhiddenAct <- mx.symbol.Activation(hiddenLayer, act_type=\"tanh\")\n# softmax output layer\noutLayer <- mx.symbol.FullyConnected(hiddenAct, num_hidden=10)\nLeNet1 <- mx.symbol.SoftmaxOutput(outLayer)\n```\n\n#### Group symbols and creating an executor\n\nThe executor was done on the cpu rather than the gpu, since for the model above my gpu would run out of memory if I also ran the executor on the gpu. In hindsight, it of course looks a lot easier.\n\n``` r\n# Group some output layers for visual analysis\nout <- mx.symbol.Group(c(convAct1, poolLayer1, convAct2, poolLayer2, LeNet1))\n# Create an executor\nexecutor <- mx.simple.bind(symbol=out, data=dim(test.array), ctx=mx.cpu())\n```\n\n#### Train the model\n\n``` r\n# Prepare for training the model\nmx.set.seed(0)\n# Set a logger to keep track of callback data\nlogger <- mx.metric.logger$new()\n# Set gpu device\ndevices=mx.gpu(1)\n# Train model\nmodel <- mx.model.FeedForward.create(LeNet1, X=train.array, y=train_lab,\n                                     eval.data=list(data=test.array, label=test_lab),\n                                     ctx=devices, \n                                     num.round=1, \n                                     array.batch.size=100,\n                                     learning.rate=0.05, \n                                     momentum=0.9, \n                                     wd=0.00001,\n                                     eval.metric=mx.metric.accuracy,\n                                     epoch.end.callback=mx.callback.log.train.metric(100, logger))\n```\n\n#### Update the 'executor' parameters and outputs\n\nAfter training, update the executor weights, biases and parameters. \nIn this case, there were no auxiliary parameters, but I still added them to the executor for reference.\n\n``` r\n# Update parameters\nmx.exec.update.arg.arrays(executor, model$arg.params, match.name=TRUE)\nmx.exec.update.aux.arrays(executor, model$aux.params, match.name=TRUE)\n# Select data to use\nmx.exec.update.arg.arrays(executor, list(data=mx.nd.array(test.array)), match.name=TRUE)\n# Do a forward pass with the current parameters and data\nmx.exec.forward(executor, is.train=FALSE)\nnames(executor$ref.outputs)\n```\n\nThese are the names in the output:\n`## [1] \"activation0_output\" \"pooling0_output\" \"activation1_output\"`\n`## [4] \"pooling1_output\" \"softmaxoutput0_output\"`\n\n#### Visualize the output\n\nSo, in order to plot them (remember, I am using 28x28 pixel images from the MNIST dataset) you could run something like below to plot the output of the first 16 filters, \n\n``` r\n# Plot the filters of the 7th test example\npar(mfrow=c(4,4), mar=c(0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1))\nfor (i in 1:16) {\n    outputData <- as.array(executor$ref.outputs$activation0_output)[,,i,7]\n    image(outputData,\n          xaxt='n', yaxt='n',\n          col=gray(seq(1,0,-0.1)))\n}\n```\n\nI hope this might help other R users some time :+1:
