Thinking of injecting a mock catalog.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1210903566/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1211027899","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/5469#issuecomment-1211027899","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/5469","id":1211027899,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85ILtG7","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-10T17:28:20Z","updated_at":"2022-08-10T17:28:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks, @kbendick @szehon-ho!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1211027899/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1211065634","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4898#issuecomment-1211065634","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4898","id":1211065634,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85IL2Ui","user":{"login":"szehon-ho","id":20555759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTU1NzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20555759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho","html_url":"https://github.com/szehon-ho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-10T17:58:25Z","updated_at":"2022-08-10T17:58:25Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Yea you are right, it seems it will set the latest schema of each spec on the rewritten manifests, so the information is lost if you evolve schemas within a spec.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1211065634/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1211076671","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/5417#issuecomment-1211076671","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/5417","id":1211076671,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85IL5A_","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-10T18:09:24Z","updated_at":"2022-08-10T18:09:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Okay, I think I've reviewed all of the PRs.

you please provide a sample `MERGE INTO` query @SusurHe?\r\n\r\nWhen I think of dynamic partition pruning, I think of the ability to filter out specific partitions from the input table during a query based on some kind of `WHERE` clause, not necessarily the results of adaptive query execution.\r\n\r\nThe dynamic partition pruning I'm thinking of is controlled by the `SupportsRuntimeFiltering` interface, which was added in Iceberg 0.13.0.\r\n\r\nIf you could provide the `MERGE INTO` query, the results of `EXPLAIN` or the full explain output from the SQL UI, as well as generally the number of partition values that were touched (or at least the create table DDL of the table being merged into), that would help a lot to debug why you're not getting fewer partition files.\r\n\r\nHowever, from what's being provided, it's hard to tell if dynamic partition pruning, i.e. if partitions are pruned from the input before the join / processing, is taking place. But I get the impression that's not what you mean and you're more interested in adaptive query execution.\r\n\r\nIn either case, you might need to set `spark.sql.adaptive.coalescePartitions.parallelismFirst` to `false`.\r\n\r\nFrom the docs for `spark.sql.adaptive.coalescePartitions.parallelismFirst` found here: https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-performance-tuning.html\r\n\r\n`When true, Spark ignores the target size specified by spark.sql.adaptive.advisoryPartitionSizeInBytes (default 64MB) when coalescing contiguous shuffle partitions, and only respect the minimum partition size specified by spark.sql.adaptive.coalescePartitions.minPartitionSize (default 1MB), to maximize the parallelism. This is to avoid performance regression when enabling adaptive query execution. It's recommended to set this config to false and respect the target size specified by spark.sql.adaptive.advisoryPartitionSizeInBytes.`\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1212476159/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1212481879","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/5431#issuecomment-1212481879","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/5431","id":1212481879,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85IRQFX","user":{"login":"kbendick","id":9833362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MzMzNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9833362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick","html_url":"https://github.com/kbendick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-11T20:53:12Z","updated_at":"2022-08-11T20:53:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@aokolnychyi @rdblue I addressed all of your feedback.\r\n\r\nPlease take a look when you get a chance.

On the Kafka input side, schema registry is used to automatically deserialize or convert to `RowData` using latest schema. In the Iceberg output side, it will be useful to automatically pick latest table schema and write `RowData` using the latest table schema.\r\n\r\nIf the Flink job constructs the output RowData in code, this feature doesn't make sense since we need to change and deploy new code anyway.\r\n\r\nDo we need to enforce compatibility check here?

@amogh-jahagirdar, is this a good idea? I'm skeptical. If the aim is to have Redshift support, then I think Redshift should implement a way to call one of the APIs that can perform job planning instead.\r\n\r\nI find it unlikely that readers that do not support Iceberg tables will be able to read the files correctly and apply the schema evolution rules. I don't like the idea of making it easy for external systems to claim to support Iceberg tables via some export mechanism like this, but then give incorrect results because they're just reading Parquet files.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1214418013/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1214419724","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/5374#issuecomment-1214419724","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/5374","id":1214419724,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85IYpMM","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-14T17:31:18Z","updated_at":"2022-08-14T17:31:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks, @nastra!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1214419724/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
