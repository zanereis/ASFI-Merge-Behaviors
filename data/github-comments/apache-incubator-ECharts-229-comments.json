关闭showSymbol后，tooltip没法触发。感觉tooltip还是通过点的鼠标事件触发的，如果没有这些点，事件就没法触发。\r\n2. 关闭showSymbol。通过监听mousemove事件。但是这个没法知道当前鼠标离哪个线的哪个点更近。\r\n3. 关闭showSymbol。tooltip用axis触发，但是这个一下就触发一条线上的多个数据，在formatter内也没法知道当前鼠标离哪条线更近，因此要么每个有点的数据都显示，要么就都不显示。也不符合想要的效果。\r\n* 【求助】\r\n想问一下有没有哪个事件能够模仿tooltip的trigger=\"item\"的情景,

but please ask *how-to* questions on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/echarts) or [segmentfault（中文）](https://segmentfault.com/t/echarts). \n\nHere's why:\n\nMaintaining open source projects, especially popular ones, is [hard work](https://nolanlawson.com/2017/03/05/what-it-feels-like-to-be-an-open-source-maintainer/). As ECharts's user base has grown, we are getting more and more usage questions, bug reports, feature requests and pull requests every single day.\n\nAs a free and open source project, ECharts also has limited maintainer bandwidth. That means the only way to ensure the project's sustainability is to:\n\n1. Prioritize more concrete work (bug fixes and new features);\n2. Improve issue triaging efficiency.\n\nFor (1), we have decided to use the GitHub issue lists exclusively for work that has well-defined, actionable goals. Questions and open ended discussions should be posted to mediums that are better suited for them.\n\nFor (2), we have found that issues that do not provide proper information upfront usually results in terribly inefficient back-and-forth communication just to extract the basic information needed for actual triaging. This is exactly why we have created this app: to ensure that every issue is created with the necessary information, and to save time on both sides.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/519344321/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/519346436","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/10975#issuecomment-519346436","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/10975","id":519346436,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxOTM0NjQzNg==","user":{"login":"deqingli","id":13548221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTQ4MjIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13548221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deqingli","html_url":"https://github.com/deqingli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deqingli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deqingli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deqingli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deqingli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deqingli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deqingli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deqingli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deqingli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deqingli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-08T03:16:21Z","updated_at":"2019-08-08T03:16:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Please
