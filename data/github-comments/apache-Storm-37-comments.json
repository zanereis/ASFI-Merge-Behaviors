My understanding is that the topology is expected to eventually ack() all messages.  And if I understand right, if a worker JVM or host crashes, then the message will eventually timeout due to the topology.message.timeout.secs setting in backtype.storm.Config, and it will then be re-submitted to the topology and the new worker should ack() it at that point - since the new worker will still use the same kafka offset  for the key in my retryRecords map that the crashed worker was using.</p>\n\n<p>    I'm not 100% sure that covers everything, but as I have it, it's also working the same way cleanup of the _pending collection has been working and still is.  Also, I wonder if it is a good thing that there will be a visible problem if some topology is failing to ack its messages - in the form of running out of memory in this case.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612489846/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/55202793","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/254#issuecomment-55202793","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/254","id":55202793,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MjAyNzkz","user":{"login":"rick-kilgore","id":4665096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NjUwOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4665096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rick-kilgore","html_url":"https://github.com/rick-kilgore","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rick-kilgore/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rick-kilgore/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rick-kilgore/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rick-kilgore/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rick-kilgore/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rick-kilgore/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rick-kilgore/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rick-kilgore/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rick-kilgore/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-09-11T00:09:21Z","updated_at":"2014-09-11T00:09:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Of course, it's the least I can do - we're really benefiting from this awesome platform.
