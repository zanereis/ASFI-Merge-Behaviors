But I think we need to go over it. My main concern is the addition of the clearField method to the Persistent class. Two main thoughts on it:\n- We should try to keep the main Persistent API as stable as possible because we have some dependencies on it e.g. goraCompiler, and therefore all the avro generated beans we create from it. \n- This method is proposed for clearing the values of MemStore. So it would seem that only MemStore needs it. So I am not sure we need to add it to main API. Why don't we use a method like getPersistent? What do you guys think @lewismc @djkevincr ?\n  The other thing that I think we need to change is how the deleteByQuery is working now. I mean it's great that is not breaking anymore :D but I think we need and IfElse stmt after the if(allFields) because if we have deleted the specific key, then why do we need to iterate through the fields? \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gora/issues/comments/215258302/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gora/issues/comments/215446689","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gora/pull/61#issuecomment-215446689","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gora/issues/61","id":215446689,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNTQ0NjY4OQ==","user":{"login":"djkevincr","id":1346010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDYwMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1346010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/djkevincr","html_url":"https://github.com/djkevincr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djkevincr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djkevincr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djkevincr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djkevincr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djkevincr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djkevincr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djkevincr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djkevincr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djkevincr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-28T14:36:57Z","updated_at":"2016-04-28T14:36:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@renato2099 +1, I also agree with your concerns.

NICE WORK :)\nSome comments\n1. Please include Javadoc for all of your publicly available methods, Classes and also add package-info.java to every package you create.\n2. Please ALWAYS catch and log Exception's within your LOG message e.g. ```LOG.error(\"Log message here\", e) \n3. Please ALWAYS use parameterized logging e.g. `LOG.info(\"Log {} and {} values\", value1, value2)`\n4. My main question is, what is going on with the testing? Are you setting up the Hazelcast test infrastructure or how is the Mock testing working? This needs to be added to the test class and needs to be explained directly there. Also why are you not extending DataStoreTestBase?\n5. As far as I can see, you've not added this to the gora-tutorial meaning that no-one can run this entire module easily. Please make sure to add it to the gora-tutorial.\n6. Please add this to gora-goraci, we will wish to test it in the Cloud shortly and may even write Docker containers for all of this.\n\nIf you can lease address the documentation and logging issues first then notify me that would be great.\n\nAgain, great work. Nice to see this coming along.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gora/issues/comments/237711527/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gora/issues/comments/237801890","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gora/pull/72#issuecomment-237801890","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gora/issues/72","id":237801890,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNzgwMTg5MA==","user":{"login":"lewismc","id":1165719,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjU3MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1165719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc","html_url":"https://github.com/lewismc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-05T09:10:44Z","updated_at":"2016-08-05T09:10:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"OK\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gora/issues/comments/237801890/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gora/issues/comments/237808584","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gora/pull/72#issuecomment-237808584","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gora/issues/72","id":237808584,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNzgwODU4NA==","user":{"login":"lewismc","id":1165719,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjU3MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1165719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc","html_url":"https://github.com/lewismc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-05T09:43:36Z","updated_at":"2016-08-05T09:43:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The
