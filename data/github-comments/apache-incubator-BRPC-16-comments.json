no shared_mutex or rw_mutex in brpc since we always found better alternatives in related problems. \r\n\r\nAn alternative is to use mutex+shared_ptr(or intrusive_ptr): the reader code only copies shared_ptr inside the mutex and accesses the content outside; and the writer code has 2 options: 1. build a new content and replace the old content inside the mutex (copy-on-write); 2. like reader, copy the shared_ptr inside lock and modify the content outside, which still races with the readers and may need another mutex.\r\n\r\nPros: the time spent inside the critical section is always copying a shared_ptr which is a ref adding and lightweight. As a contrast, the writer of shared_mutex may still block all readers.\r\n\r\nCons: additional indirection, unfriendly for small values.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brpc/issues/comments/441163510/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brpc/issues/comments/441219140","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/brpc/issues/582#issuecomment-441219140","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brpc/issues/582","id":441219140,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MTIxOTE0MA==","user":{"login":"dyike","id":4496772,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0OTY3NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4496772?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyike","html_url":"https://github.com/dyike","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyike/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyike/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyike/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyike/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyike/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyike/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyike/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyike/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyike/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-23T11:36:15Z","updated_at":"2018-11-23T11:36:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"https://github.com/brpc/brpc/blob/master/docs/cn/server.md","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brpc/issues/comments/441219140/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brpc/issues/comments/441221420","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/brpc/issues/582#issuecomment-441221420","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brpc/issues/582","id":441221420,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MTIyMTQyMA==","user":{"login":"scottzzq","id":1217132,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTcxMzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217132?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottzzq","html_url":"https://github.com/scottzzq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottzzq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottzzq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottzzq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottzzq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottzzq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottzzq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottzzq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottzzq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottzzq/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-23T11:47:51Z","updated_at":"2018-11-23T11:47:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@dyike
