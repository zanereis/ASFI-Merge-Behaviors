I think we're mixing up different file types. The decoder that you pointed out in the example, is an Avro decoder that adheres to the [Avro spec](https://avro.apache.org/docs/1.11.1/specification/#primitive-types-1). int and long values are written using [variable-length](https://lucene.apache.org/java/3_5_0/fileformats.html#VInt) [zig-zag](https://code.google.com/apis/protocolbuffers/docs/encoding.html#types) coding.\r\n\r\nThe decoding of the single values happens using the `_from_byte_buffer` method, which produces the same result as your example:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1134248/202548298-9d440258-e061-4447-b6a4-768add7b4f3d.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1319141897/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1319146864","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/6210#issuecomment-1319146864","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/6210","id":1319146864,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85OoJVw","user":{"login":"alec-heif","id":5010391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMTAzOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5010391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alec-heif","html_url":"https://github.com/alec-heif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alec-heif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alec-heif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alec-heif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alec-heif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alec-heif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alec-heif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alec-heif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alec-heif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alec-heif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-17T20:12:00Z","updated_at":"2022-11-17T20:12:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"hoooo wow ok that's embarrassing, thanks for correcting!!

I tried adding more specific types, like a type for the bound expression in case it was different, but it didn't seem to matter much to mypy so going with a single type param for unbound expressions seems to work the best. I also wasn't able to remove the ignore annotation in the constructors.\r\n\r\nMerged this. Thanks for all the work here, @Fokko! I'll rebase my expression PR on this and also open one to fix a few of the nits.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1320982239/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1320983739","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/6139#issuecomment-1320983739","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/6139","id":1320983739,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85OvJy7","user":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-19T22:32:52Z","updated_at":"2022-11-19T22:32:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for merging @rdblue, much appreciated.

For example, if a user opens two sessions to submit queries, we might want to reuse the underlying pool. I guess this is the use case described in @pvary 's previous [comment](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/6175#issuecomment-1315286360).\r\nThe problem is we cannot design an appropriate cache key that fits requirement from different engines. So maybe we can have `CachedClientPool` as the default cache (or disable caching by default), but allow engines to override it with custom implementations?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1321554962/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1321565947","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/6222#issuecomment-1321565947","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/6222","id":1321565947,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85OxX77","user":{"login":"hililiwei","id":59213263,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MjEzMjYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59213263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei","html_url":"https://github.com/hililiwei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-21T07:25:53Z","updated_at":"2022-11-21T07:25:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@stevenzwu @openinx @rdblue  @Fokko    could you please take a look at it when you get a chance? thx.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1321565947/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1321577620","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/6223#issuecomment-1321577620","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/6223","id":1321577620,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85OxayU","user":{"login":"ajantha-bhat","id":5889404,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODk0MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5889404?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat","html_url":"https://github.com/ajantha-bhat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-21T07:38:57Z","updated_at":"2022-11-21T07:38:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> @ajantha-bhat Can you please do another quick check.
