I am not frontend expert. Just going through the PR and have a few thoughts:\r\n\r\n1. The changes in frontend seems a little large. What if we add new UI control ? Do we also need to check the sequential running state ?\r\n2. I have another idea for this problem. How about doing the most of the work in backend ? Backend know whether it is in sequential running mode. So that backend can send back error message to frontend if user do a ui operation on a note which is in sequential running state. e.g. when user click the clone button, zeppelin can pop up a error message to show that this operation is not allowed as it is in sequential running state. This might be much easier to do. But I might be biased. Need more thoughts from some frontend guys.
