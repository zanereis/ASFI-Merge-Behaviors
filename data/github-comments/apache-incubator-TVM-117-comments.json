Thank you for the review comments.\r\n\r\n> the .qsys and .tcl files still have quite a bit of bulk to them, is there a way to minimize that?\r\n\r\nI have already removed unrelated components in the `.qsys` file, it's still large mostly because the detailed settings that related to the HPS configuration (e.g. DDR settings, HPS clocks etc.) is still there. I can try a bit more to figure out whether it can be generated with the help of [qsys_tcl](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/programmable/us/en/pdfs/literature/hb/qts/qsys_tcl.pdf) and [ug-qps-platform-designer](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/programmable/us/en/pdfs/literature/ug/ug-qps-platform-designer.pdf).\r\n\r\nThe majority of the `.tcl` file contains pin assignments that related to the chip `5CSEBA6U23I7`. I think I can use for-loops to reduce its size.\r\n\r\n> I'm thinking that these auto-generated files could be dropped in the 3rd party dir under intel/de10 to separate what is user generated and what is part of DE10 packaging (files autogenerated by Intel)\r\n\r\nDid you mean I can put them at `3rdparty/intel/de10-nano` or `vta/hardware/intel/de10-nano`?
