a colossal pain. I'd ask why Python can't agree on how text works but that would trivialize how really hard it is to get right (and Python is way better than it used to be at this).\r\n\r\nWe can fix that by wrapping the binary file in a unicode codec reader.\r\n\r\n```\r\ntextstream = codecs.getreader('utf-8')(request.files['file'])\r\nd = json.load(textstream)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWorks in 3.5, also works in 3.6; 🤞 that it will work in 2.7.\r\n\r\nWe can also put the reader as a file level constant (no real preference on my end):\r\n\r\n```python\r\nUTF8_READER = codecs.getreader('utf-8')\r\n...\r\nd = json.load(UTF8_READER(request.files['file']))\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we want to support more than UTF-8, we could use [chardet](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/chardet) to determine the encoding but, in my opinion, that's overkill.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/356722674/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/356731107","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2899#issuecomment-356731107","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2899","id":356731107,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NjczMTEwNw==","user":{"login":"j16r","id":344071,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDA3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/344071?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/j16r","html_url":"https://github.com/j16r","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j16r/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j16r/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j16r/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j16r/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j16r/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j16r/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j16r/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j16r/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j16r/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-10T20:45:56Z","updated_at":"2018-01-10T20:45:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @gwax, that seemed to do the trick.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/356731107/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/356731163","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2927#issuecomment-356731163","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2927","id":356731163,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NjczMTE2Mw==","user":{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-10T20:46:07Z","updated_at":"2018-01-10T20:46:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Please check the flake8 errors.
