It needs clarification if this PR is meant to get into NB 18 or not.\r\n- if not -> change milestone to NB 19 please\r\n- if it is intended to get into NB 18, it has to be rebased onto the `delivery` branch and the target has to be changed to `delivery` too\r\n\r\nI am fairly neutral on this, but since jakarta support is a bit limited atm, I would be ok in taking the risk to integrate a larger PR like this one here even during the RC phase. Usually we would try to integrate only bug fixes during the RC phase. (edit: I mean this is technically a bug fix, but it touches a lot of files)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1522343778/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1522741983","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/5866#issuecomment-1522741983","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5866","id":1522741983,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5awzLf","user":{"login":"juneau001","id":121002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/121002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juneau001","html_url":"https://github.com/juneau001","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juneau001/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juneau001/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juneau001/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juneau001/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juneau001/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juneau001/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juneau001/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juneau001/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juneau001/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-26T04:00:07Z","updated_at":"2023-04-26T04:00:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I believe I have addressed all of the comments with the exception of renaming from jakarta.web.beans to web.beans.jakarta.

I had a few situations when someone asked me something like \"the change is in the staged upstream lib, can you test it?\". And the \"easiest\" way to test it was to build it locally, remove the entry from binaries-list and load it from disk. Would have been nice to open a draft lib-update PR (add the dev-build label) and simply run tests with it (but before merge, wait for GA and change the dependency to central obviously).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1526047678/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1526053981","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/5893#issuecomment-1526053981","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5893","id":1526053981,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5a9bxd","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-27T17:13:34Z","updated_at":"2023-04-27T17:13:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'll look into this later, but at this point in time, you can trivially use an URL in binaries-list.

This is intended. I am not sure how important the usecase is to start the indexing right after a manual cancel again. I agree that the \"index now\" button needs to be looked at since it is only for the local index and this is not clearly communicated in the UI. Restart after cancel is more of a dev testing issue for me and less of a common usecase.\r\n\r\n> Multithreaded indexing should IMHO be enabled by default \r\n\r\nI don't want to do this before filtering is available since this has an index size overhead. This would be another PR. We also got feedback of notebook usage etc which I don't want to ignore either.\r\n\r\n> I suggest for the popup: \r\n\r\nI will take a look at this. But I won't implement \"run once\" for now since this complicates things unnecessarily. Indexing is not a run-once feature, either you turn it on or off. Cancelling pauses it as mentioned before.\r\n\r\n> Looking at the indexing notification: Will this be a problem for LSP?\r\n\r\nlikely. `IndexingNotificationProvider.java` has one method more now, if this isn't implemented and nobody sets the permission, indexing won't run now.
