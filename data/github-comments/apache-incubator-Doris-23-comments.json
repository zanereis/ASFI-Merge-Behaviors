join\".","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/624625042/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/624633156","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/3396#issuecomment-624633156","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/3396","id":624633156,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNDYzMzE1Ng==","user":{"login":"wangbo","id":12951030,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTUxMDMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12951030?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangbo","html_url":"https://github.com/wangbo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangbo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangbo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangbo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangbo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangbo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangbo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangbo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangbo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangbo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-06T12:57:56Z","updated_at":"2020-05-06T12:57:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"resolve

First, we do tuple convert columnVector and **time consuming of conversion operation is recorded.**\r\n```\r\n{\r\n          Timer time;\r\n          FOREACH_ROW_LIMIT(in_batch, group_start, cache_size, in_batch_iter) {\r\n              // Hoist lookups out of non-null branch to speed up non-null case.\r\n              TupleRow *in_row = in_batch_iter.get();\r\n              for (int i = 0; i < agg_fn_evals_.size(); ++i) {\r\n                   void** values = static_cast<void **>(valuesVector[i].col_data());\r\n                   values[count] = agg_fn_evals_[i]->getAggValue(in_row);\r\n              }\r\n\r\n              for (int i = 0; i < ht_ctx->get_key_size(); ++i) {\r\n                   void** keys = static_cast<void **>(keysVector[i].col_data());\r\n                   keys[count] = ht_ctx->get_key(in_row, i);\r\n              }\r\n              count++;\r\n          }\r\n          _cost_time += time.stop();\r\n      }\r\n```\r\n* 2. Then we do aggregate use column storage\r\n```\r\n        EvalAndHashPrefetchGroup(keysVector, count, ht_ctx, remaining_capacity, tuples);\r\n        for (int i = 0; i < agg_fn_evals_.size(); ++i) {\r\n             UpdateTuple(agg_fn_evals_[i], tuples, static_cast<void**>(valuesVector[i].col_data()), count);\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\n* 3. Execute the following query statement in a table of 70 million。```select max(C_PHONE) from customer group by C_MKTSEGMENT;``` \r\n\r\nCount the time of aggratetation. we can find deducte the time of row conversion, **the time cut in half**.\r\n\r\n   Statistic|origin| row convert to column  | \r\n  :-:|:-:|:-:\r\n  Time | 4.19 Sec | 2.47 Sec | \r\n \r\n* 4. In this case, the performance is improved through the **execution model of the column store**。\r\n   In addition to the aggregatenode, another part of POC is the expression calculation and filtering part, such as AND OR filtering calculations whether can be improved by vectorization.\r\n**Join and sort can be ignored in this period, so if the query contains join or sort, it needs to be able to identify and use non vectorized execution path for execution by query planning.**\r\n\r\n### Implementation and Design Detail\r\nThere is three important parts: **Rewriting of scannode, Rewriting of expression calculation, Rewriting of aggregatenode**.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Rewrite the scanner section first:\r\n* At present, for agg key and unique key, it is necessary to perform data pre aggregation and\r\nother operations by heap sort. **It seems default to avoid the transformation of columns and\r\nrows. So we only implement vectorized execution in dup_key.** \r\nwe can use **Rowblockv2 to be an abstraction of the column storage model, it is used to transfer data between each node**。we don't need convert **Rowblockv2 to old Rowblock**.\r\n* Implement the vectorization of individual expression (For example, the first phase can only\r\nimplement simple expressions such as =/</>).\r\n\r\nWe can make a judgment when querying the plan. If query on dup_key and only have simple expressions,\r\nthe vectorization interface will be called. The pseudo code is as follows:\r\n```\r\nVectorizedBatch vbatch = _reader->next_batch_with_aggregation();\r\nvector<rowId> selectedRowId = Expr.eval(vbatch);\r\nconvertVecBatchToRowBatch(vbatch, selectedRowId, output_rowbatch);\r\n```\r\n**If there are other expressions that are not supported temporarily, continue to use the old interface.** The input of new and old interfaces is different (one is row, the other is vbatch), but the output is the same (both are the original rowbatch of query layer)\r\n\r\n* Support more expr calculations, such as IN, FUNCTION and so on. **Finally implement all vectorization\r\nexecution in scanner stage.** The output of scanner to the upper layer is still the old rowbatch, **but the internal layer and the storage layer is vectorized.**\r\n![After rewite the scanner](https://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/8552201-e1ba42199edb1a47.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Rewrite the scannode section second:\r\n\r\n* **Rewrite the interface between scan node and scanner to vectorization.** The ultimate goal is output of the upper layer of the sctopan node is the old rowbatch, but the output of the lower layer of the scan node (scanner and storage layer) is vectorized。\r\n\r\nSo far, the changes of scan part and expr part are basically completed. We can rewrite the aggregate node now.\r\n![After rewite the olap_scan_node](https://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/8552201-213bb59042197868.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240)\r\n\r\n#### Rewrite the aggregatenode section finally:\r\n* Design and implement a new hash table structure that is compatible with the column storage model\r\n* Rewrite the computing model of the corresponding aggregation operator to support the vectorization\r\n\r\n* After all of that，**the final goal of the first phase is to vectorize the aggregate query of a single table.**\r\nIf there is a join of multiple tables or a sort node, the old execution logic is still used. \r\n\r\n\r\n![After rewite the Aggregation_node](https://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/8552201-54681e865bbd8c1c.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240)\r\n\r\nLater, we can gradually extend the vectorization calculation to other execution nodes. **It's going to be a long-term plan.**\r\n\r\n#### RelationShip between Rowblock, Rowblockv2, Columnblock\r\n@kangkaisen \r\n* **Rowblock is an old definition. At present, the storage layer and query layer still use rowblock interface to pass data.** The query layer accesses the data inside rowblock through rowcursor. Data in rowblock is stored\r\nby row.\r\n* **Rowblockv2 is a new definition which is vectorized. It contains multiple columnblocks.** Each columnblock is a column of data. Rowblockv2 is actually the newly defined vectorizedrowbatch.New segment V2 data is read in rowblockv2 format. The BetaRowsetReader will convert rowblockv2 to rowblock to returns the data.\r\n\r\n* The reader gets the next line at a time through the internal collect iterator. The collect iter will merge all rowsetreaders and return by row. **The merger operations here are based on rowcursor and rowblock.So it needs to be rewrite reader first.**\r\n\r\n* Now Doris has dup_key, agg_key and unique_key storage models. Dup_key does not need to do aggregation logic. **So we can first transform this part that directly deliver the corresponding data to the upper layer through columnvector rather than row_cursor.** At present, for agg key and unique key, it is necessary to perform data pre aggregation and other operationsby heap sort. It seems default to avoid the transformation of columns and rows.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/625759402/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/625760711","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/issues/3517#issuecomment-625760711","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/3517","id":625760711,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNTc2MDcxMQ==","user":{"login":"imay","id":1249159,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDkxNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1249159?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay","html_url":"https://github.com/imay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-08T10:58:01Z","updated_at":"2020-05-08T10:58:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This is a good job.\r\nHowever I think something maybe discussed clearly before writing code.\r\n1.
