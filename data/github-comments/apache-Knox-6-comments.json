I'm pretty worried about where this is going - where it looks like it spawns shells on the Knox host.

Most of the newer UIs are using npm to at least ensure we are declaring our dependencies.\r\n> \r\n> https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KNOX-2631 doesn't seem to have much detail about the design of this feature so not sure if this is POC or what, but I don't think its close to ready to be merged.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed POC status. @luliu8 is interning with us and this is a first iteration PR. The codereview details are great here, @risdenk and will help clean this up for the next iteration. The security implications are also being considered and will ultimately be reviewed closely. The idea here is to strictly allow the same sort of trusted proxy based impersonation for Shell access as we do for all other proxied resources. We will need the same level of protections for this as we have for hadoop trusted proxies.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/issues/comments/894688536/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/issues/comments/896771977","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/knox/pull/480#issuecomment-896771977","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/issues/480","id":896771977,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQgj3s41c6eJ","user":{"login":"zeroflag","id":641365,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MTM2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/641365?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag","html_url":"https://github.com/zeroflag","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-11T12:09:57Z","updated_at":"2021-08-11T12:09:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"cc:

@moresandeep for the detailed comment. Let me try to answer your questions.\r\n\r\n> Github does not let me click on line numbers that have not changed so adding my comments here. Why do we have some places that use in-memory implementation and some places that do not? it is a bit confusing.\r\n\r\nI tried to keep the in-memory lookups where we fetch data that cannot be changed. So that it's gonna be the same on each node all the time (until the token is removed/expired).\r\n\r\n> I think instead of removing the token completely can we adjust the TTL just for the metadata in case of JDBC to be short, say 3-5 mins and we can have that as a \"margin of error\". Or instead of removing the code, use a switch to figure out when HA is enabled so that non-HA JDBC implementations can still benefit from the cache performance. Thoughts?\r\n\r\nI'd the idea of replacing the current `ConcurrentHashMap` caches into `Caffeine.Cache` instances but we would still have an issue with eventual consistency within the configured entry TTL in those caches (\"margin of error\"). I discussed this approach with @zeroflag and we felt that it'd be pre-mature optimization that can be added later if we hit any performance issues. On the other hand, I'm open to re-evaluate that area if we insist this has to be done now.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/issues/comments/915064438/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/issues/comments/915227354","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/knox/pull/490#issuecomment-915227354","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/issues/490","id":915227354,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQgj3s42jULa","user":{"login":"moresandeep","id":380997,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MDk5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/380997?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep","html_url":"https://github.com/moresandeep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-08T13:12:55Z","updated_at":"2021-09-08T13:12:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I'd the idea of replacing the current `ConcurrentHashMap` caches into `Caffeine.Cache` instances but we would still have an issue with eventual consistency within the configured entry TTL in those caches (\"margin of error\").

Testing this feature at the Filter level is cumbersome because of the infrastructure related code and dependencies (servlet api and such), so the more extensive tests are in `VirtualGroupMapperTests`, `ParserTest` and `InterpreterTest`. Those are more focused and easier to write tests for.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/issues/comments/1049771263/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/issues/comments/1057274206","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/knox/pull/541#issuecomment-1057274206","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/issues/541","id":1057274206,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQgj3s4_BLle","user":{"login":"smolnar82","id":34065904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDY1OTA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34065904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82","html_url":"https://github.com/smolnar82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-02T18:59:19Z","updated_at":"2022-03-02T18:59:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Flamingo93 - the screenshot you attached does not show proof that Trino UI is accessible via Knox (https://trino_ui_host:9084/ui).
