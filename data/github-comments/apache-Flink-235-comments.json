have to check whether the tests do something wrong or the code in the PR uses wrong assumptions.\r\n\r\nI've verified manually that the `CONCURRENT_ACCESS_CHECK` setup works properly outside of tests. I'm wondering whether we can test this as well in `flink-end-to-end-tests`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/370772028/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/370795266","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/5645#issuecomment-370795266","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/5645","id":370795266,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MDc5NTI2Ng==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-06T14:18:15Z","updated_at":"2018-03-06T14:18:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks

For example, `MiniClusterClient.submitJob()` does a `miniCluster.runDetached(jobGraph)`, and `MiniClusterClient.cancel()` does `miniCluster.cancelJob(jobId)`. The problem is that the legacy cluster does not have methods for those things, namely \"cancel\", \"get job status\", \"get accumulators\", and \"savepoint\". All existing ITCases use custom Akka communication with the testing cluster. We can either add methods for all that to the legacy mini cluster (that would probably also use Akka) or use the `StandaloneClusterClient`, which also uses Akka. But for those Akka messages to work we can't run it in single-actor-system mode.
