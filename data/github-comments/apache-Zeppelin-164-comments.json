-k secret -P -md sha1\r\n```\r\nI'm not sure it's preferred way or there's any better way to create key.\r\nAnyway, It'll be easier to use if we can document this new environment variable with how to generate key in `/docs/setup/operation/configuration.md`.\r\n\r\n#### Protect AES key\r\n\r\nIn my understanding, if any user can get both AES key (in `conf/zeppelin-env.sh`) and `conf/credentials.json`, user can decrypt the file.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? will there be a way to prevent user get both key and encrypted
