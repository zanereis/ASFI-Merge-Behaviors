The cause of hive support broken in spark master is due to we copied the implementation of `hiveClassesArePresent` of spark 2.0 in zeppelin, but `hiveClassesArePresent` is changed in spark master. So instead of checking different classes for different spark versions, here I propose to checking class `InsertIntoHiveTable` which is public.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/293472455/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/293480523","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/986#issuecomment-293480523","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/986","id":293480523,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MzQ4MDUyMw==","user":{"login":"ekantheshwara","id":26997923,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTk3OTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26997923?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekantheshwara","html_url":"https://github.com/ekantheshwara","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekantheshwara/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekantheshwara/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekantheshwara/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekantheshwara/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekantheshwara/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekantheshwara/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekantheshwara/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekantheshwara/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekantheshwara/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-12T05:51:04Z","updated_at":"2017-04-12T06:01:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@prabhjyotsingh \r\n\r\nI dont see a call made to AD to check the group membership when a Notebook is accessed.
