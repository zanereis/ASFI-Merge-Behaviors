In this commit: https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/commit/37301ed4540450c29be4f975d58b38dbeec6c296#diff-6adc687ad4a13d4b956fdc638299401b `domain_vlan_map` is introduced. When adding a new range on domain, a new entry on `domain_vlan_map` is created. As `IpAddressManagerImpl#fetchNewPublicIp` lists non dedicated zone wide vlans, but always returns range corresponding to vlan id = 1 (as there's no entry for it on domain_vlan_map) - check `ZoneWideNonDedicatedVlanSearch` search builder on `VlanDaoImpl`.\r\nWhat do you think will be the best solution for this case?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/336240972/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/336250591","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/2048#issuecomment-336250591","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/2048","id":336250591,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNjI1MDU5MQ==","user":{"login":"blueorangutan","id":16489489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDg5NDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16489489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan","html_url":"https://github.com/blueorangutan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-12T20:05:33Z","updated_at":"2017-10-12T20:05:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<b>Trillian
