If we want to ignore tomcat, we must do this in the dubbox component. Do you agree?\r\n\r\nIf yes, at that moment, tomcat plugin's beforeInvoke  has already finished, so `span` and its tags have been generated, and stored in memory. Even we can ignore the tomcat plugin span, the improvement focuses on the cost of network/collector-side, right?\r\n\r\nIf you agree all of these, we are on the same page.
