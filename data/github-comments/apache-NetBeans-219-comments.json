The class does I/O operations that may block for several seconds, so it can't be used purely on the event dispatch thread without regularly locking up the UI.\r\n\r\nIn the Clipboard.addFlavorListener/removeFlavorListener case, you can call either method from any thread, but the actual events will be delivered on the Event Dispatch Thread. The fact that addFlavorListener/removeFlavorListener can block for several seconds (due to lock contention with the I/O-heavy getContent operation) was almost certainly unintentional, but calling them off-thread avoids the problem of locking up the UI.\r\n\r\nReviewing the logic again, I can try to justify why the proposed code is safe...\r\n* A race condition bug around the systemClipboard.addFlavorListener call is avoided by ensuring that fireChange() is called only _after_ the systemClipboard.addFlavorListener has returned (to ensure that we don't \"miss\" a fireChange() call), and by confirming that fireChange() does no harm if called an extra time (it looks fine).\r\n* A race condition bug around the systemClipboard.removeFlavorListener call is avoided by the fact that the RequestProcessor RP has a throughput of one (thus adding/removing listeners will happen in order), and the fact that extra calls to flavorsChanged do no harm.\r\n* Looking at flavorsChanged, I see that it skips the call to fireChange() if anyWindowIsActivated == false. I confirmed that whenever anyWindowIsActivated is set to true (in the handler for WINDOW_ACTIVATED), this is followed by a new call to fireChange (via scheduleGetFromSystemClipboard(true) and GetContents.run).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2309134233/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2309274839","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/7695#issuecomment-2309274839","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7695","id":2309274839,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6JpLzX","user":{"login":"EaganFarlin","id":55567338,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTY3MzM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55567338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EaganFarlin","html_url":"https://github.com/EaganFarlin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EaganFarlin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EaganFarlin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EaganFarlin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EaganFarlin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EaganFarlin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EaganFarlin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EaganFarlin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EaganFarlin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EaganFarlin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-26T04:16:47Z","updated_at":"2024-08-26T04:16:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I see, thank you for letting me know.

I invested nearly one day into hunting the cause - and was only able to cure some symptoms.\r\nThe main issue is that the project Lookup initializes lazily; although the project impl itself uses `ProxyLookup.setLookups`, the delegates (actully wrapped `FolderLookup` ) start to initialize / recognize layer registrations and only after a while they asynchronously finalize, firing events that are propagated upwards through wrapper ProxyLookups. \r\n\r\nThis is a general problem and affetcs all (even production) code that uses pattern:\r\n```\r\nProject p = FileOwnerQuery.findOwner(someFile);\r\nOpenProjects.open(new Project[] { p }, false);\r\nOpenProjects.openProjects().get();\r\nSources srcs = ProjectUtils.getSources(p);\r\n```\r\nthough the client code even opens the project in a hope it will be fully initialized afterwards, the Sources may report no source groups as the java-specific provider might not be recognized/loaded yet. This happens randomly.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I've introduced [waitForProjectLookup](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/7665/files#diff-efbe457805d005d95375ecf666a13cac9b397d17855e7911e4e4445acf34a9c2R47) that hides a hacky way how to wait for the project lookup's implementations to initialize.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2315091892/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2315280943","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/7641#issuecomment-2315280943","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7641","id":2315280943,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6KAGIv","user":{"login":"naren2605","id":16515049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTE1MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16515049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/naren2605","html_url":"https://github.com/naren2605","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naren2605/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naren2605/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naren2605/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naren2605/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naren2605/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naren2605/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naren2605/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naren2605/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naren2605/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-28T13:11:17Z","updated_at":"2024-08-28T13:11:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"thank you @mbien ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2315280943/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2315766293","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/7694#issuecomment-2315766293","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7694","id":2315766293,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6KB8oV","user":{"login":"troizet","id":9607501,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MDc1MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9607501?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/troizet","html_url":"https://github.com/troizet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/troizet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/troizet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/troizet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/troizet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/troizet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/troizet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/troizet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/troizet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/troizet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-28T16:12:41Z","updated_at":"2024-08-28T16:17:11Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Regarding the button, I still tend to believe that it is necessary.
