And as Erik suggested, you have to make sure the version of jackson jars in druid's hdfs classpath or hadoop environment, matches with that of the jars come with druid core.

requested I am sharing our use case. We're using a TSV in S3 for a namespace lookup (at least to start with, we will probably switch over to a JDBC source eventually). We have a single key column, which always corresponds to the same actual dimension in Druid. We have a dozen lookup columns (could grow by a handful, but I'd think no more than 20). And we're starting pretty small now with only about 100K rows, but expect that could grow to several million rows before too long. \n\nWe don't need this updated really frequently. Actually we're still working out our ETLs and so forth to deal with revisions and additions to the lookup data. But I wouldn't expect us to have updates more frequently than hourly, and probably more like daily.\n\nAs far as pain points with this arrangement - there is sure plenty of boilerplate in the config. I have an array of a dozen entries in `druid.query.extraction.namespace.lookups` that are identical in all fields except for `namespace` and `valueColumn`. A bit clunky but not so much that I'd complain about it really - I did write a couple of simple scripts that generate the stuff to be placed in config.\n\nI'm more concerned about the overhead when we do update the lookup source. Druid will have to load and parse this (potentially sized) 20 x 3M TSV once per lookup. I haven't done any benchmarking but I have noticed that it can take on the order of 15 seconds to completely load our current 12 x 100K case. Even if it takes a few minutes that is not a gamebreaker (assuming it does not interfere with query performance or produce inconsistent results while in progress). But it certainly seems like it could be a lot more efficient to load and parse the file once instead of 12 or 20 times.\n\nOverall, the configuration and use feels a bit clunky, I think because from the user point of view, we have just one \"lookup namespace\" - there is a single source, and a single key column. It would feel more natural to define the data source level properties (uri, format, columns) and key column once, along with a list of allowed targetColumns, then use it in dimension specs and filters by referencing just the one single namespace plus a targetColumn. It might start to look like an ingestion spec at that point, with dataSchema- and ioConfig-like sections. \n\nBut honestly I don't know how much of a priority I'd want it to be. Associating a single namespace with a single key column and multiple value columns might well be overfitting to our specific case, and it 's certainly quite usable as it stands. \n\n(One side note, the ability to include columns in the CSV which are not key or value columns is useful for assembling the data manually - we can include \"friendly name\" sort of columns that are helpful to people who are filling in or auditing the actual lookup data.)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/206446537/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/206447000","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/2738#issuecomment-206447000","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2738","id":206447000,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNjQ0NzAwMA==","user":{"login":"drcrallen","id":8213081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMTMwODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8213081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen","html_url":"https://github.com/drcrallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-06T16:17:25Z","updated_at":"2016-04-06T16:17:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This is incompatible but the static config is probably going away anyways.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/206447000/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/206486746","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/2523#issuecomment-206486746","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2523","id":206486746,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNjQ4Njc0Ng==","user":{"login":"drcrallen","id":8213081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMTMwODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8213081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen","html_url":"https://github.com/drcrallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-06T17:51:57Z","updated_at":"2016-04-06T17:51:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"thanks @ryryguy \nThe use case you are talking about seems more like a join than a lookup kind of use case.

We don't want to trigger mass re-ingestion of the primary data whenever someone corrects a typo in an address or the like.\n\nAlso, we would only be querying one dimension from the lookup at a time, but we will allow multiple filters selecting against it. (Slowish performance if multiple lookup filters are selected would probably be acceptable, that is not a primary or major use case.)\n\nOne trick I suppose we could do if the length of the lookup started causing problems would be to split them into smaller lookups. The key column in the lookup is a campaign id.  (Rows in Druid represent phone calls; campaigns to phone calls are one-to-many.)  In our business entities campaigns are owned by accounts.  All our queries will also filter on a primary account id. So we could make one TSV per account, embedding the account id in the namespace names. That could cut down the maximum length of a lookup dramatically, though at the cost of increased complexity in marshalling and configuring the lookups. \n\nIf we do need to optimize for performance does that seem like a good approach? Or would having larger numbers of smaller lookups run into different problems?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/206523616/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/206547948","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/2716#issuecomment-206547948","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2716","id":206547948,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNjU0Nzk0OA==","user":{"login":"drcrallen","id":8213081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMTMwODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8213081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen","html_url":"https://github.com/drcrallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-06T20:30:17Z","updated_at":"2016-04-06T20:30:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"FYI, I'm taking a crack at the kafka extension because the updates to make it lookup friendly are non-trivial\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/206547948/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/206557842","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/2541#issuecomment-206557842","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2541","id":206557842,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNjU1Nzg0Mg==","user":{"login":"xvrl","id":815147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNTE0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/815147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl","html_url":"https://github.com/xvrl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-06T20:43:41Z","updated_at":"2016-04-06T20:44:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@navis can you describe the use-case for this?

examine the success and fail log. I suspect the problem come from \"Version\" fields in task's spec.\n\nVersion is generated both for `determine task` and `index task`.\nMost of the cases, the two versions are very close, for example:\n(in succ_chg.txt)\n`2016-03-24T08:31:47.081+08:00` and `2016-03-24T08:31:47.082+08:00`\n\nBut sometimes, the two versions may have the same version number.\n(in file_not_found_chg.txt)\n`2016-03-23T10:11:34.355+08:00` and `2016-03-23T10:11:34.355+08:00`\n\nThe `version` is used to cretae temp directory name\n(in HadoopDruidIndexerConfig.java)\n\n```\n  public Path makeIntermediatePath()\n  {\n    return new Path(\n        String.format(\n            \"%s/%s/%s/%s\",\n            getWorkingPath(),\n            schema.getDataSchema().getDataSource(),\n            schema.getTuningConfig().getVersion().replace(\":\", \"\"),\n            schema.getUniqueId()\n        )\n    );\n  }\n```\n\nIf `determine task` and `index task` have the same `version`, they will have same `intermediatePath`.\n\nWhen this happend, the intermediate path will be removed after `determine task` finished.\nAnd because the second task have the same intermediate path, it will not upload the jars again during checking from JobHelper.\n\n```\n  static void addSnapshotJarToClassPath(\n      File jarFile,\n      Path intermediateClassPath,\n      FileSystem fs,\n      Job job\n  ) throws IOException\n  {\n    // Snapshot jars are uploaded to non shared intermediate directory.\n    final Path hdfsPath = new Path(intermediateClassPath, jarFile.getName());\n\n    // existing is used to prevent uploading file multiple times in same run.\n    if (!existing.contains(hdfsPath)) {                  //hamlet-lee: here, path conflicts\n      uploadJar(jarFile, hdfsPath, fs);\n      existing.add(hdfsPath);\n    }\n    job.addFileToClassPath(hdfsPath);\n  }\n```\n\nSo, there are 3 possible solutions:\n1) change logic of HadoopDruidIndexerConfig.makeIntermediatePath() to generate a unique directory name each time\n2) change logic of JobHelper.runJobs(), and remove the deleted paths from JobHelper.existing\n3) change the logic of `version` generating\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/206790602/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/206819768","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/2708#issuecomment-206819768","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2708","id":206819768,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNjgxOTc2OA==","user":{"login":"hamlet-lee","id":12079531,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDc5NTMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12079531?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamlet-lee","html_url":"https://github.com/hamlet-lee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamlet-lee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamlet-lee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamlet-lee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamlet-lee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamlet-lee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamlet-lee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamlet-lee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamlet-lee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamlet-lee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-07T11:08:35Z","updated_at":"2016-04-07T11:08:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Updated
