I have been reviewing your branch, and I think I've reviewed the latest (with-test/without-ProGuard) version of it (hence my earlier review comments, and your replies to them).\n\nHave I missed a message or am I looking at the wrong thing?  (I have been and am looking at this [Pull Request #116](https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/116).)\n\nAlso, your mention of rebasing sounds like a reference to a preceding request to rebase, but I don't see or recall any mention of rebasing your patch.\n\nLooking again, I see that I just skimmed over the class loader that's just for the test.  Is it that you wanted more review of that class?\n\nOh--it is that I hadn't indicated that I was done reviewing it because I didn't give a +1 yet?  I hadn't done that before because I was waiting for confirmation on my SLF4J question.

isn't a complete solution, you can put a semi-colon in a string literal (and maybe a column name in backticks?), so this might end up chopping queries in half. I think this is the real reason why this bug wasn't fixed earlier, because it needs to be handled at the parser level. Its possible that calciate handles this and we are not making use of it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/144543634/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/144545578","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/178#issuecomment-144545578","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/178","id":144545578,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NDU0NTU3OA==","user":{"login":"adeneche","id":8422943,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MjI5NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8422943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeneche","html_url":"https://github.com/adeneche","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeneche/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeneche/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeneche/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeneche/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeneche/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeneche/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeneche/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeneche/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeneche/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-30T21:17:14Z","updated_at":"2015-09-30T21:17:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"a quick hack would be to just check if the very last character of the query is a semi-colon and remove it from the query.
