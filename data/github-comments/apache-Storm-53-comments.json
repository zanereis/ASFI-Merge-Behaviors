I didn't take that approach because it would require significantly more changes to the spout since `DynamicBrokerReader` doesn't reference `KafkaConfig` or `SpoutConfig` currently. Also it would require a modification to `DynamicBrokerReader`'s constructor to accept a `KafkaConfig` instance breaking legacy code. I thought that would be a big change for a minor storm release.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612517022/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/68803852","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/365#issuecomment-68803852","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/365","id":68803852,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4ODAzODUy","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-05T23:51:45Z","updated_at":"2015-01-05T23:51:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@dashengju Great!
