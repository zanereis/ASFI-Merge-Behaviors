Thanks for the explanation. This makes quite a lot of sense. I recently added a new Dstream + an associated Flume sink to fix the issue of receivers being hard-coded on the Flume config. Basically solves the same issue, by telling the Spark receiver where the Flume agents are running. So even if the executors die, they can come back and simply poll the same Flume agents for data. In my experience, the hosts on which the agents are running rarely change - so this solution works nicely.
