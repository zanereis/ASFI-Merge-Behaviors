@aziubin, thanks a lot reporting the issue and trying to fix it. I was able to craft the test case and reproduce it (again, because of your very detailed report). \r\n\r\nSadly the solution you are suggesting is covering only one specific variation of the problem. For example, when argument is removed in between (last argument is omitted, we would end up with `wrong number of arguments`). Another issue is primitive types: by stripping the `REMOVED_MARKER` placeholder you are effectively trading it for `null` which does not play well with primitive Java type (in this particular case, imagine that argument in the middle is `int`, we end up with `argument type mismatch` anyway).\r\n\r\nI don't have the solution off the top of my head, also it would be great to consult the SOAP spec regarding the cases when operation parameters are omitted.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/1324464561/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/1325016138","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cxf/pull/1031#issuecomment-1325016138","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/1031","id":1325016138,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQMOR85O-iRK","user":{"login":"jimma","id":91742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxNzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimma","html_url":"https://github.com/jimma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-23T12:57:15Z","updated_at":"2022-11-23T12:57:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> FYI, we may go directly to 6.0.1 [1], the due date is tomorrow\r\n> \r\n> [1] https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/milestone/309\r\n\r\nYes.

MessageContentsList is core functionality, which is used everywhere in CXF, so we should be careful. Unfortunately, `REMOVED_MARKER` was made publicly accessible, although its meaning (the indication of missing value in the list) points that it should be private or protected and not leave the methods of the class. As long as `REMOVED_MARKER` is not referenced in the code of other classes it is I think safe to stop returning it outside in the inherited toArray method. If there is a suspicion that other inherited methods of the ArrayList might be used too, we may address them as well to prevent potential defects. Below is another example of misbehavior because `REMOVED_MARKER` is passed outside of MessageContentsList class:\r\n```\r\nimport javax.validation.constraints.NotNull;\r\nimport javax.validation.Valid;\r\n. . .\r\n\tpublic boolean allocate(Integer projectId,\r\n\t\t\t@Valid @NotNull Object targetIds,\r\n\t\t\t@Valid @NotNull Integer[] parameterIds) { }\r\n```\r\nWhen targetIds parameter is omitted, the NotNull rule will not work because `REMOVED_MARKER` instance is passed as argument to the targetIds parameter, although `null` should have been passed instead. This case is covered with this fix too.\r\n\r\n> If we have to cover the omitted operation input, we should cover such cases as well, we should not be asking users for workarounds.\r\n\r\nI might not completely understand this. Do you mean for existing code, or when developing new one assuming that parameter can be omitted? When `REMOVED_MARKER` argument is passed to primitive type it is not compatible, as well as when `null` is passed instead, so this fix as I can see does not change the behavior with primitive types for existing code, but only the error message. I do not have CXF expertise as yours, so let me know if I am missing something.

In this hypothetical situation, `removed` hash set of the original `MessageContentsList` will not be taken into account, and all markers will be lost in new instance of `MessageContentsList`. With original implementation all removed markers will be presented. To solve this, we may change code like below:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> public MessageContentsList(List<?> values) {\r\n>     super(values);\r\n>     if (values instanceof MessageContentsList) {\r\n>         removed = new HashSet<>(((MessageContentsList) values).removed);\r\n>     }\r\n> }\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> I verified that `MessageContentsList` is never passed as argument of `MessageContentsList(List<?> values)` in CXF source code and this additional change can be necessary just to keep backward compatibility if existing custom code passes `MessageContentsList` to `MessageContentsList(List<?> values)`.\r\n\r\nIt makes perfect sense, thank you @aziubin , the suggested change is pushed","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/1331255715/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/1331969825","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cxf/pull/1033#issuecomment-1331969825","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/1033","id":1331969825,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQMOR85PZD8h","user":{"login":"aziubin","id":33120458,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTIwNDU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33120458?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aziubin","html_url":"https://github.com/aziubin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aziubin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aziubin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aziubin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aziubin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aziubin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aziubin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aziubin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aziubin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aziubin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-30T10:56:03Z","updated_at":"2022-11-30T10:56:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@reta thanks.
