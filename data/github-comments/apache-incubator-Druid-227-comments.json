A PriorityQueue is a Min-heap so it sounds like it is already doing close to what I was suggesting.  \r\n\r\nAs for the HLL-Map Sketch, one of its requirements was that it keep every key and its latest count estimate on every unique key that it has seen to allow arbitrary queries of any key.

Being \"stuck\" on an old copy of the code is no worse than being stuck on an old version of the lib.\r\n\r\nYes it is ad hoc because it shouldn't be normal practice. Some of the functionalities are superseded by updates to other core libraries (like in the JRE itself) and the longer term support ones should be favored. Some can be modified to use apis that have long term support from Guava (or similar libraries) and should probably do that. But for some, the only way to maintain long term support in druid is to do it ourselves. Either by straight up copying the code, or by providing some introspection mechanism.\r\n\r\nIf you are worried about tracking how often we do this, maybe a 3rdparty module would suffice? We would keep code that has this kind of long-term-support wrappers in there?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/470631559/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/470642646","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/7154#issuecomment-470642646","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7154","id":470642646,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MDY0MjY0Ng==","user":{"login":"fjy","id":428325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODMyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy","html_url":"https://github.com/fjy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-07T18:35:06Z","updated_at":"2019-03-07T18:35:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@leventov any more comments?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/470642646/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/470661898","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/6953#issuecomment-470661898","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6953","id":470661898,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MDY2MTg5OA==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-07T19:30:14Z","updated_at":"2019-03-07T19:30:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@drcrallen Just saw you push a commit; the groupId in extensions-core/google-extensions/pom.xml still needs adjustment to `org.apache.druid.extensions`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/470661898/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/470667167","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/7181#issuecomment-470667167","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7181","id":470667167,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MDY2NzE2Nw==","user":{"login":"glasser","id":16724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glasser","html_url":"https://github.com/glasser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glasser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glasser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glasser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glasser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glasser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glasser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glasser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glasser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glasser/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-07T19:45:43Z","updated_at":"2019-03-07T19:45:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The concern here is that batch ingestion tasks will get in the way of other ingestion tasks.

If we did it, it should really be done in an automated fashion, so we can easily stay up to date. But @drcrallen's has appeal too. A wholesale copy of a relatively large project like Guava into Druid is a bit ugly, so @drcrallen's approach is more elegant in my eyes. And we don't have to maintain a system that automates copying Guava into Druid as Guava evolves. And it gives users more control over what Guava version they run. #6948 also has the advantage of already being coded up. And, if we use the Guava 11 and Guava 'latest' profiles in CI, we can make sure that we are _actually_ compatible, giving us that 'guaranteed to work' assurance.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, my opinion is let's go with @drcrallen's proposal.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/470765890/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/470766141","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/7209#issuecomment-470766141","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7209","id":470766141,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MDc2NjE0MQ==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-08T01:17:13Z","updated_at":"2019-03-08T01:17:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Btw, did you just mean docs?
