Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\n> \n> - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\n> \n> - [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\n> \n> - [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\n> \n> - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License
