The way we should solve this is to change the URI in the metadata to point to a remote store for completed realtime segments\r\n\r\nAre you suggesting in case of non-local storage, Pinot servers by-pass Pinot controllers to download the segment from remote directly. I think that is a good idea (and we in fact talked out this during last meeting) but it is out of scope of this PR in my opinion because:\r\n(1) PinotSegmentUploadRestletResource right now does not work with Pinot FS -- so it is a bug we should fix unless we want to delete this resource.\r\n(2) Currently in LLC, in the common path the commit servers anyway need to pass segments to Pinot controller during commit. The download segment path is in fact a less common code path. So I do not see the point of doing the less common path optimization before we solve the whole problem of by-passing Pinot controller for segment data transfer.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/479703907/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/479706993","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/4065#issuecomment-479706993","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/4065","id":479706993,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3OTcwNjk5Mw==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-04T00:38:49Z","updated_at":"2019-04-04T00:38:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#

I have captured some responses here. We can discuss further in person if needed.\r\n> We need to have a design doc for all the interfaces and do a team discussion on this\r\n\r\nWe did have an internal discussion exactly on this today and its unfortunate that while you were present during that discussion the concerns weren't brought up there. We have an internal doc discussing the details - I will create an external version of the doc soon.\r\n\r\n> StreamMessageMetadata is not general enough, and is a concrete class which is introduced to the general interface of MutableSegment\r\n\r\nI am not sure its a good idea to make everything as an interface simply because its getting exposed through an interface. I can see that the name StreamMessageMetadata does tie it to streams a bit more than we want associated with MutableSegment - I can change this to RowMetadata.\r\n\r\n> 2. The ingestion time and index time do not make sense for offline (immutable) segment but got added to the SegmentMetadata interface.\r\n\r\nI definitely went down the path of splitting SegmentMetadata interface into mutable and immutable. Currently, SegmentMetadata exposes methods such as refreshTime(), pushTime() which don't quite apply to mutable data. I finally backed out of that path because of the way MutableSegmentImpl currently manages the segment-metadata (using inline variables instead of explicit setters/getters) - and given that the metadata gets update for every row ingested, I decided to keep with the current approach than introduce additional overhead by making explicit method calls everytime.

The offline tables take up time in the calls to upload segments. On local tests, they can take upto 20s per table. We have 2 such uploads. Based on this, the initial delay for the checker was set to 2 minutes. But this could take longer depending on the setup.\r\nRemoving the 30s delay for realtime tests. Instead, increasing the time for beginning tests, as this will affect all tables setup after the uploads. Again, there's no guarantee that the setup will be done in 3 minutes, but practically, it does finish.\r\n@sunithabeeram

A few more questions:\r\n- How big of a response is being sent back? Resize typically increases exponentially, so we shouldn't see too many resizes. I have chased some of these resize based optimizations in the past - although the theory is sound for runtime as well as garbage generated, the gains typically didn't materialize - which is why I am bit skeptical about this. If you have numbers to share for after this fix, that will help. Also, if possible, attaching the CPU profile snapshot showing the hotspot would be nice.\r\n- Should metadata serialization take the same approach? I am wondering if we are sending a lot more metadata back; that part of the code still doesn't initialize the size.\r\n- I didn't see a comment on the testing for this. Do we have existing tests covering all the paths for this method?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/484147859/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/484196775","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/4127#issuecomment-484196775","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/4127","id":484196775,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NDE5Njc3NQ==","user":{"login":"Jackie-Jiang","id":17555551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTU1NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17555551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang","html_url":"https://github.com/Jackie-Jiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-17T17:56:50Z","updated_at":"2019-04-17T17:56:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @Jackie-Jiang The byte array `buf` is encapsulated in `byteArrayOutputStream` and cannot directly be accessed though.
