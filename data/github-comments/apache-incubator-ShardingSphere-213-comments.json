And have a easy  way  to extend security algorithm.  this pr is not influence any function or perfermance for proxy in default config. I hope you can accept it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/884720630/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/884738500","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/11438#issuecomment-884738500","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/11438","id":884738500,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAvkN_M40vAnE","user":{"login":"dachuan9e","id":46773294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NzczMjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46773294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dachuan9e","html_url":"https://github.com/dachuan9e","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dachuan9e/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dachuan9e/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dachuan9e/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dachuan9e/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dachuan9e/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dachuan9e/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dachuan9e/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dachuan9e/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dachuan9e/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-22T08:23:47Z","updated_at":"2021-07-22T08:23:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/pull/11432\r\n\r\nPlease check if the latest code in master branch has fixed this issue. @","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/884738500/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/884742463","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/11447#issuecomment-884742463","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/11447","id":884742463,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAvkN_M40vBk_","user":{"login":"yx9o","id":12792261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzkyMjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12792261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yx9o","html_url":"https://github.com/yx9o","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yx9o/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yx9o/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yx9o/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yx9o/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yx9o/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yx9o/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yx9o/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yx9o/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yx9o/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-22T08:31:03Z","updated_at":"2021-07-22T08:31:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"hi, can i modify it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/884742463/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
