There are two key changes in this PR: 1. Converting a `case class Foo() extends Serializable` into `case class Foo()`.  2. Converting a `class Foo() extends Serializable` into a `case class Foo()`.\n\nCase 1 is good, since it is redundant to mixin `Serializable` into a `case class`.\n\nBut we have to be careful with the case 2, since scala forbids case-to-case inheritance, in other words, we cannot have another `case class Bar() extends Foo()`. In these examples, users may want to extends an existing `TrainingData` and create multiple subclass, each serving slightly different purpose. Because of the case-to-case restriction, even if we have base `case class FOO()`, all subclasses still need to be a non-case-class, which defies this PR's purpose of \"fixing mixed usage of case class and class with serializable interface.\"\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/predictionio/issues/comments/202520831/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/predictionio/issues/comments/202603202","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/predictionio/pull/205#issuecomment-202603202","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/predictionio/issues/205","id":202603202,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwMjYwMzIwMg==","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-28T22:23:50Z","updated_at":"2016-03-28T22:23:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@yipjustin I see.
