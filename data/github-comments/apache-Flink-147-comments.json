tested the `AUTO` config behaviour, and it works as expected in EMR / EC2 environments, so the Kinesis API part should be working fine.\r\n\r\nLet me summarize the new behaviour after the proposed changes (@tony810430 please correct me if I've got anything wrong):\r\n- If no credential provider type is provided, `AUTO` is used.\r\n- If the user has provided `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, regardless of the credential provider type provided (i.e. even if it's set to `AUTO` / `SYS_PROPS` etc.), the `BASIC` type will be used.\r\n\r\nThe second behaviour seems a little odd to me; in general, I think the `AWS_CREDENTIALS_PROVIDER` setting should have higher precedence.\r\n\r\nAlso, logic between `validateAwsConfiguration` and `AWSUtils.getCredentialsProvider()` seems a bit too \"coupled\" now with the proposed changes. I think we should probably fallback the value of `AWS_CREDENTIALS_PROVIDER` for the user in `validateAwsConfiguration`. What I have in mind for `validateAwsConfiguration`:\r\n\r\n- if the user hasn't set any value for `AWS_CREDENTIALS_PROVIDER`, we set it for them - if access key and secret access key exists, set `BASIC`, otherwise just use `AUTO` (the default).\r\n- if the user has a value for `AWS_CREDENTIALS_PROVIDER`, just leave it as is.\r\n\r\nIn `AWS_CREDENTIALS_PROVIDER`, we can then just start of by reading the `AWS_CREDENTIALS_PROVIDER` property and instantiate credentials accordingly.\r\n\r\n@tony810430 what do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/267266706/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/267271165","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2925#issuecomment-267271165","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2925","id":267271165,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NzI3MTE2NQ==","user":{"login":"tzulitai","id":5284370,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODQzNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5284370?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai","html_url":"https://github.com/tzulitai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-15T08:47:58Z","updated_at":"2016-12-15T08:47:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for working on this @tony810430!\r\n\r\nI'd like to discuss a bit on the design before a more detailed review for this PR.

(cc @StephanEwen, f.y.i.)\r\nAfter a second closer look, I'm afraid this PR can't be merged as is. Sorry Tony for not having realized earlier.\r\nThe problem is that the state redistribution of `ListCheckpointed` doesn't work with the Kinesis consumer's current shard discovery mechanism.\r\n\r\nOn restore, each subtask uses the restored states it gets to appropriately set the \"last seen shard ID\" of the subtask. With this value set, the subtask is able to discover only shards after the \"last seen shard ID\". Then, the subtask determines which of the newly discovered shards it should be responsible of consuming, using a simple modulo operation on the shards' hash values.\r\n\r\nThis works before when restored state could not be redistributed, because subtasks will always be restored shards which belong to that subtask (i.e. via the modulo on hash operation).\r\n\r\nThe state redistribution on restore for `ListCheckpointed` breaks this. For example:\r\nJob starts with only 1 subtask for FlinkKinesisConsumer, and the Kinesis stream has 2 shards:\r\nsubtask 1 --> shard1, shard2.\r\n\r\nAfter a restore with increased parallelism to 2, let's say the list state gets redistributed as:\r\nsubtask 1 --> shard1\r\nsubtask 2 --> shard2\r\n\r\nSubtask 1's _last seen shard ID_ will be set to `shard1`, and will therefore discover `shard2` as a new shard afterwards. If `shard2` gets hashed to subtask 1, we'll have both subtasks consuming `shard2`.\r\n\r\nChanging the hashing / subtask-to-shard assignment determination for the shard discovery probably can't solve the problem, because no matter how we change that, it'll still be dependent of what the list state redistribution looks like.\r\n\r\nThe only way I can see in solving this would probably be have merged state on restore, so that all subtasks may set the \"last seen shard ID\" to the largest ID across all subtasks, not just the local subtask.\r\n\r\nIn [flip-8](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/FLIP-8%3A+Rescalable+Non-Partitioned+State) I see the community has discussed an interface for merged state also (a unioned list state on restore). I think that will be really useful in this particular case here. It'll also be relevant for the Kafka connector, right now it seems irrelevant only because the Kafka consumer doesn't have partition discovery yet.\r\n@StefanRRichter could you probably provide some insight on the merged state aspect? I'm not that familiar yet with the recent works and progress on the repartitionable states.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/267378437/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/267379213","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2984#issuecomment-267379213","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2984","id":267379213,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NzM3OTIxMw==","user":{"login":"vasia","id":498957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5ODk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/498957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia","html_url":"https://github.com/vasia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-15T16:51:47Z","updated_at":"2016-12-15T16:51:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @mushketyk, thank you for the update!\r\nJust a couple of small things and we can merge:\r\n- Can you add a note in the beginning of the docs that bipartite graphs are only currently supported in the Gelly Java API?\r\n- I would rename the \"Graph transformations\" section to \"Projection\".","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/267379213/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/267379453","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3001#issuecomment-267379453","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3001","id":267379453,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NzM3OTQ1Mw==","user":{"login":"StefanRRichter","id":2128543,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjg1NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2128543?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter","html_url":"https://github.com/StefanRRichter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-15T16:52:40Z","updated_at":"2016-12-15T17:00:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I have an open PR #2948 that would introduce all the facilities (w/o API) for global and union state.

I will do that.\r\n\r\nEDIT 1:\r\nWorking on it atm . I decided to make the following optimisations but want to very quickly make sure that async checkpointing works the way I believe it does:\r\n- Most importantly, I am changing the iteration head to always forward records. Their effects are not present in any in-progress snapshot anyway so that I should had done from the very beginning. :)\r\n- If `ListState` is checkpointed asynchronously, depending on the backend I suppose, then the current version of it, during the snapshot, will be persisted as a copy, which means that we can reset it (clear and rebuild) right after invoking the snapshot to the beginning of the next in-progress snapshot (some indexing involved). That way we do not need to open new ListStates in the first place. Does this make sense?\r\n\r\n@StephanEwen Please correct me if I am wrong, regarding the second point. I am just not very familiar with async snapshotting for `ListState` (this is not clear in the documentation for me). Mind also that I do not use the `CheckpointedAsychronously` interface, it seems to be heading towards deprecation. Thanks!\r\n\r\nEDIT 2:\r\nOn a second look I had today, the second optimisation cannot be implemented with the append-only `ListState` so I will do it in separate ones as suggested. The first optimisation still holds though.  @StephanEwen I would really appreciate it if you fill me in or point out an example on how to open and maintain multiple versions of a ListState for async checkpointing to make it right. Should I use descriptors with a different name?\r\n\r\n@StephanEwen could you check my question above when you can?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/267585600/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/267587001","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2836#issuecomment-267587001","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2836","id":267587001,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NzU4NzAwMQ==","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-16T12:46:05Z","updated_at":"2016-12-16T12:46:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I

And yes, it requires ruby 2.0 or higher, while the buildbot is on some flavor of 1.9. Perhaps no one cares, but for what it's worth, ruby 1.9 and ruby 2.0 are old enough that they no longer maintained, even for critical security patches.\r\n\r\nI'm planning to continue to invest significant time in improving the docs, so I'd like to get this in, but you're right, having two build environments is suboptimal (and actually we already have two, in a way, since the dockerized build uses ruby 2.0). I'm hoping we can get the buildbot upgraded to something less ancient and then drop the 1.9-based Gemfile. @mxm has filed a ticket to that effect; we'll see.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/267614077/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/267617216","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2958#issuecomment-267617216","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2958","id":267617216,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NzYxNzIxNg==","user":{"login":"twalthr","id":5746567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDY1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5746567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr","html_url":"https://github.com/twalthr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-16T15:22:02Z","updated_at":"2016-12-16T15:22:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I looked over the changes again.

I'll rebase this PR accordingly.\r\n\r\nIt is vital that client code which supports hostname verification use the FQDN of the host to connect.   Akka doesn't support verification so I left the code as-is.  But it is supported by the webui (which is advertised to Yarn and to Mesos), the Mesos artifact URL, the Netty data exchange endpoint, and the blob client/server.   \r\n\r\nI think it is best to use `InetAddress` rather than `String` whenever possible.    The commit associated with FLINK-2821 alludes to issues with resolving the hostname from a container.

It is incorrect to bypass the UGI login methods when in 'SIMPLE' auth mode.\r\n\r\nFor example, Flink uses the `HADOOP_USER_NAME` envvar to pass the client's username from CLI to AppMaster to TaskManager; the HadoopSecurityContext must be used to apply it.    This PR wreaks havoc on scenarios like this.\r\n\r\nI think the root cause in the MapR case is that MapR seems to rely on an [actual JAAS config file](https://community.mapr.com/thread/9240), rather than on stock Hadoop's in-memory JAAS configuration.   The true solution may be to merge the user-supplied JAAS with our in-memory defaults, thus obtaining the `hadoop_simple` entry from `mapr.login.conf`.\r\n\r\nCC @tillrohrmann @vijikarthi
