know that in practical applications, full-link gray scale publishing scenario is very common, and message queue as one of the links should also have this capability, this scheme makes RocketMQ4.x and RocketMQ5.x native support message gray scale publishing function. Compared with existing solutions in the industry, this solution does not require additional shadow Topic/Group. There is also no need to transform grayscale tag/UserProperty, etc. (ps: When the scale of the business is relatively large, the grayscale function is implemented by adding a topic or group. On the one hand, there is a critical problem, that is, when the grayscale verification is switched to prod, messages may be missed for consumption, which is unacceptable. On the other hand, there is the cost issue. Imagine the cost of doubling each topic and group, which cannot be ignored.) The solution uses gray partition to solve the problem of message isolation and switching connection at low cost, and has low intrusion to RocketMQ. Just add a few client configurations and access grayscale policies to allow businesses to seamlessly access RocketMQ grayscale publishing capabilities.

Loop）关闭的异常。这通常意味着底层网络库（Netty）无法正确处理任务队列中的任务，可能是由于线程池已被关闭或者资源不足导致的。以下是对该问题的分析及潜在解决策略，尽管原始的知识参考未直接提供针对此特定异常的解决方案，但我们可以基于常见原因进行推理：\r\n\r\n分析原因：\r\n 资源限制或线程池配置不当：可能是因为系统资源（如CPU、内存）不足，或者Netty的线程池配置不恰当，导致线程被提前终止或拒绝新的任务提交。\r\n\r\n 网络问题或服务端不可达：如果RocketMQ Broker服务端不可达或响应超时，客户端在反复尝试连接时可能会触发此类异常。\r\n\r\n 客户端配置错误：客户端配置可能存在问题，例如心跳机制、连接超时设置不当，导致客户端无法维持与服务端的有效连接。\r\n\r\n 版本兼容性问题：虽然您提到了使用的RocketMQ broker和client版本，但理论上不同版本间可能存在兼容性问题，特别是当服务端与客户端版本跨度较大时。\r\n\r\n解决步骤：\r\n1. 检查系统资源与配置\r\n确认服务器（CentOS）的CPU、内存使用情况，确保资源充足。\r\n检查Netty的线程池配置是否合理，必要时调整io.netty.eventLoopThreads等参数以适应您的环境需求。\r\n2. 网络连通性验证\r\n确保网络畅通无阻，可以通过ping或telnet命令测试与RocketMQ Broker地址（127.0.0.1:9876）的连通性。\r\n查看Broker服务端日志，确认服务端运行正常且没有拒绝连接的记录。\r\n3. 客户端配置审查\r\n重新审视客户端配置文件（如application.properties），确认rocketmq.name-server配置正确，且与服务端实际地址匹配。\r\n调整客户端连接相关的配置项，比如心跳间隔、重试策略等，确保它们符合预期。\r\n4. 版本兼容性验证\r\n尽管直接的版本不兼容不太可能是该异常的直接原因，但可以考虑检查社区是否有相关版本组合下的已知问题，并考虑升级或降级客户端/服务端版本以寻求更稳定的组合。\r\n5. 日志深入分析\r\n开启客户端日志的详细模式，获取更多上下文信息，特别是连接建立、心跳维护等相关日志，有助于进一步定位问题。\r\n结论解释：\r\n以上步骤旨在从系统资源、网络连通性、配置合理性以及软件版本兼容性等方面入手，逐一排查并解决导致客户端连接失败的潜在因素。由于原始知识参考未提供直接的解决方案，上述建议基于通用故障排查逻辑，需要您根据实际情况灵活应用。希望这些步骤能帮助您诊断并解决当前遇到的问题。\r\n\r\n参考链接：\r\n*专家经验：收发消息的例子\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\n如需要更深入学习了解rocketmq

(K8s)集群中运行RocketMQ 4.6.0版本时，Pod重启后因锁文件存在而一致启动失败。尽管您期望在服务停止前能清理锁文件，但实际上并未发生。这里我们没有直接的相关知识段落来精确解答为何重启流程未包含锁文件的清理，但我们可以基于RocketMQ的一般运维知识和K8s的工作原理来分析可能的原因并提供一些建议。\r\n\r\n分析问题原因：\r\n RocketMQ设计：RocketMQ使用锁文件来防止多个实例同时运行在同一数据存储路径下，这是为了保持数据一致性。正常情况下，RocketMQ服务在关闭时应该会自动清理这些锁文件。但若服务异常终止（如被K8s强制杀掉），可能导致常规清理流程未被执行。\r\n\r\n K8s重启流程：Kubernetes在重启Pod时遵循其生命周期管理策略，包括Graceful Shutdown过程，但这个过程依赖于容器内部的应用支持。如果应用没有正确处理SIGTERM信号或在收到该信号后未能完成必要的清理工作，K8s最终会强制终止容器，可能遗留锁文件。\r\n\r\n解决方案建议：\r\n 自定义预停止脚本：在K8s的Pod定义中，您可以利用preStop生命周期钩子来执行自定义脚本，在Pod被终止前清理锁文件。例如，添加以下YAML配置到您的Deployment或StatefulSet中：\r\n\r\nlifecycle:\r\n  preStop:\r\n    exec:\r\n      command: [\"/bin/sh\", \"-c\", \"rm /path/to/your/lockfile\"]\r\n确保替换/path/to/your/lockfile为实际的锁文件路径。\r\n\r\n 优化RocketMQ关闭逻辑：检查RocketMQ配置或自定义RocketMQ启动脚本，确保在接收到终止信号时能够执行完整的清理操作，包括删除锁文件。\r\n\r\n 增强健康检查与恢复策略：在K8s中，确保配置合适的livenessProbe和readinessProbe，以便K8s能够准确判断RocketMQ实例的状态。当检测到不健康状态时，K8s可以尝试重启Pod，但在执行重启前，通过preStop钩子清理锁文件，减少启动失败的可能性。\r\n\r\n额外说明：\r\n确保JDK版本兼容性，虽然问题中未提及具体版本，但使用与RocketMQ 4.6.0兼容的JDK版本也是确保系统稳定性的关键因素之一。\r\n综上所述，通过实施上述建议措施，可以提高RocketMQ在K8s环境中异常重启时的处理能力，避免因锁文件残留导致的启动失败问题。\r\n\r\n参考链接：\r\n*专家经验：org.apache.rocketmq.remoting.exception.RemotingTimeoutException: wait response

I have a question: how will this solution do when we need more than one gray environment?\r\n> \r\n> Like Git branch, we may have several active branches and each of them runs in its independent gray environment.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, thank you very much for your response and for asking the question.\r\n\r\nThis solution also effectively addresses this issue when multiple grayscale environments are required.\r\nIn project development, it is true that there are multiple active branches or environments. For this, the proposed solution is:\r\n1. different environment processing: in different environments (e.g. dev/test/stage/prod), the environment suffix can be added for the same topic or group. This kind of processing has been widely used. For example, the topic name can be topic-{environment}, such as pt-order-completed-stage, and the group name can be GID-open-service-stage.\r\n2. Multiple branches in the same environment: In the same environment (e.g., test environment), there may also exist multiple branch environments, such as test1/test2/test3.\r\nIn conjunction with this scenario, a grayscale partitioning approach can be used during grayscale release in a given environment. This approach ensures that messages sent by grayscale producers are accurately consumed by grayscale consumers, while messages from non-grayscale producers are processed by non-grayscale consumers. In this way, it ensures both grayscale validation of MQ message changes, as well as a friendly solution to the switchover interface from grayscale to the normal environment once the grayscale validation is passed.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn fact, most enterprises want to perform gray-scale validation of MQ messages in a low-cost and convenient way in an all-link gray-scale publishing scenario. However, when MQ does not support grayscale messages, it involves a change in consumption logic, and developers often need to add a lot of compatibility logic to the code. Nonetheless, these logics can only ensure that the new business does not affect the online, but cannot ensure that the grayscale traffic accurately enters the grayscale consumption client, thus preventing strict grayscale validation. With this solution, these problems can be effectively solved.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/2283513528/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/2285104155","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/7175#issuecomment-2285104155","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/7175","id":2285104155,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl86IM-wb","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-13T00:09:22Z","updated_at":"2024-08-13T00:09:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue is stale because it has been open for 365 days with no activity.

While comparing our solutions, I noticed the following differences between this solution and your previous one:\r\n\r\n1.MQ version support: This solution is compatible with RocketMQ 4.x and RocketMQ 5.x.\r\n2. Consumption mode: This program supports POP consumption mode and Push consumption mode.\r\n3. Implementation details: This solution utilizes the clientId generation mechanism. By adding public client configurations, it allows MQ users to decide whether or not to enable grayscale messaging. These configurations allow RocketMQ users to easily determine if a client is a grayscale client.\r\n4.

This PR handles multiple environments poorly, as each environment must be bound to corresponding queues, thereby limiting the number of environments that can be supported.\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your feedback.\r\n\r\n1.**Regarding the startup sequence of gray consumers**: Yes, the PR recommends that gray consumers be started before gray producers to ensure that gray messages are correctly processed.\r\n\r\n2.**Regarding the issue of subscription inconsistency**: This PR does not address scenarios with inconsistent subscriptions, as this issue is not caused by the gray partitioning scheme. Even without the gray scheme, when gray consumers (gray pods) and base consumers (base pods) have different subscription relationships, the same problem will occur. However, the issue of inconsistent subscriptions can be resolved through other means.\r\n\r\n3.**Regarding rewrite load balancing rules and select message queue function**: The Remoting Protocol client can indeed have its logic rewritten. Apologies, I haven't yet found the entry point for this. However, to ensure compatibility with RocketMQ 5.x server-side load balancing and to support both Pop and Push consumption modes, the PR introduces additional client configurations, providing a simple and flexible way to integrate the gray feature.\r\n\r\n4.**Multi-environment and gray release**: The gray partitioning scheme and binding of different environments to corresponding queues do not conflict; rather, they complement each other. This design ensures that each environment can carry out gray releases in an orderly and independent manner.\r\n\r\n**Additional Notes**:\r\nAbout multiple environments and gray-scale releases\r\nIn the daily development process, we usually divide multiple environments, such as dev, test, stage, prod and so on. In the test environment, due to different project branches, it may be further subdivided into testA, testB, testC and other sub-environments. Based on the actual needs, we can choose to create a separate topic/group with the “environment” logo for a specific environment, so as to realize multi-environment MQ message isolation, which is more common in practice.\r\nHowever, when we do a gray-scale release for a certain environment (e.g., prod environment), if we create additional shadow topics/groups for the purpose of gray-scale functionality, this may cause some problems. First, the criticality issue: when the grayscale validation passes and switches to the prod environment (e.g., the pod of the grayscale service is taken offline normally), the grayscale messages may be consumed underconsumed, which is unacceptable. Second, the cost issue: doubling each topic and group in order to implement the grayscale functionality brings significant cost overhead.\r\nFor multiple environments, complete isolation by adding new topics/groups combined with the ability to partition grayscale during grayscale for specific environments (e.g., online environments) are not conflicting and are complementary. The combination of the two approaches is designed to ensure that each environment can be grayed out in an orderly and independent manner.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/2290920186/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
