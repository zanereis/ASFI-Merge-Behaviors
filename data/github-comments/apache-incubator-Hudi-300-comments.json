sorry for the late reply, I have update the impact.\r\n For clustering job, I think there two main functions\r\n- optimize data layout by merge file size to target file size\r\n- optimize data layout by sort\r\n\r\nAnd if I use upsert, I will auto solve small file quesion when tag, the file size will bigger than `hoodie.clustering.plan.strategy.small.file.limit`.  \r\nNow, I want to optimize data layout to make `col stat` more efficiency, and do not change the default file size. Only want to sort data with specified field. But the fille will all be filted by `hoodie.clustering.plan.strategy.small.file.limit`, and can not optimize data by sort, unless set the conf more bigger than max file size to make sure all file will be include. I think this conf is only used to achieve the function `merge small file to bigger`.\r\n\r\nConsidering this strategy : `SparkSingleFileSortExecutionStrategy`, it is only support `optimize data layout by sort` function, I think should not be limited by `hoodie.clustering.plan.strategy.small.file.limit`.

Thanks for the contribution @KevinyhZou , somehow i feel the PR is valuable and we can generalize it to all the writer cases: append mode, upsert, and we can move the partition check done file writing

The watermark timestamp can be reported through the `WriteMetadataEvent`.\r\n> \r\n> And another concern is: the watermark is already a timestamp and do we have a need for different kind of timestamp formatter ?\r\n\r\nOK, i will consider this.  The timestamp formatter is introduced as adapt to flink 1.15 version,  and I will think about that if we can use a default formatter for it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1316481131/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1316574433","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/7214#issuecomment-1316574433","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/7214","id":1316574433,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5OeVTh","user":{"login":"hudi-bot","id":79415918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDE1OTE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79415918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/hudi-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-16T08:18:38Z","updated_at":"2022-11-16T08:18:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\nMeta data\n{\n  \"version\" : 1,\n  \"metaDataEntries\" : [ {\n    \"hash\" : \"8b86391f7e05a9443023800a776f01ea6eb807a8\",\n    \"status\" : \"SUCCESS\",\n    \"url\" : \"https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=13046\",\n    \"triggerID\" : \"8b86391f7e05a9443023800a776f01ea6eb807a8\",\n    \"triggerType\" : \"PUSH\"\n  } ]\n}-->\n## CI report:\n\n* 8b86391f7e05a9443023800a776f01ea6eb807a8 Azure: [SUCCESS](https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=13046) \n\n<details>\n<summary>Bot commands</summary>\n  @hudi-bot supports the following commands:\n\n -

we only do 1 for all kinds of input formats, and wrap another format only for schema evolution by doing step2, WDYT ?\r\n\r\nYes it sounds reasonable. Moreover, I've already tried it:) and faced with one problem. Mb you know how to solve it. When SE enabled we can't  do the first step \"read the record as is\" because `int[] selectedFields` is based on latest read schema (aka querySchema) not on file schema (aka actualSchema). So we need additional `step 0`\r\n\r\n0. Prepare `int[] selectedFields` according to actual schema (if SE enabled)\r\n1. fetch the original schema when the file was committed, read the record as is\r\n2. project the record with latest read schema if needed (if SE enabled)\r\n\r\nSo \"wrap another format\" looks likes:\r\n```java\r\nInputFormat inputFormat;\r\nif (SE.enabled) {\r\n  inputFormat = new ProjectFormat(new ReadAsIsFormat(new PrepareFormat()))\r\n} else {\r\n  inputFormat = new ReadAsIsFormat()\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI mean, this is a solvable problem, but the solution is more complicated than this PR. On the other hand, I totally agree that we need to think in the direction you proposed on code

Some high level thoughts:\r\n> \r\n> * **hudi commit metadata vs hudi metrics**: if users enable diagnostic reporter, should we have a config to include metrics reporter's data? metrics system is good at showing the trends but hard to cross-check against commit metadata. so regardless of enabling metrics reporter or not, diagnostic reporter can collect metrics and save to report dir, just like a csv/json metrics reporter. We can also refine what goes to metrics and what goes to commit metadata, to keep the responsibilities clear and reporting data organized.\r\n> * **consolidate with error table**: [RFC-20](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/HUDI/RFC+-+20+%3A+handle+failed+records) this is a long-pending feature that also aims to assist investigation. diagnostic reporter should be aware of error table settings and zip the error table if configured so. Size could be a concern, so configuration can be given to zip the whole table, or sample records, or skip error table completely. Also it requires some config to allow masking any fields. Taking a step further, we can also make error table one of the diagnostic reporting features. They have similar storage structures: can be local to the hudi table or global to the whole platform.\r\n> * **work with metadata table**: you've already mentioned collecting stats by listing the file system. diagnostic reporter should also be aware of the presence of metadata table and zip the table or extract relevant data - fallback to file system listing if not present.\r\n\r\nThanks @xushiyan for your advice!\r\nWill have a deep look and expand this rfc asap!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1318166797/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1318207035","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/6406#issuecomment-1318207035","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/6406","id":1318207035,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5Okj47","user":{"login":"danny0405","id":7644508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NDQ1MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7644508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405","html_url":"https://github.com/danny0405","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-17T07:33:07Z","updated_at":"2022-11-17T07:33:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"No, it is useless actually.
