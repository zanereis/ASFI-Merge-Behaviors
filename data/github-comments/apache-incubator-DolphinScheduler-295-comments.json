ShellCommandExecutor is shared across different task plugins, it might not be a good practice and uneasy to maintain if we need to change it every time we need to mask something for a task plugin. The same for line 55-56.\r\n\r\nHi, @EricGao888. Thanks for your suggestions. I have moved the masking logic to a common util class.\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nThere are 2 possible locations that the log may contain the sensitive data (e.g., password). Taking the sqoop task as an example:\r\n\r\n1. The log output in the `buildCommand()` in `SqoopTask`. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/blob/28469fc9b23094a74cbef83b9990d6fbced20d79/dolphinscheduler-task-plugin/dolphinscheduler-task-sqoop/src/main/java/org/apache/dolphinscheduler/plugin/task/sqoop/SqoopTask.java#L82-L84\r\n\r\n2. The log output in the `createCommandFileIfNotExists(String execCommand, String commandFile)` in `ShellCommandExecutor`. We need to mask the sensitive data of `execCommand` here since the `execCommand` will be output in the log. But this class is shared by multiple task plugins and how to mask the sensitive data needs to be discussed.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/blob/17a9dd25fa0e80b048394f79db130f56eb8ef72f/dolphinscheduler-task-plugin/dolphinscheduler-task-api/src/main/java/org/apache/dolphinscheduler/plugin/task/api/ShellCommandExecutor.java#L115-L116\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs for me, there are 2 ways:\r\n\r\n### **1. Mask the sensitive data at the point of outputting the task log and every task plugin applys the same masking logic**\r\n\r\n* Encapsulate the `logger` of `AbstractTaskExecutor`. Every time the task log is output, the output statement will be matched to see if there is any sensitive data.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/blob/ebcffb04aad9db8ec6df1105e4770b187088e701/dolphinscheduler-task-plugin/dolphinscheduler-task-api/src/main/java/org/apache/dolphinscheduler/plugin/task/api/AbstractTaskExecutor.java#L37\r\n\r\n* By default, common sensitive data will be matched, and users can customize the sensitive information that needs to be masked.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"619\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38122586/188794873-0196158f-ebfc-4398-835a-f2ecca19cfef.png\">\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38122586/188795058-f19fb1fc-587d-404c-b7e3-c93ed7c14228.png)\r\n\r\nNote that the command after masking will only used to output in the log, so this method **will not affect the actual command executed.**\r\n\r\n\r\nReference: [Sensitive data masking of Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/security/secrets/mask-sensitive-values.html)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### **2. Each task plugin implements its own masking logic**\r\n\r\nRefactor the `createCommandFileIfNotExists()` and add a param `String execCommandMasking`.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/blob/28469fc9b23094a74cbef83b9990d6fbced20d79/dolphinscheduler-task-plugin/dolphinscheduler-task-api/src/main/java/org/apache/dolphinscheduler/plugin/task/api/ShellCommandExecutor.java#L84-L87\r\n\r\nAlso `AbstractCommandExecutor.run(execCommand)` needs to be refactored to `AbstractCommandExecutor.run(execCommand, execCommandMasking)`.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/blob/28469fc9b23094a74cbef83b9990d6fbced20d79/dolphinscheduler-task-plugin/dolphinscheduler-task-api/src/main/java/org/apache/dolphinscheduler/plugin/task/api/AbstractCommandExecutor.java#L176\r\n\r\nBy doing this, the process logic of how to mask the sensitive data can be done in each task plugin. But this will modify `AbstractCommandExecutor` and `ShellCommandExecutor`, and many task plugins need to be modified and implement their own masking logic.\r\n\r\nBelow is the list of affected classes:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"365\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38122586/188796830-43a25252-f2b9-498d-9407-9712a9317ae6.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\nI personally prefer the first way to mask the sensitive data. And I also sent a related discussion email to the mailing list.\r\n\r\nSo which way do you think is better? Or there are other better ways to do so.\r\nAny comments or suggestions are welcome!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1236633109/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1236682556","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/pull/11668#issuecomment-1236682556","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/11668","id":1236682556,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms5Jtkc8","user":{"login":"davidzollo","id":15833811,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODMzODEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15833811?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidzollo","html_url":"https://github.com/davidzollo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidzollo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidzollo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidzollo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidzollo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidzollo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidzollo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidzollo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidzollo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidzollo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-05T08:18:13Z","updated_at":"2022-09-05T08:18:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ruanwenjun
