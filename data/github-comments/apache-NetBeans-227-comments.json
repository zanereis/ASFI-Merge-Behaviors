The problem is, that FileZilla forces clients to reuse the TLS session used for the control channel on the data channel. Seems, that problem wracks havoc with various clients and my TL;DR take away is: FTP is dead, don't use it.\r\n> \r\n> The longer version: Java implements session resumptions for TLS. However it only allows that only for the same hostname/port pair. The TLS sessions are held in a map keyed by this. But even breaking into the JDK code and faking an entry holding the same session for hostname/datachannel-port as for hostname/controlchannel-port does not help (Idea from https://gist.github.com/riyaz-ali/48fb486f51c258b4e92c2d2be30c35c4, adjusted as `getHost` does not work anymore).\r\n> \r\n> Messing with TLS settings also did not help on my test setup (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NET-408).\r\n> \r\n> My final straw was adding bouncy-castle TLS to NetBeans and using its implementation for the connection (inspired by [bcgit/bc-java#458](https://github.com/bcgit/bc-java/issues/458)). Wireshark indicated, that the session was established, the client side disagreed and still did not work.\r\n> \r\n> I stop at this point.\r\n\r\nWe had to connect to such a filezilla FTP server once too and our team succeeded in providing a solution.

thanks for the test. Yeah, you hit a different limitation than I did. The problem is the construct in the second line of the regexp:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(?x)\r\n  (?<=\\S\\s*)\r\n  (\\/\\/\\s*)\r\n  (\r\n    \\[(?:\r\n        (?:-?\\d+(?:.\\d)*)(?:\\s*:\\s*-?\\d+(?:.\\d)*){0,2} |\r\n        (?:(?:[^:,]+:)?[^:,]+,)*(?:(?:[^:,]+:)?[^:,]+)\r\n      )\r\n    \\]\r\n  )\r\n  [ \\t]*$\\n?\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt has an unlimited length, which is not yet supported by joni. Oniguruma added support for it in 2020, but it seems, that noone ported that. \r\n\r\nThe grammar can be trivially be fixed. Change line 33 to:\r\n\r\n```\r\n      \"match\": \"(?x)\\n (\\\\/\\\\/\\\\s*)\\n  (\\n    \\\\[(?:\\n        (?:-?\\\\d+(?:.\\\\d)*)(?:\\\\s*:\\\\s*-?\\\\d+(?:.\\\\d)*){0,2} |\\n        (?:(?:[^:,]+:)?[^:,]+,)*(?:(?:[^:,]+:)?[^:,]+)\\n      )\\n    \\\\]\\n  )\\n  [ \\\\t]*$\\\\n?\",\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd you should be good. At this point NetBeans does not use the extractacted values and the look-behind only ensures, that this match requires a variable before it. For the coloring it does not matter.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2483931585/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2483964666","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/7970#issuecomment-2483964666","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7970","id":2483964666,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6UDkr6","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-18T19:49:01Z","updated_at":"2024-11-18T19:49:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mbien
