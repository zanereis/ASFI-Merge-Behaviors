In #8 we introduced transactors which advertise their oldest active snapshot on ZK.   Fluo-gc uses this info ZK to determine whats safe to collect.  The advertisements are done using Curator PersistentEphemeralNodes.  These nodes may vanish for short periods of time, which means there is a small chance that GC may collect something that is should not.   Thats ok now with the truncation markers, because those prevent scans reading past a point of garbage collection.  However this would not be ok if truncation markers were dropped and a scan read past a GC point and conclude nothing is there.\n\nTo solve this problem, I am thinking of dropping truncation markers and making the Oracle an authority on GC times.  In what I am thinking, the Oracle would do the following :\n-  Periodically Read the oldest active snapshot time from ZK, hold it in memory, and write out a GC time ZK.\n- When clients request timestamps, also return the GC time (its held in memory from the last update).\n\nClients would use the GC time returned by the oracle when committing or closing a snapshot.  That might look like the following.\n- client gets start timestamp timeA for tx1 from oracle\n- client gets commit timestamp timeB and gc time timeG from oracle for tx1\n- client checkts that timeA > timeG, if not it throws an exception and rolls back phase 1 of commit\n\nThe Fluo GC iterator would be changed to read the GC time written to ZK by the Oracle.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/143206603/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/144821003","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fluo/pull/560#issuecomment-144821003","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/560","id":144821003,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NDgyMTAwMw==","user":{"login":"mikewalch","id":730698,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMDY5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/730698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch","html_url":"https://github.com/mikewalch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-01T19:15:47Z","updated_at":"2015-10-01T19:15:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"+1\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/144821003/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/144821124","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fluo/pull/561#issuecomment-144821124","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/561","id":144821124,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NDgyMTEyNA==","user":{"login":"mikewalch","id":730698,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMDY5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/730698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch","html_url":"https://github.com/mikewalch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-01T19:16:19Z","updated_at":"2015-10-01T19:16:19Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"+1\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/144821124/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/149235905","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fluo/pull/563#issuecomment-149235905","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/563","id":149235905,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0OTIzNTkwNQ==","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-19T14:42:23Z","updated_at":"2015-10-19T14:42:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I

Mainly in the case where it failed previously, but did complete part of the 2nd phase of commit.   In this case it may not recreate the notifications it created last time and those notifications will never be created until something tries to read the locked data (which may never happen).\n\nSince the solution in #456 was based on an incorrect premise I may be able to delete the notifications earlier as was done before the \"fix\" for #456 in addition to setting notifications in the lock phase.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/209019583/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/209049105","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fluo/issues/642#issuecomment-209049105","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/642","id":209049105,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwOTA0OTEwNQ==","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-12T18:45:12Z","updated_at":"2016-04-12T19:04:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thinking about this, if setting notifications during 1st phase of commit then would use start timestamp.

Weak notifications are written after all locks are written, but before finishing the commit on the primary column.  In the case of failures the transactions will be rolled back and all notifications rewitten.  For strong notifications, need to ensure observers fail when triggered by a notification written for a transaction that fails.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/209129473/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/209986630","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fluo/pull/645#issuecomment-209986630","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/645","id":209986630,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwOTk4NjYzMA==","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-14T14:58:25Z","updated_at":"2016-04-14T14:58:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"With these change, I was able to successfully run stress test locally while continually stopping and starting fluo with a script.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/209986630/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/213630145","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fluo/issues/593#issuecomment-213630145","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/593","id":213630145,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMzYzMDE0NQ==","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-22T23:58:53Z","updated_at":"2016-04-22T23:58:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I implemented async commit.  With async commit changes I am seeing much improved processing rates and much higher resource utilization on the cluster.  I ran webindex on a 20 node EC2 cluster and saw the following.  Previously with a similar setup I saw a peak of processing around 1000 web pages per second.  In the test below I loaded 80 common crawl files in two batches of 40.\n\n![tx_per_sec](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1268739/14757527/c6bd1586-08c2-11e6-9347-8a1b2eab189d.png)\n\nI set the cluster to have 100M of commit memory.

The [Fluo project pom](https://github.com/fluo-io/resources/blob/613cf66b7894e9f376b6263a4a6ced8326e3e8dc/pom.xml) provides common functionality across Fluo project poms ([Fluo pom](https://github.com/apache/incubator-fluo/blob/fee0ca74d04aad8d0dc599817ac5deca19f92c44/pom.xml) and [Recipes pom](https://github.com/apache/incubator-fluo-recipes/blob/93f482aa447e5f63c3e3406f05e328404ac143ba/pom.xml)).  For example the Fluo parent pom sets up code formatting, findbugs, etc.  Therefore each project pom does not have to duplicate all of this.  The projects poms [used to duplicate](https://github.com/apache/incubator-fluo/commit/2911b373357ee87c99e019475f3ade13c499205b#diff-600376dffeb79835ede4a0b285078036) all of this before creating the Fluo project pom.\n\nNow that we are moving to Apache we want to use config from the [Apache pom](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/apache/18/apache-18.pom) to do releases.   We also want to keep things from the  [Fluo Project pom](https://github.com/fluo-io/resources/blob/613cf66b7894e9f376b6263a4a6ced8326e3e8dc/pom.xml) like code formatting.  To accomplish this we can add the Apache as a parent of the Fluo project pom.\n\nAlso we need to remove the current info about releasing to Sonatype (where io.flou releases were done) from any of the poms where it may occur.\n\nThe following is the high level overview of what I think needs to be done.\n1. Add [Apache pom](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/apache/18/apache-18.pom) as parent of [Fluo project pom](https://github.com/fluo-io/resources/blob/613cf66b7894e9f376b6263a4a6ced8326e3e8dc/pom.xml)\n2. Reconcile plugin config that occur in both poms.  Feel free to ask about reconciling any duplicate plugins with different config.\n3. Remove Sonatype distribution management section from Fluo project pom.  Look for other Sonatye stuff to remove. (should inherit distribution management from Apache parent pom)\n4. Release new version of Fluo project pom\n5. Update [Fluo pom](https://github.com/apache/incubator-fluo/blob/fee0ca74d04aad8d0dc599817ac5deca19f92c44/pom.xml) and [Recipes pom](https://github.com/apache/incubator-fluo-recipes/blob/93f482aa447e5f63c3e3406f05e328404ac143ba/pom.xml) to use new version of Fluo project pom.\n\nWe were planning on releasing the Fluo project pom to Sonatype because we have not transitioned that project to Apache yet.   @ctubbsii  how can the Fluo project pom release to Sonatype if it drops Sonatype distribution management and inherits Apache distribution management?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/229363678/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/229368588","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fluo/issues/688#issuecomment-229368588","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/688","id":229368588,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyOTM2ODU4OA==","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-29T14:13:39Z","updated_at":"2016-06-29T14:13:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"An alternative to modifiying the existing  [Fluo project pom][1] is to create a new parent for Fluo and Fluo Recipes.
