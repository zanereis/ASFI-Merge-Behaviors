People have been asking about things like bringing your own requirements, etc. I would also caution that the tests themselves need to be updated a bit in order to lessen, or remove completely, their reliance on the Superset examples. The reason why I bring this up here is that speed and ease of running tests is paramount, and forcing a \"real\" DB into the mix will definitely affect performance over the current SQLite setup.\r\n\r\nAs we all have skin in this game, our end goal is to make things as streamlined and approachable as possible. Anything that gets in the way or adds too much complexity should be carefully considered. Having said that, I think this will end up being a collaborative effort and will likely take some time to get \"right\".","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/567978178/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/568003773","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/8346#issuecomment-568003773","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/8346","id":568003773,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2ODAwMzc3Mw==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-20T17:08:31Z","updated_at":"2019-12-20T17:08:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity.
