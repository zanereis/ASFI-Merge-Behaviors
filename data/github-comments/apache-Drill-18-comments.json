\r\n1. Renamed PR as you suggested to better convey changes idea. Thank you for suggestion.\r\n2. Included row count into batch size determination.  Thus batch size will be limited to max allowed rows (as before if memory limit does not exceed) or to number of records that are within max allowed memory limit.\r\n3. Unfortunately did not add unit tests, Not sure if there is a way to test Hbase reader in isolation for true unit testing (I know you have been working to some changes in this area but I don't know the details).\r\nBut I have tested the fix manually, changing in code max rows size and memory allocation. Could not write Drill \"unit tests\" for this since it's not easy to mock `static final int fields` and adding such large data sets to test on real numbers may extend our unit tests running time. I guess in this case it's better to add such test to Functional tests suite. So if possible let's leave this change without unit tests for now.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/302467780/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/302477009","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/839#issuecomment-302477009","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/839","id":302477009,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMjQ3NzAwOQ==","user":{"login":"sudheeshkatkam","id":3272600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNzI2MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3272600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam","html_url":"https://github.com/sudheeshkatkam","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-18T17:10:55Z","updated_at":"2017-05-18T17:10:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/302477009/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/302478552","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/833#issuecomment-302478552","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/833","id":302478552,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMjQ3ODU1Mg==","user":{"login":"sudheeshkatkam","id":3272600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNzI2MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3272600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam","html_url":"https://github.com/sudheeshkatkam","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-18T17:14:44Z","updated_at":"2017-05-18T17:14:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Could
