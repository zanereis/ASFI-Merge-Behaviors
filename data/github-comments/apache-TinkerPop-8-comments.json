quoted the javadoc there and that's precisely my point about something looking wrong.  If my interpretation of that javadoc and the java source code is correct, `awaitTermination` is returning false after blocking (due to timeout), and you are just sleeping the thread for 30 seconds. which is plenty of time for that work to finish. then you call a hard `shutdownNow` which has no effect really because there are no more tasks executed. `awaitTermintation` requires a call to `shutdown` somewhere for it to ever return true (success).\n\nif this was a problem for appveyor I suggest you update your branch with the latest changes which should have fixed the problems we were

Users who previously used the profile()-Step in conjunction with cap(TraversalMetrics.METRICS_KEY) can now simply omit the cap step. Users who retrieved TraverseralMetrics from the side effects after iteration can still do so, but will need to specify a side effect key when using the profile()-Step.\n\nCHANGELOG\nSplit existing profile()-Step into ProfileStep and ProfileSideEffectStep. profile()-Step now emits TraversalMetrics without the need for cap()-Step.\n\n3 I'm guessing this is outside the coverage of the tests?

the `ServiceLoader` is a bigger change than it immediately appears.  The `ServiceLoader` provides functionality that allows the console to show the user the list of plugins that are present but not \"activated\":\n\n``` text\ngremlin> :plugin list\n==>tinkerpop.server[active]\n==>tinkerpop.gephi\n==>tinkerpop.utilities[active]\n==>tinkerpop.sugar\n==>tinkerpop.credentials\n==>tinkerpop.tinkergraph[active]\n```\n\nWith this change in place you get:\n\n``` text\ngremlin> :plugin list\n==>tinkerpop.server[active]\n==>tinkerpop.utilities[active]\n==>tinkerpop.tinkergraph[active]\n```\n\nOf course, as we are learning, the notion of \"active\" is somewhat blurry because an \"inactive\" plugin may still load some aspect of a class during instantiation by `ServiceLoader`.  An \"inactive\" plugin is really one that doesn't have its plugin methods called to perform imports, init the console environment, etc.\n\nI guess the question is whether or not its valuable to know what plugins are available but not active. If it was determined that we could just drop that capability, there'd be some additional code/docs to amend to this PR. If we wanted to try to keep this functionality, i guess a custom `ServiceLoader` could work - it would just need to do the same thing as the current `ServiceLoader` but not throw an exception if a class could not be found - though that would have its own dangers in some sense.  \n\n@bdeggleston do you see any other ways to implement this without losing the functionality of listing available plugins as it works now?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/190690137/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/190710339","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/195#issuecomment-190710339","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/195","id":190710339,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MDcxMDMzOQ==","user":{"login":"rjbriody","id":492786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mjc4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/492786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjbriody","html_url":"https://github.com/rjbriody","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjbriody/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjbriody/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjbriody/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjbriody/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjbriody/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjbriody/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjbriody/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjbriody/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjbriody/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-01T12:50:27Z","updated_at":"2016-03-01T12:50:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@okram make sure you merge https://github.com/apache/incubator-tinkerpop/pull/242 before this one, as it will be easier to deal w/ conflicts in this PR (if there are any).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/190710339/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/190713524","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/242#issuecomment-190713524","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/242","id":190713524,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MDcxMzUyNA==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-01T12:57:22Z","updated_at":"2016-03-01T12:57:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"i don't see any changes to docs here.

Instead of modifying the constructor, can you please just add a new one and keep the old one? That way we don't break anyone's code. If the users chooses to not supply `GraphManager` you can just instantiate from `Settings`.\n\nLet's see what it looks like from that perspective.

I'll do the rebase asap. I got two questions regarding your implementation advice. \n\nThe first:\nWhen I got you right, you want me to remove the parameter from the \"old\" constructor and create a new one with the GraphManager as parameter, right? What I do not get is: When I create a new constructor with the GraphManager as parameter, leaving the old one as it is, how should I influence the \"bootstrap\" process given in the old constructor? Setting the member before calling the other constructor does not work by design and duplicating all the code seems no good option to me. Can you point me in the right direction?\n\nThe second:\nThe intention behind the PR was - at least from my point of view - exactly what you described. I wanted the original signature of the constructor behave the same way as before.

The assert used to verify that the duration was greater than the total sleep time AND less than whatever that was + 10ms. That was totally unreliable even after we jacked the tolerance so I just got rid of all the upper bound checking.
