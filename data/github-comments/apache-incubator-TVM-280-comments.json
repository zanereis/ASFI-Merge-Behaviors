I agree to have attributes on the `IRModule` level, so that we could add some metadata and guide the compiler behavior. It is consistent with the direction we are moving towards as a unified IR.\r\n\r\n<del>However, I have some concerns on whether we should remove `BaseFunc`-level annotations. </del> Sorry I misread! I thought \"BaseFuncs to be able to remove it\" means removing attributes in `BaseFunc`, but it turns out to refer to other things :-)\r\n\r\nOne thing, which I understand it is not introduced by this PR (so no action needed in this PR :-) ), but would love to discuss a little bit if this design is the direction we want to move forward or move away from: I am not so sure about `DictAttrs` itself. From my PoV it is basically equivalent to `Map<String, ObjectRef>`, but more ad-hoc in terms of unnecessary access control and accessor patterns. As an example, recently, we refactored the ForNode in TIR with the `Map<String, ObjectRef>` as loop annotation instead of `DictAttrs`. \r\n\r\nBTW, just a readability question: shall we move `GetAttr`/`HasNonZeroAttr` back to the `BaseFunc`/`IRModule` themselves? This could sort of reduce one level of indirection when using these objects which are considered to be objects that \"come with attributes\" :-) We may either duplicate the code, and if we don't like duplication, it is doable via either defining a commonly used utility function, or CRTP:\r\n\r\n```C++\r\ntemplate <class TAttrObject>\r\nstruct AttrObject {\r\n  GetAttr(...) const { \r\n    const DictAttrs& attrs = static_cast<const TAttrObject*>(this)->get()->attrs;\r\n    ....\r\n  }\r\n  HasNonZeroAttr(...) ...\r\n};\r\n\r\nclass IRModule : public runtime::Object, public AttrObject<IRModule> {\r\n  ...\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what you think :-)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/898820399/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/898823984","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8742#issuecomment-898823984","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8742","id":898823984,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM41kvcw","user":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-14T05:11:57Z","updated_at":"2021-08-14T05:11:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The PR itself looks pretty good, and there is no conflict between this one and #8725 which requires much greater effort, so @jroesch would you elaborate why we need to block this PR?

Thanks a lot!\r\n\r\nI have found these two test cases will be fail with my patch all the time, after some investigation I found it isn't easy to fix, it will involve at least 2 PR #7083, PR #8426. The implementation of these 2 test cases depends on #7083, and the implementation of #7083 involve lots of integer implicit conversion between \"uint64\" and \"int32\".\r\n\r\nIn short, we need the authors(@jwfromm) of the test cases to confirm whether the golden is correct, and this maybe need the authors(@tkonolige) of PR #7083 to confirm whether the previous integer implicit conversion logic is what they expected firstly.\r\n\r\nLet me explain it more detail\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/3e0c461f26b5174759dbb932986006f73a94a816/python/tvm/topi/random/kernel.py#L264-L268\r\nFor the line 266 code, the type of the expression `tir.const(2 ** 64 - 1, dtype=gen.dtype) - out_len` is something like `uint64 - int32`, this subtraction will call function `BinaryOpMatchTypes` to do the integer implicit conversion, then the expression will be changed to something like `int64(uint64) - int64(int32)`, (this logic is consistent before and after the PR #8706, so we can ignore the changes made by PR #8706 for easier analysis).\r\n\r\nSo @tkonolige please help to check whether this conversion logic is what you expected(in my opinion, it is wrong for converting tir.const(2**64 - 1, dtype=\"uint64) to \"int64\", this will make your number to a negative number). If it is wrong, then it prove that the implementation of PR #7083 maybe can't work because of the original integer implicit conversion logic, and the golden of these test cases maybe wrong.\r\n\r\nI found the integer implicit conversion is very important for the implementation of PR #7083, so we should investigate it in more details and discuss whether the C standard integer implicit conversion can meet all our requirements or not.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/899441624/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/899472483","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8744#issuecomment-899472483","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8744","id":899472483,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM41nNxj","user":{"login":"Mousius","id":4933431,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MzM0MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4933431?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius","html_url":"https://github.com/Mousius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-16T12:31:41Z","updated_at":"2021-08-16T12:31:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi @areusch, we could use Zephyr to wrap this up but I think it makes sense in this case to match this closely to the existing AOT test utils rather than introducing the dependency on Zephyr and generating a Zephyr project to drive via `west`.

@tqchen Thanks for the feedback.\r\n\r\nTo me, it makes more sense that `GetAttr` is a method on `DictAttrs`. When it's a standalone method on functions and modules, it's not clear what the attributes that GetAttr is accessing actually are. \r\n\r\nAlso, it'll still show up as a method on `DictAttrs` within the FunctionNode, so people will still be able to see it. \r\n\r\nOne possibility is to add `GetAttr`back as a method on `BaseFunc` and `IRModule`, but have that method just call `DictAttr`'s `GetAttr` method. What do you think about that?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/899679386/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/899680793","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8750#issuecomment-899680793","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8750","id":899680793,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM41oAoZ","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-16T17:20:11Z","updated_at":"2021-08-16T17:23:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks @electriclilies \"One possibility is to add GetAttrback as a method on BaseFunc and IRModule, but have that method just call DictAttr's GetAttr method.\" is exactly what I meant by \"keep a common impl as well and redirect in the function and module case\".\r\n\r\nI get your take on the need of a standalone common method, which in some sense can be seen as a tradeoff in the C0 listed above.

If we use `Map<String, ObjectRef>` as the attributes' type, the same method is still valid with proper template programming.\r\n\r\nWhat about this? If an object has an `attrs` field whose type is `DictAttrs`, then we require the object to be consistent with a C++ concept that:\r\n- works with `WithAttr`\r\n- has the method `GetAttr` (with proper type signature)\r\n- has the method `HasNonzeroAttr` (with proper type signature)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/899848131/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/899883668","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8761#issuecomment-899883668","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8761","id":899883668,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM41oyKU","user":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-16T23:29:47Z","updated_at":"2021-08-16T23:29:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The flaky test in auto scheduler is fixed by #8754","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/899883668/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/899884709","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8761#issuecomment-899884709","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8761","id":899884709,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM41oyal","user":{"login":"gromero","id":3375505,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzU1MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3375505?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero","html_url":"https://github.com/gromero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-16T23:33:07Z","updated_at":"2021-08-16T23:33:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@areusch Hi.

The run must crash with:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[...]\r\nINFO:__main__:b'/tmp/x20/qemu-hack/qemu-system-arm -cpu cortex-m33 -machine mps2-an521 -nographic -m 16 -vga none -net none -pidfile qemu.pid -chardev pipe,id=con,mux=on,path=/tmp/tmpq4aigpet/fifo -serial chardev:con -mon chardev=con,mode=readline -icount shift=7,align=off,sleep=off -rtc clock=vm -kernel /tmp/x20/build/zephyr/zephyr.elf\\n'\r\nqemu-system-arm: warning: nic lan9118.0 has no peer\r\n[02:19:49] /home/gromero/git/tvm/src/runtime/micro/micro_session.cc:367: remote: microTVM Zephyr runtime - running\r\nB\r\nINFO:__main__:b\"make[3]: Leaving directory '/tmp/x20/build'\\n\"\r\nINFO:__main__:b'[100%] Built target run\\n'\r\nINFO:__main__:b\"make[2]: Leaving directory '/tmp/x20/build'\\n\"\r\nINFO:__main__:b'/usr/bin/cmake -E cmake_progress_start /tmp/x20/build/CMakeFiles 0\\n'\r\nINFO:__main__:b\"make[1]: Leaving directory '/tmp/x20/build'\\n\"\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/home/gromero/git/tvm/8728/./an.py\", line 38, in <module>\r\n    syslib = session.get_system_lib()\r\n  File \"/home/gromero/git/tvm/python/tvm/micro/session.py\", line 88, in get_system_lib\r\n    return self._rpc.get_function(\"runtime.SystemLib\")()\r\n  File \"/home/gromero/git/tvm/python/tvm/rpc/client.py\", line 73, in get_function\r\n    return self._sess.get_function(name)\r\n  File \"/home/gromero/git/tvm/python/tvm/runtime/module.py\", line 85, in get_function\r\n    check_call(\r\n  File \"/home/gromero/git/tvm/python/tvm/_ffi/base.py\", line 348, in check_call\r\n    raise get_last_ffi_error()\r\ntvm._ffi.base.TVMError: MicroSessionTimeoutError: failed to read reply message after timeout 5s\r\nFAIL\r\n```\r\nWhich points  to the timeout happening at https://github.com/gromero/tvm/blob/8728/8728/an.py#L38 , i.e. just after the handshake as you mentioned I believe.  So I don't believe it's related to the model itself. I'm also with that hypothesis in mind that you raised about something fishy in mps2_an521 drivers ... But can't make sense of it yet.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/899951536/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/899961433","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8716#issuecomment-899961433","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8716","id":899961433,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM41pFJZ","user":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-17T03:14:45Z","updated_at":"2021-08-17T03:14:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@junrushao1994 This PR has been updated.
