It is a little vague of what that means and how generally useful it is. I've seen it discussed in contexts of other caches, but it was never requested for Guava's.\n\nNamespaces used to be asked for a lot back in memcached's heyday. Most of the time it was to invalidate a bunch of keys together which were inter-related. The solution was to use [generational caching](http://www.regexprn.com/2011/06/web-application-caching-strategies_05.html) (a version number as part of the key) and increment the generation when the data store was updated. That relied on the cache to lazily evict the old keys which wouldn't be used anymore.\n\nAlternatively you could build indexes and rely on locking since this is part of the same process. A `CacheWriter` could be useful to make insertion / eviction atomic with a separate multimap (namespace to keys).\n\nIf namespaces are to make regions to have sub and global thresholds, this is even messier. That's usually to share a cluster of memcached and perform resource accounting (e.g. Google's internal rewrite did this) or have an automatic cache sizing. The former makes no sense here, the latter is very messy in Java where GC masks sizes. Attempts to do it automatically (soft references, heap monitoring, etc) don't work well. Its better to be explicit and move large scale caching outside of the JVM (off-heap, memcached, etc).\n\nSo messy and confusing from my side of the fence.

This can occur if the two enum classes were loaded through different classLoaders.\n\nSo basically, if you're trying to force any extensions to ONLY use the values presented, and not intending the security set to be extendable, then there can be a good argument for enums.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/182046218/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/182061298","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/2263#issuecomment-182061298","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2263","id":182061298,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MjA2MTI5OA==","user":{"login":"jon-wei","id":8729063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MjkwNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8729063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei","html_url":"https://github.com/jon-wei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-09T20:52:54Z","updated_at":"2016-02-09T20:52:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@nishantmonu51 \n\nRE: null handling, the nulls are being converted to 0.  It's not in this PR, but a follow on PR that I am finishing up:\n\nhttps://github.com/jon-wei/druid/blob/5bffacec5772718bcb948b81e6ace4192d940396/processing/src/main/java/io/druid/segment/IndexMerger.java#L1432\n\nThat PR reuses the existing single-value long/float column formats for the numeric dims, representing null without changes to the storage format (need some mechanism to distinguish null from normal values) or using dictionary encoding (have a dictionary entry for null) seems problematic. Throwing an exception sounds okay to me too (maybe let user configure? choice of \"throw exception\" or \"convert null to 0\")\n\nRE: docs and tests, this open PR doesn't actually enable the use of long/float dimensions, it's just preparing IncrementalIndex for later changes:\n- It doesn't provide a way to specify dimension typing in the schema\n- No query/filter/extraction fn, etc. support for long/floats yet\n\nI address those points and have tests in the follow-on patch (not ready yet), I think it would make more sense to include docs in the later PR when the numeric dims are actually usable\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/182061298/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/182061543","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/2263#issuecomment-182061543","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2263","id":182061543,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MjA2MTU0Mw==","user":{"login":"jon-wei","id":8729063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MjkwNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8729063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei","html_url":"https://github.com/jon-wei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-09T20:53:24Z","updated_at":"2016-02-09T20:53:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@fjy @nishantmonu51 will file issues for TODOs\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/182061543/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/182071297","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/2291#issuecomment-182071297","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2291","id":182071297,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MjA3MTI5Nw==","user":{"login":"b-slim","id":7376396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNzYzOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7376396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim","html_url":"https://github.com/b-slim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-09T21:19:07Z","updated_at":"2016-02-09T21:19:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@drcrallen can you please check this one more time ?

this looks good to me, one issue remaining is that users could accidentally lose ingested data if the following happens,\n\n1) process A starts a delta ingestion using this method, it fails\n2) process B updates that interval with some new data\n3) process A starts a delta ingestion using this method, it succeeds, wiping away data from (2)\n\nor even,\n\n1) process A reads list of segments\n2) process B updates data for that interval\n3) process A submits delta ingest job, wiping away data from (2)\n\nThis could be addressed using overlord locking, by having the hadoop task check on start that the segments in the ingestion spec actually correspond to the currently-used segments. Then the retry would be both idempotent and safe (it would protect against the race above).\n\nif you prefer not to do this now, then I think this PR could go through as-is (since the method in this PR works OK if there is some external locking on the user's side) but we should file an issue to fix this for the case where the is no external
