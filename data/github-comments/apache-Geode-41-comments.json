Nevertheless, the method that was making use of the cache appeared as deprecated since Geode 1.3. In the comment, about the deprecation, it was recommended to use another method of the class that created an SSLConfig each time.\r\nGiven that the cache had some thread-safety issues to be solved and given that the method managing the was deprecated I figured the best option would be to just remove it.\r\nAnyway, if it was a mistake to remove it, I offer myself to put it back.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/550519234/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/550544219","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/4204#issuecomment-550544219","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/4204","id":550544219,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MDU0NDIxOQ==","user":{"login":"kohlmu-pivotal","id":11528691,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTI4Njkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11528691?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kohlmu-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/kohlmu-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kohlmu-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kohlmu-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kohlmu-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kohlmu-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kohlmu-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kohlmu-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kohlmu-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kohlmu-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kohlmu-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-06T23:14:11Z","updated_at":"2019-11-06T23:14:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@albertogpz Thank you for this.\r\nI think there are some good fixes in the PR.

I've made some minor comments on the code and I have a bigger one, probably too late to implement but will throw it here anyway, though: the whole PR uses names like `query-config-service` for `XML` and `QueryConfigurationService*` for classes, which seems a bit confusing to me... wouldn't it be better to change this naming `query-service` / `query-service-config` and `QueryServiceConfiguration` instead as it was in the [original proposal](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/GEODE/OQL+Method+Invocation+Security#OQLMethodInvocationSecurity-ConfigurationOptions)?. I believe it better reflects the intent of the feature.\r\n\r\nWe wanted to avoid confusing between the QueryService (the previously existing service) and our new Service class which configures it. We also wanted to maintain the naming pattern used by other cache services, which end with the term 'Service'. We feel the most accurate name would be \"QueryServiceConfigurationService\" as it is a service which configures the query service, but truncated it to QueryConfigurationService as we felt the full name sounded a bit wordy and confusing. For now we plan to leave this as it is but if the naming becomes an issue we can always create a new PR to change it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/553527814/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/553609168","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/4321#issuecomment-553609168","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/4321","id":553609168,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MzYwOTE2OA==","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-13T21:22:14Z","updated_at":"2019-11-13T21:22:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"We have some jobs (StressNewTest) that are getting close to the 6 hour mark, so lets bump the instance-reaper out to 12h","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/553609168/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/553614176","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/4322#issuecomment-553614176","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/4322","id":553614176,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MzYxNDE3Ng==","user":{"login":"Bill","id":4002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill","html_url":"https://github.com/Bill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-13T21:34:58Z","updated_at":"2019-11-13T21:34:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This branch had an approved PR a week or so ago.
