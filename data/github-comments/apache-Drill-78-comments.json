I know @vdiravka did some work on the TravisCI and i'm wondering if your PR just doesn't have that incorporated.  In any event, I'm kind of thinking that the Travis CI is something we may want to drop from Drill.  It seems to be really flaky and wasting a lot of people's time.

Iexplain a bit about how EVF2 works. There are two case: wildcard projection (SELECT *) and explicit projection (SELECT a, b, c). The way EVF2 works is different in these two cases.\r\n\r\nThen, for each reader, there are three other cases. The reader might know all its columns before the file is even opened. The PCAP reader is an example: all PCAP files have the same schema, so we don't need to look at the file to know the schema. The second case are files were we can learn the schema when opening the file. Parquet and CSV are examples: we can learn the Parquet schema from the file metadata, and CSV schema from the headers. The last case is where we don't know the schema until we read each row. JSON is the best example.\r\n\r\nSo, now we have six cases to consider. This is why EVF2 is so complex!\r\n\r\nFor the wildcard, EVF2 \"discovers\" columns as the reader creates them: either via the up-front schema, or as the reader reads data. In JSON, for example, we can discover a new column at any time. Once a column is added, EVF2 will automatically fill in null values if values are missing. In the extreme case, it can fill in nulls for an entire batch. Because of the wildcard, all discovered columns are materialized and added to the result set. If reading JSON, and a column does not appear until the third batch, then the first two won't contain that column, but the third batch will have a schema change and will include the column. This can cause a problem for operators such as joins, sort or aggregation that have to store a collection of rows, not all can handle a schema change.\r\n\r\nNow, for the explicit schema case, EVF2 knows what columns the user wants: those in the list. EVF2 waits as long as it can, hoping the reader will provide the columns. Again, the reader can provide them up front, before the first record, or as the read proceeds (as in JSON.) As the reader provides each column, EVF2 has to decide: do we need that column? If so, we create a vector and a column writer: we materialize the column. If the column is not needed, EVF2 creates a dummy column writer.\r\nNow the interesting part. Suppose we get to the end of the first batch, the query wants column c, and the reader has never defined column c? What do we do? In this case, we have to make something up. Historically, Drill would make up a Nullable Int, with all-null values. EVF added the ability to specify the type for such columns, and we use that. If a provided schema is available, then the user tells us the type.\r\n\r\nNow we get to another interesting part. What if we guessed, say, Varchar, but the column later shows up as a JSON array? We're stuck: we can't go back and redo the old batches. We end up with a \"hard\" schema change. Bad things happen unless the query is really simple. This is the fun of Drill's schemaless system.\r\n\r\nWith that background, we can try to answer your question. The answer is: it depends. If the reader says, \"hey Mr. EVF2, here is the full schema I will read, I promise not to discover more columns\", then EVF2 will throw an exception if later you say, \"ha! just kidding. Actually, I discovered another one.\" I wonder if that's what is happening here.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the reader left the schema open, and said, \"here are the columns I know about now, but I might find more later\", then EVF2 will expect more columns, and will handle them as above: materialize them if they are projected or if we have a wildcard, provide a dummy writer if we have explicit projection and the column is not projected.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we have two separate cases in the reader constructor.\r\n\r\n* In the `if `path, we define a \"reader schema\", and reserve the right to add more columns later. \"That's what the `false` argument means to `tableSchema()`.\r\n* In the `else` path, we define no schema at all: we don't all `tableSchema()`.\r\n\r\nThis means the reader is doing two entirely different things. In the `if` case, we define the schema and we just ask for column writers by name. In the `else` case, we don't define a schema, and we have to define the column when we ask for the column writers.\r\n\r\nThis seems horribly complicated! I wonder, are we missing logic in the `then` case? Or, should there be two distinct readers, each of which implements one of the above cases?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/1102092604/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/1102685834","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2516#issuecomment-1102685834","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2516","id":1102685834,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAFa5xc5BuaaK","user":{"login":"lgtm-com[bot]","id":43144390,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDMxNDQzOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/17324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/lgtm-com","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-19T13:53:56Z","updated_at":"2022-04-19T13:53:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This

Thank you for the quick work.\r\nFrom the end of the most recent discussion, I completely rejected my previous code revision, guess that the unprojected handle might have been lost. Actually, I've added this function locally, but I'm not sure it's correct.
