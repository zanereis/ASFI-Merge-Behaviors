It's a bit weird for the same underlying JSON object to sometimes end up in a Druid row that matches `null` for a particular dimension, and sometimes doesn't, just based on whether that dimension is

This set of AND clauses would then be partitioned into two sets:\n- First set contains AND clauses containing filters that can use bitmap indexes\n- Second set contains AND clauses with at least one filter requiring a column scan\n\nThe first set would be used to create bitmap index during cursor generation, the second set is applied as a ValueMatcher during iteration.\n\nI suppose it would also be possible to allow this two-stage filtering to work with an OR split, i.e.:\n- Bitmaps are used not as a pre-filter but as a \"cache\" of matched rows (don't pre-filter any rows, check the bitmap first before appying ValueMatcher to rows during column scan)\n- Maybe accompanied with a similar filter transformation to disjunctive normal form? (set of OR clauses)\n\nMaybe a viable approach would be to let the user configure this aspect of filtering behavior:\n- Query-level option that configures whether to convert filters to CNF, DNF, or leave user-provided filters as-is\n  - This could address situations where the normalized form is needlessly complex/inefficient, let the user manually arrange the AND/OR clauses if needed\n- If top-level filter is AND, use bitmaps as filter\n- If top-level filter is OR, use bitmaps as matched row \"cache\"\n- If top-level is NOT, convert boolean children accordingly and then apply the rules above\n\nReturning to the example you provided with a NOT on an AND filter on two of my hypothetical string filters, maybe it's better to postpone support for allowing a single non-boolean filter to return both a bitmap index and value matcher. There would have to be a new way for the individual filter to express whether the returned bitmap index/valuematcher pair is in an AND relation or an OR relation, and none of the current filters seem like they would require support for that feature.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/202705839/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/202940585","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/2755#issuecomment-202940585","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2755","id":202940585,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwMjk0MDU4NQ==","user":{"login":"nishantmonu51","id":5023786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjM3ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5023786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51","html_url":"https://github.com/nishantmonu51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-29T14:59:51Z","updated_at":"2016-03-29T14:59:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":":+1:

For example a selector filter would want to return a bitmap on a string dimension but a value matcher on a column that doesn't have an index (like `__time` or a numeric dimension without an index).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/203011831/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/203012935","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/2692#issuecomment-203012935","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2692","id":203012935,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwMzAxMjkzNQ==","user":{"login":"fjy","id":428325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODMyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy","html_url":"https://github.com/fjy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-29T17:30:13Z","updated_at":"2016-03-29T17:30:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@navis any chance of addressing these comments?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/203012935/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/203015079","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/2742#issuecomment-203015079","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2742","id":203015079,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwMzAxNTA3OQ==","user":{"login":"jon-wei","id":8729063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MjkwNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8729063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei","html_url":"https://github.com/jon-wei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-29T17:33:44Z","updated_at":"2016-03-29T17:34:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"agreed, I think returning bitmap/value matcher should be dynamically chosen based on the column capabilities\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/203015079/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/203015732","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/2525#issuecomment-203015732","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2525","id":203015732,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwMzAxNTczMg==","user":{"login":"fjy","id":428325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODMyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy","html_url":"https://github.com/fjy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-29T17:34:45Z","updated_at":"2016-03-29T17:34:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@navis can we update docs/content/development/extensions.md?
