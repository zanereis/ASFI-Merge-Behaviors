point actually is that you get OverflowError's if margin is too large, for example:\n\n``` python\n>>> from math import exp\n>>> margin = -1000\n>>> prob = 1/(1 + exp(-margin))\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nOverflowError: math range error\n>>>\n```\n\nThis actually happened to me, which is how I saw this issue.\n\nThere are (at least) two ways to solve this: One is to check margin instead of prob; this has the advantage of also saving a computation. Even if you allow the user to specify the probability threshold p at some later date, you can just change the margin cutoff from 0 to log(p/(1-p)).\n\nThe second solution is to replace math.exp with np.exp, which gives a warning rather than an exception:\n\n``` python\n>>> import numpy as np\n>>> margin = -1000\n>>> prob = 1/(1 + np.exp(-margin))\n__main__:1: RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in exp\n>>> prob\n0.0\n>>>\n```\n\nFor robustness of the code, perhaps you should at least do that.\n\nThanks!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50508305/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50509704","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1542#issuecomment-50509704","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1542","id":50509704,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNTA5NzA0","user":{"login":"mridulm","id":1591700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTE3MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1591700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm","html_url":"https://github.com/mridulm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-29T17:30:51Z","updated_at":"2014-07-29T17:30:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"That was super scarey !

Primary considerations are support for Binary Multilingual Plane BMP in codepoint ranges 0x0000 to 0xffff and then Supplementary Unicode in range 0x10000 to 0x10ffff.  \n\nHere is an authoratative (though admittedly dated) source from the java platform team:\n\nhttp://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/javase/supplementary-142654.html\n\nThere are a few details in there that have opened my eyes, including 8-byte sequences that use (0xD800-0xDBff,0xDC00-0xDFFF) pairs for Supplementary Unicode chars. \n\nRE: the semantics: it seems the  semantics would want to be: how many Characters (not 16-bit chars) are in the string.   The downside of this: it would also be nice to know how many BYTES are in the string.  I will mull on these two options, but am leaning towards the former.\n\nI will elaborate on these topics later today.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50529156/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50529499","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1628#issuecomment-50529499","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1628","id":50529499,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNTI5NDk5","user":{"login":"mengxr","id":829644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyOTY0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/829644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr","html_url":"https://github.com/mengxr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-29T19:57:09Z","updated_at":"2014-07-29T19:57:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes, having directories is the way to organize packages in python.
