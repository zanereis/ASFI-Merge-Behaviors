Just a couple of comments to streamline this:\n\n1) Layout: Could you please create a more compact output? Something like (a) Spark transfer counts (par, bc, col), (b) Spark transfer times (par, bc, col)\n2) Measurement: You should only include the actual buffer pool interactions into this measurements. Please exclude instructions and specific jobs that are anyway measured separately. Also for collect and similar functions please include everything that corresponds to a given matrix as one measurement.\n3) Statistic maintenance: Furthermore, please also wrap statistic maintenance into the DmlScript.STATISTIC flag - for very small usecases, stats maintenance itself becomes the bottleneck so we only measure if explicitly requested via -stats.\n4) Thread-safeness: Keep in mind that broadcast/collect/parallelize might be called in a multi-threaded parfor context. So please use atomics to prevent anomalies like lost updates.\n5) Consistency: For internal consistency, it would be good to remove the Spark class from Statistics and try to integrate your additions similar to existing measurements.

Would scripts/staging be the place to put an algorithm contribution that is validated but does not have the additional points 1) through 3)?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/189402119/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/189419953","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/83#issuecomment-189419953","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/83","id":189419953,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4OTQxOTk1Mw==","user":{"login":"mboehm7","id":13721609,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzIxNjA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13721609?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7","html_url":"https://github.com/mboehm7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-26T18:46:57Z","updated_at":"2016-02-26T18:46:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Let's put it under ./scripts/staging for now, once we ran sufficient experiments and added required performance features we can put it under algorithms and add necessary documentation. \n\nSubsequently we can add tests too but we cannot require it given that only a subset of our existing algorithms is included in our test suite.

Perhaps a new script can undergo an \"incubation\", which can involve contributions from the community (add test cases, validate performance, etc) to assist in its move to being a main algorithm.\n\nWe should make sure that our process of accepting new DML scripts: (1) maintains the integrity of existing first-tier algorithms and (2) encourages algorithm writers to contribute new scripts. This 'process' could be as simple as starting a new script in the staging directory and moving it to ./scripts/algorithms when it graduates once it meets the requirements of a first-tier algorithm.

Since you deal in any case with scalars (eps or 0), I would recommend to compile for type BASIC a 0 instead of the -1 into the instruction, pass it as a scalar double to libmatrixmult, and simplify the internals of libmatrixmult wcemm accordingly. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/198630588/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/198630987","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/93#issuecomment-198630987","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/93","id":198630987,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5ODYzMDk4Nw==","user":{"login":"mboehm7","id":13721609,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzIxNjA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13721609?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7","html_url":"https://github.com/mboehm7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-19T04:20:01Z","updated_at":"2016-03-19T04:20:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"also thanks for the cleanup of the lops construction of other quaternary operator types.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/198630987/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/198845674","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/93#issuecomment-198845674","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/93","id":198845674,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5ODg0NTY3NA==","user":{"login":"gweidner","id":12058879,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4ODc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058879?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner","html_url":"https://github.com/gweidner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-20T04:34:06Z","updated_at":"2016-03-20T04:34:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thank you @mboehm7 for the review.

It's too late now but I would have started with the writers as this allows to add separate component tests right away. The current patch has a couple of issues:\n\n1) FrameIndexes/IndexedFrameBlock: please remove these additional data structures as they are plain copies of MatrixIndexes and IndexedMatrixValue and they are not needed for frames.\n2) Unnecessary binary read methods: Also, please delete the binary read methods readBinaryBlockBlocksFromHDFS() and readIndexedFrameBlocks() as they are unnecessary.\n3) Binary block serialization: Don't use the binary block serialization framework - it will reject frameblocks anyway as they are not supported.\n4) ValueType handling: Please remove the custom value type handling from all text readers and use UtilFunctions.stringToObject() instead.\n5) FrameBlock copy: It would be good to add some testcases to org.apache.sysml.test.integration.functions.frame for these copy operations. These tests would have shown that the copy cannot work like that: (a) the copy constructor only does a shallow copy of column references, (b) the copy of partial matrix blocks will run into arrayoutofbounds on the column references and also never copies the actual data.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/199539133/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/199920419","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/94#issuecomment-199920419","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/94","id":199920419,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5OTkyMDQxOQ==","user":{"login":"deroneriksson","id":12634533,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjM0NTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12634533?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson","html_url":"https://github.com/deroneriksson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-22T17:28:59Z","updated_at":"2016-03-22T17:28:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@bertholdreinwald I updated the inmemory.xml file to include several libraries that were required to run the JMLC example.
