@tony810430 thank you for the pull request!\r\nThe code looks good.\r\n\r\nMy feeling is, though, that the number of checkpoints to retain is something that we want rather in the configuration of the JobManager, than in the programs snapshot settings.\r\n\r\nThink of it like that: There are often two roles, *developer* and *ops*.\r\n  - The developer writes the streaming program, and sets the values for the snapshot settings, like what checkpoint interval would work well for the application etc.\r\n  - The ops person writes the cluster's config and is concerned with running the job reliably.\r\n\r\nHaving multiple retained checkpoints is something that concerns more the ops person.\r\n\r\nWhat do you

The `notifyFinalState` can be divided into two steps:\r\n\r\n- Execute the `RunAsync` message by akka actor and this is a tell action, and it will trigger to run `unregisterTaskAndNotifyFinalState`.\r\n- In process of `unregisterTaskAndNotifyFinalState`, it will trigger the rpc message of `updateTaskExecutionState`, and it is a ask action, so the mechanism can avoid lost message.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that it may cause OOM before trigger `updateTaskExecutionState`, and this error is caught by `AkkaRpcActor` and does not do anything resulting in interrupting the following process. The `updateTaskExecutionState` will not be executed anymore.\r\n\r\nFor the key point interaction between TaskExecutor and JobMaster, it should not tolerate lost message, and I agree with your above suggestions. So there may be two ideas for this improvement:\r\n\r\n- Enhance the robustness of `notifyFinalState`, and the current rethrow OOM is an easy option, but it will cause the TaskExecutor exit，there should be other ways to make the cost reduction.\r\n- After get cancel acknowledge in JobMaster side, it can trigger a timeout to check the execution final state. If the execution has not entered the final state within timeout, the JobMaster can resend the acknowledge message to TaskExecutor to confirm the status.\r\n\r\nAnd I prefers the first way to just make it sense in one side, avoid the complex interaction between TaskExecutor and JobMaster. \r\n\r\nWish your further suggestions or any ideas.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/281555321/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/281571278","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2460#issuecomment-281571278","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2460","id":281571278,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MTU3MTI3OA==","user":{"login":"wuchong","id":5378924,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNzg5MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5378924?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong","html_url":"https://github.com/wuchong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-22T05:10:57Z","updated_at":"2017-02-22T05:11:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi @shijinkui , sorry for the delay, the change looks very good to me.
