(This is not a solution, just one more point in the analysis pointing to classpath based projects being broken).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1872609695/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1872652082","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/6400#issuecomment-1872652082","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/6400","id":1872652082,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5vnmcy","user":{"login":"junichi11","id":738383,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczODM4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/738383?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11","html_url":"https://github.com/junichi11","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-31T02:30:30Z","updated_at":"2023-12-31T02:30:30Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"No response.

I wonder what is your proposal on how things should work (or if it is just \"exactly the same way as before\").\r\n\r\nMore specifically, JEP 458:\r\nhttps://openjdk.org/jeps/458\r\n\r\nis part of JDK 22. I personally don't need a support for it at all, and but for various reasons there's a need to support it in the VS Code extension.\r\n\r\nThis JEP is basically \"any groups of files anywhere on a disk may be used as a project by running one of them\". Given how project-oriented NetBeans is, it is not really clear how to approach it. And, to get some features work reliably or at all, we need the index.\r\n\r\nThere are various ways to approach this, including:\r\n1. when we encounter a file, we find the corresponding source root, and index it. This is the current behavior. Works until someone tries to open something too big and weird in Favorites.\r\n2. as above, just don't index. Things may work worse, but less change in behavior from the NetBeans 20 state.\r\n3. as 1., but have some predefined directories which we would ignore, like `/tmp` or `$HOME`. I don't really this, though.\r\n4. as 1., but only when the file is opened in the editor, not aggressively when its seen.\r\n5. force the user to somehow mark the directories and/or files that should be part of the multi-source handling.\r\n6. not support JEP 458.\r\n\r\nI guess I am fine with any approach inside the NetBeans/Swing UI. I don't think I would like to turn down the behavior for the VS Code extension, but it should be possible to have different behaviors. (Moreover, given the \"Workspace\" concept, the issue does not really exist in VS Code.)\r\n\r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1875840054/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1876211925","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/6909#issuecomment-1876211925","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/6909","id":1876211925,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5v1LjV","user":{"login":"lbnnbs","id":65210850,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MjEwODUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65210850?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbnnbs","html_url":"https://github.com/lbnnbs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbnnbs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbnnbs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbnnbs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbnnbs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbnnbs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbnnbs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbnnbs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbnnbs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbnnbs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-04T02:07:52Z","updated_at":"2024-01-04T02:10:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"`<?php\r\n\r\nclass Test {\r\n    \r\n    /**\r\n     * \r\n     * @return int\r\n     */\r\n    public function Type() {\r\n        return 0;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public function aaa() {\r\n        // code completion make mistake here\r\n        $this->Type()->\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n`\r\n\r\n![微信截图_20240104100442](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/assets/65210850/c7c66658-8509-4862-931b-0c6235ae1a67)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1876211925/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1876246728","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/6909#issuecomment-1876246728","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/6909","id":1876246728,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5v1UDI","user":{"login":"junichi11","id":738383,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczODM4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/738383?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11","html_url":"https://github.com/junichi11","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-04T03:04:59Z","updated_at":"2024-01-04T03:04:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Reproducible.

I think that IDE support will always be hard for this kind of project (sorry about the word-play). The interesting bit I read there is, that the launcher must ignore all java files, that are not referenced by the file being run:\r\n\r\n> Only .java files whose classes are referenced by the program are compiled. This allows developers to play with new versions of code without worrying that old versions will be compiled accidentally. For example, suppose the directory also contains OldProg.java, whose older version of the Prog class expects the Helper class to have a method named go rather than run. The presence of OldProg.java, with its latent error, is immaterial when running Prog.java.\r\n\r\nSo what can you expect from the IDE in such a ~~mess~~ flexible setup?  For example should refactoring tools ignore non referenced files? Should errors flagged in \"renamed\" files? Should references between the components be checked?\r\n\r\nI only worked with VSCode shortly and my understanding is, that what you called \"Workspace\" is a \"directory\" opened for working with it. This sounds an awful lot like the \"Lightweight C/C++-Project\" for LSP based native support and would also match option 5 you listed. I think at some point we'll need an \"ephemeral project\" manager to remove such projects, but a stop gap?!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1877658689/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1878008461","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/6912#issuecomment-1878008461","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/6912","id":1878008461,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5v8CKN","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-05T02:01:08Z","updated_at":"2024-01-05T02:11:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"just a thought:\r\n\r\nNetBeans can store file properties for java files (as used for jvm/program args).

I suspect at some point JS files were being indexed and thus the CP for these is initialized.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1879703578/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1879766715","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/6921#issuecomment-1879766715","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/6921","id":1879766715,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5wCva7","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-06T17:49:56Z","updated_at":"2024-01-06T17:51:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@matthiasblaesing thanks for elaborating, this clears up why NB is indexing content of those particular zip files, but not quite why NB thinks it is important to index them while the user is looking at a hello world maven project.

I didn't even think to try that.\r\n\r\nI also added support for project aware new files.  Right-click on something in the project explorer and selecting New should now present meson file options as well as options appropriate for whatever netbeans aware languages the meson project is configured for (C, C++, fortran, java, rust).\r\n\r\nAs for the error shown in \"Suggestion II/clarification\" above,  I'm curious as to how the project got into that state.  The .netbeans/build/default directory exists but appears to have .gitignore and .hgignore files in it but not a complete meson build directory.  I would guess that happened due to a previous failure of the \"meson setup\" command.  Manually re-running the \"Setup\" action from right-clicking on the project should have fixed the situation.\r\n\r\nI added detection of invalid/incomplete meson build directories which should result in automatic running of \"meson setup\" when necessary even when the build directory exists.  I tested the condition above and it now seems to work for me.\r\n\r\nThanks for pointing that problem out as I failed to imagine it.  The module should behave much more robustly now.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1880187787/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1880455529","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/6912#issuecomment-1880455529","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/6912","id":1880455529,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5wFXlp","user":{"login":"lahodaj","id":51319204,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzE5MjA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51319204?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lahodaj","html_url":"https://github.com/lahodaj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lahodaj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lahodaj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lahodaj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lahodaj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lahodaj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lahodaj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lahodaj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lahodaj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lahodaj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-08T06:41:02Z","updated_at":"2024-01-08T06:41:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"FWIW, I'll make an editor hint, to explicitly enable the scanning.
