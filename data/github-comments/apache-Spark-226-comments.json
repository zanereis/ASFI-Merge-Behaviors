not sure I understood your last comment, but anyway: these object had references to them at some point. What you're suggesting is that, at some point, those references stopped existing, but there's still clean up that needs to be done. And if you're doing that clean up by using the gc, it means the cleanup is happening in a finalizer, which is bad.\n\nThat means there is a bug in the code that is getting rid of those references: it should be doing this cleanup.\n\nThis is no different than having to call `close()` on an InputStream. Yes, you can not do it and leave it for the GC to invoke finalizers, but that's wrong. Your code should explicitly close the streams.\n\nUnless I'm misunderstanding what you're trying to achieve.

The reason is that we felt we could continue supporting these low-level APIs indefinitely and add other ones later if we need to. Again, for real users, API stability matters _much_ more than you'd think -- there's nothing more annoying than having to change your app to implement a software upgrade, and it causes fragmentation of the userbase as users stick to an older version instead of upgrading.\n\nIn this particular case, there are a few things we can do. We can think of additions to the API here that preserve the old methods but add new versions of predict. We can add a new class called LongALS or something like that, and have these ones call it and get back a LongMatrixFactorizationModel. Or we can offer a utility to generate unique IDs.\n\nThe reason I was asking about hash collisions above is that even with 64-bit IDs, you're not guaranteed to be collision-free. With 2-3 billion users you actually have a good chance of a collision.

Have you tried all of them (and combinations thereof, since you can run different gcs in the young and old gens) in different memory pressure scenarios?\n\nThese kinds of questions are why you shouldn't be trying to do that. It's sort of ok to have that code in a test, especially given what the test is trying to do. The test environment is more controlled that the environment where Spark apps themselves are deployed. So you can't just take that code, put it into the main code base, and say the issue is fixed...\n\nAlso, did you take a look at https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1387#issuecomment-49072342?

didn't suggest having a new implementation for long IDs, only a new API. They can run on the same implementation (e.g. the current Int-based one transforms the Ints to Longs and calls that one). This is a much more sensible way to evolve the API and it's very common in other software. All our MLlib APIs were designed to support this kind of evolution (e.g. you set your parameters using a builder pattern, where we can add new methods, and the top-level API is just functions you can call that we can easily map to more complex versions of the functions).\n\nThe place I'm coming from is that there are _far_ more complex APIs than ours that have retained backwards compatibility over decades, and were maintained by a similar-sized team. One great example is Java's class library, which is not only a great library but has also been compatible since 1.0. There are well-known ways to retain compatibility while still improving the API, such as adding a new package (e.g. java.nio vs java.io). I would be totally fine doing that with MLlib as we gain experience with it, but there's no reason to break the old API in the process. Again, I feel that people from today's tech company world think way too much about \"perfecting\" an API by repeatedly tweaking it, and while that works within a single engineering team, it doesn't work in software that you expect someone else to use.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49104793/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49104938","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1393#issuecomment-49104938","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1393","id":49104938,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MTA0OTM4","user":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-15T23:10:07Z","updated_at":"2014-07-15T23:10:07Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Wise words Matei! anyway here's another cut that preserves the original API.

For instance, I looked in the `JobProgressListener` and we index many things on `StageId` that might better be indexed on `StageId, AttemptId`. Also, we should probably give the `AttemptId` when start a task so that we understand which stage attempt to associated it with. I also don't understand exactly what happens when a stage gets re-attempted, do we send a \"stage completed\" event? It might be good to fix the way we deal with stage re-submissions to make this work better overall.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49111190/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49111342","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1384#issuecomment-49111342","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1384","id":49111342,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MTExMzQy","user":{"login":"kayousterhout","id":1108612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDg2MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1108612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout","html_url":"https://github.com/kayousterhout","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-16T00:46:19Z","updated_at":"2014-07-16T00:46:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rxin  is this something you've thought about in your various schedule refactoring things?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49111342/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49111726","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1384#issuecomment-49111726","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1384","id":49111726,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MTExNzI2","user":{"login":"pwendell","id":320616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDYxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/320616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell","html_url":"https://github.com/pwendell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-16T00:52:34Z","updated_at":"2014-07-16T00:52:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tsudukim I created a JIRA to deal with the broader issue.
