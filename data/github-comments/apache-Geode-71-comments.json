I would be ok with going further and removing the restriction. As far as I know the only reason to put the region and the sender in the same disk store is to avoid accidentally deleting one of the disk stores.\r\n> \r\n> A long time ago we discussed some changes that might make it better for a region and a sender to be the same disk store. For example, the new value in the region and the new value going to the gateway sender are the same bytes, so we might theoretically be able to to avoid duplicating those bytes on disk. However, we're not doing anything like that right now.\r\n\r\n@upthewaterspout Thanks for your answer. I think it is best to remove the restriction given that the only reason we have for it is to avoid problems when there is an accidental deletion of one of the disk stores.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/1038742735/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/1039422049","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/7303#issuecomment-1039422049","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/7303","id":1039422049,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAhObV8499FJh","user":{"login":"upthewaterspout","id":857521,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1NzUyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/857521?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout","html_url":"https://github.com/upthewaterspout","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-14T18:36:15Z","updated_at":"2022-02-14T18:36:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It's not clear to me how these changes relate to GEODE-9987. That bug was a failure saying \"Member isn't responding to heartbeat requests\". I don't think this refactoring is going to affect that type of failure - usually that would indicate resource issues on the CI machine or perhaps the need for a larger membership-timeout for this test? It does look like this test probably doesn't need to start so many locators, maybe that would help?\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how I feel about removing the port 0 test. It looks like it was trying to test that members that start up with port 0 as the locator port correctly distribute the *actual* port of the locator to other members, rather than 0? Is the reason you think port 0 is going to cause port conflicts because other tests are using AvailablePortHelper? Seems like we still need a way to write tests that using port 0 actually works.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/1039422049/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/1039659811","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/7348#issuecomment-1039659811","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/7348","id":1039659811,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAhObV8499_Mj","user":{"login":"lgtm-com[bot]","id":43144390,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDMxNDQzOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/17324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/lgtm-com","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-14T23:03:26Z","updated_at":"2022-02-14T23:03:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This pull request **introduces 8 alerts** when merging 53501dd6075dcd2dcb300510abda48078473c2f6 into fc3f991c1988bfe45933103abd55b603331a2ec8 -

reviewers,\r\n\r\nWith this solution, each server will now send CacheServerLoadMessage containing the correct connection load of the gateway-receiver to all locators in the cluster. This action will happen every 5 seconds as configured with the load-poll-interval parameter. Additionally, the coordinator locator will increase the load each time it provides the server location to the remote gateway-sender in ClientConnectionRequest/ClientConnectionResponse. Locator only maintains load temporarily until CacheServerLoadMessage is received. This behavior makes sense as the server tracks connection load more accurately than the locator. Locator only increases connection load based on the received connection requests while server adjusts the connection load each time connection is established and disconnected.\r\n\r\nClientConnectionRequest messages are usually sent to the locator in bursts when the gateway-sender is establishing connections due to traffic. This behavior results in the locator's connection load being way ahead of the server connection load because servers did not establish those connections yet. Suppose during these bursts CacheServerLoadMessage message come to locator carrying low load value for one of the gateway-receivers. In that case, that receiver will be picked more frequently (will have the lowest load), resulting in unbalanced gateway-sender connections. In order for this to have a big impact on load-balancing of sender connections the gateway-receivers must be started with some small delay, so that CacheServerLoadMessages are sent with some delay that is enough to cause imbalance. If CacheServerLoadMessages were sent at the similar time then this would not be a problem as all messages would have similar load and would update locator at similar time.\r\n\r\nI would be really grateful if you could share your opinion on this matter?
