So, I tested the following query. (It is a CTAS statement of the case 1 of TAJO-1368.)\n\n```\ncreate table test using parquet as \n  select * from \n    (select c_custkey, c_nationkey from customer where c_nationkey < 0 \n    union all \n    select c_custkey, c_nationkey from customer where c_nationkey > 0 \n    ) a \n  union all \n  select * from \n    (select c_custkey, c_nationkey from customer where c_nationkey < 0 \n    union all \n    select c_custkey, c_nationkey from customer where c_nationkey > 0 \n    ) b \n```\n\nAnd, I found the following error.\n\n```\n2015-03-17 17:29:42,257 ERROR:

This feature still requires unit tests, yet I also don't want to double test time. We can compromise it.\n\nFirst of all, this feature will completely work after we have a better scheduler.

As navis said, we need to keep it disabled by default, and if necessary, users can enable this feature with session variables. \n\nWith this approach, we may not need to verify all unit tests with this feature right now. We won't double the unit test time. Nevertheless, since this feature will require unit tests, it would be great if we test this this feature in only some unit tests like TestJoinQuery and TestUnionQuery, which mostly have independent execution blocks.\n\nAfter we have a better scheduler, Tajo will use this feature by default.

This will be definitely useful. \nHowever, it seems that the title sould be changed. I think that you already know, but would like to explain for clarity. \nIn Tajo, there are three planning phases, i.e., logical planning phase, global planning phase, and physical planning phase. When a query is submitted, the logical planner generates a logical plan based on the query. And then, the global planner generates a master plan that explains how the query is executed in distributed manner. Once the master plan is generated, the query master executes execution blocks of that master plan subsequently. \nAn execution block is executed by multiple workers. For distributed execution, each worker receives the logical plan corresponds to the currently executing execution block. Finally, a worker generates a physical plan based on the received logical plan. It indicates which types of physical operators are used to execute the logical plan. For example, given a logical plan for join, the physical plan indicates that the hash join or sorted-merge join will be used. \nYour work seems to see the the master (global) plan. So, it would be better to change the title. \n\nAnyway, I'm still reviewing. I'll finish soon. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/84362382/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/84378037","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/441#issuecomment-84378037","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/441","id":84378037,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0Mzc4MDM3","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-21T16:02:29Z","updated_at":"2015-03-21T16:02:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@navis your work is nice in overall.

I will happily revise your work, and share with you.\n\nBefore starting revision, I have one more thing to talk with you.\nIMHO, the simple test is not appropriate for query plan verifications. As you know, different query plans can produce the same result, but their efficiency can be significantly different. So, we must add a sufficient amount of tests to check whether Tajo's query planner always generates the best plan, especially for complex queries. \nSo, I wonder what kinds of queries will be used for simple tests.\nDo you have any good idea?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/84601306/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/84606886","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/426#issuecomment-84606886","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/426","id":84606886,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0NjA2ODg2","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-22T13:23:54Z","updated_at":"2015-03-22T13:23:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@navis, this is truly impressive work.\nWith my laptop, the vectorized sorter is faster than Collections.sort() about 25%!\nI left some trivial comments.\nIn addition, it will be great if you add some tests to verify sort result.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/84606886/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
