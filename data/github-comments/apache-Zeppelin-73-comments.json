as of now the interpreters are reusing zeppelin keytab. Typically this is case in the hadoop security world, where the keytab is generated at a process level, whereas the authorization is done through impersonation. This is then mapped to the user permissions setup on the underlying data system via posix users. Mature systems which implement full support for security + impersonation, can provide this ability. Right now with this change we get to the first stage which is security. To get to impersonation we will have to start the shell with the user's identity.

And WorkflowManager, WorkflowJob, and so on. \n\nI think there is much simpler way achieve the same goal, with more flexible/powerful workflow control while keeping usage simple and easy.\n\nCurrently, [z.run(PARAGRAPH_ID)](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/spark/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/spark/ZeppelinContext.java#L291) in spark interpreter allows run other paragraph in the same notebook. \n\nSimply extend this method, from\n\n```\nz.run(PARAGRAPH_ID)   # run paragraph in current notebook\n```\n\nto\n\n```\nz.run(PARAGRAPH_ID)   # run paragraph in any notebook\nz.run(NOTE_ID)        # run all paragraphs in the notebook\n```\n\nwill achieve the same goal without introducing new syntax or WorkflowManager.\nThen user can define workflow in scala programming language in spark interpreter. e.g.\n\n```\nz.run(\"Paragraph1\")\nz.run(\"Paragraph2\")\nif (somecondition) {\n   z.run(\"Paragraph3\")\n} else {\n   z.run(\"Note2\")\n}\n```\n\nAnd note that, `z.run()` feature can be implemented not only in SparkInterpreter but also in any other interpreter. Therefore, other interpreter may provide different interface (python, etc) to access this feature. And if we really want new syntax, it's even possible to create `%workflow` interpreter and provide custom syntax or some gui using AngularDisplay system to define and run workflow.\n\nSo, i think just improving `z.run()` provides more flexible, modular, easier solution.\n\nWhat do you think?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/232590340/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/232591242","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1162#issuecomment-232591242","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1162","id":232591242,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMjU5MTI0Mg==","user":{"login":"AhyoungRyu","id":10060731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYwNzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10060731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu","html_url":"https://github.com/AhyoungRyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-14T08:00:40Z","updated_at":"2016-07-14T08:00:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bzz Sure that make sense and thanks for clarifying it.

Thanks for the suggestion. I think we need to update docs and it's time to install Eclipse by myself in order to check the difference between Eclipse and Intellij.

How about adding 404 page (like github does) instead of just redirecting `Home` without any message? i think they need to know that the link is not existed. Otherwise they can feel it's a bug. In 404 page, we can add sth like \"This is not the notebook page you are looking for\" with some button for redirecting to home.

I have added unit tests, but the tests will work with a valid google project id on google compute, else it will fail. This is because the test has to run against the bigquery service which does not have a local build.\n2. I have added a server side cancel operation. However I could not find a viable method to report progress. Will implement this if this becomes available as part of big query API in the future.\n3. Implemented dynamic interpreter\n4.

I have tested and reviewed the code. and looks good except one behavior.\n\nLet's say there're two interpreter settings. `spark1` and `spark2` (and no interpreter setting name `spark`).\n\npreviously '%spark' select `spark1` or `spark2` whichever in front of binded interpreter list.\nnow, '%spark' is printing `Prefix not found`.\n\nSo after this PR, in this specific case, notebook will not be run before user change interpreter selection text in every paragraphs.\n\nHow do you think about supporting previous interpreter selection mechanism, too? Will there be any side effect to support previous interpreter selection mechanism? Or do you think it's better support new selection mechanism only?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/232885412/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/232885568","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1187#issuecomment-232885568","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1187","id":232885568,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMjg4NTU2OA==","user":{"login":"AhyoungRyu","id":10060731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYwNzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10060731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu","html_url":"https://github.com/AhyoungRyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-15T07:46:21Z","updated_at":"2016-07-15T07:46:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Is this PR WIP?
