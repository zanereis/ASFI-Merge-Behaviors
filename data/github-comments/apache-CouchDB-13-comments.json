it seemed like I had a network glitch when the configure ran so the mango repository wasn't pulled, it now compiles fine. Now it is just a matter of resolving the make process to work without absolute paths, because right now what happens is this:\n\n```\ninstall_dir = /usr/couchdb\ndata_dir = /var/lib/couchdb\nview_index_dir = /var/lib/couchdb\nlog_file = /var/log/couchdb.log\nuser = couchdb\n```\n\n then we have this issue:\n\n```\n==> rel (generate)\nWARN:  'generate' command does not apply to directory /home/micah/debian/couchdb/couchdb-2.0\nmkdir: cannot create directory ‘/usr/couchdb’: Permission denied\nMakefile:86: recipe for target 'install' failed\nmake[1]: *** [install] Error 1\nmake[1]: Leaving directory '/home/micah/debian/couchdb/couchdb-2.0'\ndh_auto_install: make -j1 install DESTDIR=/home/micah/debian/couchdb/couchdb-2.0/debian/couchdb AM_UPDATE_INFO_DIR=no returned exit code 2\ndebian/rules:3: recipe for target 'binary' failed\n```\n\nThus, the install target in the Makefile fails because it tries to copy to an absolute path from the install.mk. To avoid this one needs to use [$DESTDIR](https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/DESTDIR.html) so it will do things like this (for example):\n\n```\nmkdir $(DESTDIR)$(install_dir)\ncp $(abs_top_srcdir)/foo/bar.erl $(DESTDIR)$(install_dir)/lib\n```\n\netc.\n\nThis should be done in all places of install and uninstall. This also needs to be incorporated in the configure process.

not positive, but I think putting the DESTDIR into the configure script isn't the right place. The DESTDIR environment variable should be usable as a prefix in from of installation paths for supporting changing the prefix at 'make install' time, _without_ changing any of the paths built into the software. I think that changing it in configure will make it so that pathing will get built into all of the things that are made, when it should just be used in the Makefile to change things (for the 'make install').\n\nAs a side note, after running make, running make install should not rebuild any files and in particular shouldn't encode any new paths. Otherwise, it's very hard to install the software in a temporary staging area without including the paths to the staging area in the final software (which in the case of RPATH can even be a security concern).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/108083567/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/108573210","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/302#issuecomment-108573210","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/302","id":108573210,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwODU3MzIxMA==","user":{"login":"janl","id":11321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl","html_url":"https://github.com/janl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-03T18:51:51Z","updated_at":"2015-06-03T18:51:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@micah

but if I do that, then it will change the pathing for the share, var, etc, bin pieces mentioned above.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/110499701/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/113101640","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/302#issuecomment-113101640","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/302","id":113101640,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExMzEwMTY0MA==","user":{"login":"rnewson","id":47223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson","html_url":"https://github.com/rnewson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-18T10:28:58Z","updated_at":"2015-06-18T10:28:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"+1.

do](https://github.com/janl/couchdb/blob/ad287b43ef29964629bdac3eac469f82b78c7d7c/test/build/test-configure.sh): \n\nNote that [most `./configure` arguments are

responsible for generating the build\nsystem for Apache CouchDB.\n\nOptions:\n\n  -h | --help                 display a short help message and exit\n  # -u USER       set the username to run as

request that couchjs is linked to cURL (default false)\n\n  Installation directories:\n    --prefix=PREFIX         install architecture-independent files in PREFIX\n

easy to add).\n\n### State\n\nI used this to produce a tarball that in turn could configure itself and install itself into all designated destinations. I haven’t tried all override options manually, but I’m confident that they work.\n\nThere are a few niggles, but this mostly works.\n\n### Impact\n\n@micah this should give packagers the option to set `--exec-prefix` which used to produce the architecture dependent sub-dirs.\n\n### Misc\n\nAlso note the updates to the check list in [the original post on this page](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/302#issue-57392189).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/113577637/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/113579208","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/302#issuecomment-113579208","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/302","id":113579208,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExMzU3OTIwOA==","user":{"login":"kxepal","id":785983,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NTk4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/785983?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal","html_url":"https://github.com/kxepal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-19T17:13:48Z","updated_at":"2015-06-19T17:13:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Great work, @janl !\ncc @djc and @lemenkov for the feedback as Gentoo and Fedora respectively CouchDB package maintainers.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/113579208/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/113581523","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/302#issuecomment-113581523","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/302","id":113581523,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExMzU4MTUyMw==","user":{"login":"janl","id":11321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl","html_url":"https://github.com/janl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-19T17:26:05Z","updated_at":"2015-06-19T17:26:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"In addition, I wrote up a few notes to make myself understand the whole thing, maybe it helps others, too:\n\n# CouchDB 2.0 build script\n\n## make install\n\n`make install` moves the built CouchDB binaries as well as configuration, log and various other files into their final file system locations.\n\nThere are default locations for all files, and various ways to customise the location of each class of files.\n\nThese classes of files are being installed (with their default location)\n- The CouchDB start script (couchdb) and the couchjs binary (/usr/local/bin/…)\n- Erlang binary release (/usr/local/lib/couchdb/…)\n- Configuration files (/usr/local/etc/couchdb/…)\n- Static support files, like Fauxton and the documentation (/usr/local/share/couchdb/…)\n- Log files (/var/log/couchdb/…)\n\nHere is an overview of the paths:\n- /usr/local/bin/…\n- /usr/local/lib/couchdb/…\n- /usr/local/etc/couchdb/…\n- /usr/local/share/couchdb/…\n- /var/log/couchdb/…\n\nThere are two modifiers for most of these `$prefix` and `DESTDIR`.\n\n### $prefix\n\n`$prefix` defaults to `/usr/local`. You might notice above where it is applied. It is set by `./configure -p $prefix` before `make install`.\n\nFor example, with `./configure -p /opt/local`, the paths look like this:\n- /opt/local/bin/…\n- /opt/local/lib/couchdb/…\n- /opt/local/etc/couchdb/…\n- /opt/local/share/couchdb/…\n- /var/log/couchdb/…\n\n### DESTDIR\n\n`DESTDIR` is for package managers to build and test packages outside of the main operating system paths. It is set as an environment variable before `make install` as in `DESTDIR=/path/to/somewhere make install`. It applies to _all_ file paths.\n\nFor example, with `DESTDIR=/home/anne/ make install`, the paths look like this:\n- /home/anne/usr/local/bin/…\n- /home/anne/usr/local/lib/couchdb/…\n- /home/anne/usr/local/etc/couchdb/…\n- /home/anne/usr/local/share/couchdb/…\n- /home/anne/var/log/couchdb/…\n\n### Other Customisations\n\nFinally, all file class paths are configurable independently, so that (at least) we can be installed into a standard Linux file system tree:\n- /usr/bin/…\n- /etc/couchdb/…\n- /usr/lib/couchdb/…\n- /usr/share/couchdb/…\n- /var/log/couchdb/…\n\nExamples:\n\n`./configure --sysconfdir=/opt/etc`:\n- /opt/etc/couchdb/…\n\n`./configure --bindir=/my/bindir`:\n- /my/bindir/{couchdb,couchjs}\n\n`./configure --libdir=/home/couchdb`\n- /home/couchdb/couchdb/…\n\n`./configure --logdir`\n\n## CouchDB Paths\n\nThe above path settings and customisation options are purely for the benefit of default installations from source and custom installations via package managers.\n\nCouchDB itself cares less about where things are, but it needs to be told, at least, about the location of a few things. These are:\n- Where it is installed: {prefix, \"$INSTALL_DIR\"}.\n- Where database are stored: {data_dir, \"$DATA_DIR\"}.\n- Where view indexes are stored: {view_index_dir, \"$VIEW_DIR\"}.\n- Where the log file is stored: {log_file, \"$LOG_FILE\"}.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/113581523/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/113585378","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/302#issuecomment-113585378","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/302","id":113585378,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExMzU4NTM3OA==","user":{"login":"kxepal","id":785983,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NTk4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/785983?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal","html_url":"https://github.com/kxepal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-19T17:45:11Z","updated_at":"2015-06-19T17:45:11Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Speaking

If distributions do unbundling, they must do this at their own (and their user’s) peril.

Thanks for your perspective.\n\nThe biggest problem here will be with the distributives that provides own packages for specific Erlang apps and tries to unbundle upstream deps like Mochiweb in order to replace them with system packages. Sometimes that causes quite interesting situations when DoS issue if fixed in bundled dep, but not in upstream. So here also we should also limit ourself on what bundles we allow to replace with system packages and what we do not.\n\nBut agree about snappy case in anyway. \n\nP.S. @djc we bundle snappy-1.0.5 which was removed from portage for now. I had somewhere patches to update it up to recent 1.1.2 - need to check if it wouldn't cause any issues since they're used autotools more in recent releases.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/114090050/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/114092556","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/302#issuecomment-114092556","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/302","id":114092556,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNDA5MjU1Ng==","user":{"login":"djc","id":158471,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODQ3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/158471?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/djc","html_url":"https://github.com/djc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-22T12:57:45Z","updated_at":"2015-06-22T12:57:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I agree that maybe for the Erlang deps, it's a different story -- I'm also not sure if we have a good system lib/sharing story there.
