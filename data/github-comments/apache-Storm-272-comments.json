think it would be good to get some of the assumptions I've made down in writing, so I just wrote down a more thorough explanation of the issues I think this PR should fix, and what changes I think it should make:\r\n\r\nThe intention of this PR is to fix an issue where the spout has emitted maxUncommittedOffsets (or more) tuples, and some of them fail, and the spout then hangs because the `numUncommittedOffsets < maxUncommittedOffsets` check when deciding whether to poll doesn't account for retriable tuples. Blindly polling when there are retriable tuples will fix this issue, but leads to us not being able to bound the number of offsets the consumer has read past the last committed offset.\r\n\r\nFor an example of a case where we can't put a bound on uncommitted offsets, say that partition 0 has maxUncommittedOffsets + maxPollRecords emitted tuples past the commit offset, and partition 1 has no emitted tuples (or any number below maxUncommittedOffsets, it doesn't matter).\r\n\r\nWhen tuples fail and become retriable on partition 0, the spout would blindly poll for more tuples. If it gets tuples from partition 0 it's okay, since it seeks back to the committed offset for that partition, so it won't go beyond committedOffset + maxPollRecords (since the retry logic seeks back to the committed offset on every poll, the spout can't go more than maxPollRecords beyond that offset). If it gets tuples from partition 1 we're effectively just emitting new tuples while ignoring maxUncommittedOffsets. Since we aren't controlling which partitions the polled tuples may come from, we can't say anything meaningful about a cap on uncommitted offsets. While I think it would probably work out to being capped anyway, due to the consumer consuming partitions round robin (AFAIK), I'd prefer if the spout implementation doesn't make assumptions beyond those guaranteed by the consumer API (in which case we should assume any call to `KafkaConsumer.poll` could return messages for any assigned non-paused partition).\r\n\r\nSo the way to fix that issue is to ensure that if we're polling for retriable tuples, we only poll on those partitions that have retriable tuples (i.e. we pause the others when doing `doSeekRetriableTopicPartitions`, then resume all assigned after calling `KafkaConsumer.poll`). Pausing the other partitions should only affect that poll cycle, since once retriable tuples get emitted they're no longer retriable, and we won't hit `doSeekRetriableTopicPartitions` for those tuples again right away. In most polls (no failed tuples, or tuples are failed but not ready for retry), we won't hit the pausing case.\r\n\r\nIf we pause partitions with no retriable tuples when polling on partitions with retriable tuples, we should be able to guarantee that any partition never gets more than maxUncommittedOffsets + maxPollRecords - 1 past the last committed offset. In the case where there are no failed tuples, we can reach the limit by having maxUncommittedOffsets - 1 emitted offsets, and polling once, getting up to maxPollRecords more. If there are retriable tuples, pausing will stop us from ignoring the maxUncommittedOffsets cap for partitions with no retriable tuples, and the partitions with retriable tuples won't get more than maxPollRecords beyond the last committed offset, since the consumer seeks back to that offset when polling for retriable offsets.\r\n\r\nThere's a second minor issue I'd like this PR to address:\r\nIf maxPollRecords isn't exactly equal to maxUncommittedOffsets, the spout can behave in some undesirable ways.\r\n* If maxPollRecords is greater than maxUncommittedOffsets, the maxUncommittedOffsets limit may be exceeded on any one poll. In this case there's no reason to have 2 separate variables, since the net effect is the same as setting maxUncommittedOffsets to be equal to maxPollRecords. \r\n* If maxPollRecords is less than maxUncommittedOffsets, there's a risk of the spout getting stuck on some tuples for a while when it is retrying tuples.\r\n  Say there are 10 retriable tuples following the last committed offset, and maxUncommittedOffsets is 10. If maxPollRecords is 5 and the first 5 retriable tuples are reemitted in the first batch, the next 5 tuples can't be emitted until (some of) the first 5 are acked. This is because the spout will seek the consumer back to the last committed offset any time there are failed tuples, which will lead to it getting the first 5 tuples out of the consumer, checking that they are emitted, and skipping them. This will repeat until the last committed offset moves. If there are other partitions with tuples available, those tuples may get emitted, but the \"blocked\" partition won't progress until some tuples are acked on it.\r\n  \r\nI think it might make sense to remove maxUncommittedOffsets entirely, and have the spout use maxPollRecords instead?\r\n\r\nThe tl;dr is that I think we should allow polling if there are retriable offsets, even if `numUncommittedOffsets >= maxUncommittedOffsets`, we should pause non-retriable partitions when polling for retries, and we should maybe merge maxUncommittedOffsets and maxPollRecords.\r\n\r\n@hmcl Could you take a look at this explanation and let me know if I got something wrong, or if you'd prefer to solve the issues in another way? I think it got a bit hypothetical.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/283142607/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612977541","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/6072#issuecomment-2612977541","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/6072","id":2612977541,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI5Nzc1NDE=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-28T21:36:57Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T16:53:35Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a

At-least-once is guaranteed whether we have maxUncommittedOffsets or not.\r\n\r\nIf max spout pending is unset, users should have known that Spout will emit tuples as many and fast as possible unless backpressure is not in place.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/284664246/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612990869","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/6180#issuecomment-2612990869","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/6180","id":2612990869,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI5OTA4Njk=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-07T12:51:04Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T17:00:12Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=xymaqingxiang\">xymaqingxiang</a>:</i>\n<p>Hello all,</p>\n\n<p>I have a questions about storm distributed cache, the method \"getBlobs\" in the \"Localizer\" class, and the method \"DownloadBlob\" in the \"Localizer\" class.<br/>\nIn my opinion, the \"localFile\" parameter is always the blob key, it can not be with the suffix of \".tar.gz\", so the \"unpack\" method can not work, Please help me understand it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks & Regards<br/>\nQingxiang Ma</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612990869/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612946696","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/5820#issuecomment-2612946696","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/5820","id":2612946696,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI5NDY2OTY=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-07T14:15:51Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T16:38:12Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=janecekpetr\">janecekpetr</a>:</i>\n<p>I built the <tt><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-2038\" title=\"Provide an alternative to using symlinks\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-2038\"><del>STORM-2038</del></a>-local-mode-v1.0.3</tt> branch locally, installed it, and ran our test suite against it in Local Mode - all works great without any Administrator privileges.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you.

Two situations come in mind: reached max spout pending, backpressure in place.\r\n\r\nIf spout reached max spout pending, since we are emitting **at most a tuple** for nextTuple() so when tuple tree for a tuple is complete or a tuple fails, nextTuple() can be called. At least nextTuple() will be called after tuple timeout (actually up to 2 * tuple timeout due to underlying implementation).\r\nSo if users can tolerate this, it might be OK, but could be far from configured value.\r\n\r\nIf backpressure is in place, nextTuple() will never be called. We can't guarantee any time frame here.\r\n\r\nIf we want to strictly guarantee that commit occurs in time, it should be apart from spout's lifecycle, like timer.
