I'm trying to working on the `cli` project too. It does not block the replacement process, just some functions.\r\n> \r\n> CLI is a kind of block. Because we have verified the topology already on the current e2e, we at least should keep it.\r\n\r\nSure. Then I think the protocol I mentioned above should also be completed before e2e is implemented.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/886134167/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/886136610","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/7368#issuecomment-886136610","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/7368","id":886136610,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArmls8400V8i","user":{"login":"fgksgf","id":26627380,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjI3Mzgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26627380?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fgksgf","html_url":"https://github.com/fgksgf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fgksgf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fgksgf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fgksgf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fgksgf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fgksgf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fgksgf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fgksgf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fgksgf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fgksgf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-25T02:13:37Z","updated_at":"2021-07-25T02:13:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I

From OpenTracing to OpenTelemetry, there is always a tricky term like a so-called unified solution for tracing. I don't want to waste time to argue whether this is possible or not, whether they(OpenTracing and OpenTelemetry are actually the same groups of people, except I and Adrian[Zipkin] exited) are doing right or wrong.\r\n\r\nBut at least, observability is not tracing. The APM is not just tracing. SkyWalking is doing a used-to-be commercial-level only tracing-based APM system, and now to extend to be a whole APM system including tracing/metrics/logging/event. Dapper is the paper 10+ years ago, the world changed for a long time, APM vendors and industry have a very clear conclusion, if you want to analysis topology and metrics in high performance from the tracing, Dapper-similar data format(Zipkin, Jaeger, anything) is not enough.\r\n\r\nIf you want to understand the real world, read the STAM paper, https://wu-sheng.github.io/STAM/, which is a thing designed for 2020, rather than 2000.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/886676319/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":2},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/886686760","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/7374#issuecomment-886686760","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/7374","id":886686760,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArmls8402cQo","user":{"login":"chenhaipeng","id":6678954,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2Nzg5NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6678954?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhaipeng","html_url":"https://github.com/chenhaipeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhaipeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhaipeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhaipeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhaipeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhaipeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhaipeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhaipeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhaipeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhaipeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-26T13:07:20Z","updated_at":"2021-07-26T13:07:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @chenhaipeng\r\n> From your description, I got you mean that you want java, go, python, etc application to report data to skywalking, for that point, skywalking provided those languages agent or sdk. you can find it in https://skywalking.apache.org/docs/.\r\n> \r\n> As you mentioned opentelemetry protocol, that would be another discussion, right?\r\n\r\nThank you for the answers from the two above.
