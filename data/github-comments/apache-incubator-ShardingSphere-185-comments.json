,I checked many times, all the sql statements are SELECT, and the initial value are unique, when I use primary key in sharding table, `Unique index or primary key violation: \"PRIMARY KEY ON PUBLIC.\"\"t_order_calcite_sharding_0\"\"(\"\"order_id_sharding\"\")` are as still, but I didn't insert duplicate value of `order_id_sharding` column, and when I run single test method are ok, but when all tests method run together, this problem happens, and every single test method are INSERT type, It seems like doesn't produce duplicate value of `t_order_calcite_sharding_0`. So I don't know how does this happened.

Nice!\r\nActually, it is challenging to visit out the corresponding `SQLStatement`. Anyway, we can firstly fill some necessary `Segment`s into the target `SQLStatement`.\r\n\r\nHere is another issue needing your attention.\r\n\r\nCould you figure out whether there are similar `MERGE` SQL definitions in other databases, like `SQLServer`, `SQL92`?\r\n\r\nThe reason is that I found you created an abstract class, `MergeStatement`. Generally, an abstract class `MergeStatement` is designed to imply that there will be many final child classes from various databases, like the `OracleMergeStatement` class from you.\r\n\r\nSo if `MERGE` SQL is specific to `Oracle`, it is suggested to remove abstract `MergeStatement`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/792275813/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/792396437","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/pull/9603#issuecomment-792396437","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/9603","id":792396437,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5MjM5NjQzNw==","user":{"login":"wgy8283335","id":22066046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDY2MDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22066046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgy8283335","html_url":"https://github.com/wgy8283335","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgy8283335/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgy8283335/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgy8283335/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgy8283335/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgy8283335/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgy8283335/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgy8283335/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgy8283335/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgy8283335/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-08T01:06:23Z","updated_at":"2021-03-08T01:06:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Should
