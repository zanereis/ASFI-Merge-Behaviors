I've also included a diagram of the java implementation.\r\n\r\n- Catalog abstraction\r\n  - Operations\r\n    - List tables\r\n    - Create a table\r\n    - Drop a table\r\n    - Replace table\r\n    - Load table (returns an instance of the main table class that users will interact with)\r\n    - Rename a table\r\n    - Check that a table exists (or maybe this is done in load table. Python users will be familiar with `try catalog.load_table() except MissingTableException`)\r\n- Table identifier (maybe not needed?)\r\n  - In python, a table identifier could just be a string and the main Table class itself could also serve as the table identifier. `Table(“foo.bar.baz”, catalog=Catalog(...))` or `Table(namespace=”foo”, database=”bar”, table=”baz”, catalog=Catalog(...))`. Loading the table from the catalog would then be `Table.load()`.\r\n  - “Loading a table” from the catalog could easily be confused with loading the actual data. Since we’ll have both of these functionalities in a single library, should we have a more explicit class name here so it’s not confused with whatever the particular in-memory table format is that’s being used, i.e. pyarrow.Table, pandas.DataFrame, numpy.ndarray, etc.? Some options:\r\n    - IcebergTable\r\n    - TableMetadata\r\n    - TableInfo\r\n- Namespace: Does this need to be a class? Can the `catalog.listNamespaces` method just take a string as an argument?\r\n- Should the JDBC catalog implementation be ranked higher in priority than the hive catalog?\r\n\r\nJava implementation:\r\n\r\n![catalog](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43911210/152832960-77afbccd-02f3-456e-8863-bd8988d02afe.png)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1031682350/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1031695082","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/3245#issuecomment-1031695082","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3245","id":1031695082,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX849fmrq","user":{"login":"cccs-eric","id":56447460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NDQ3NDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56447460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cccs-eric","html_url":"https://github.com/cccs-eric","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cccs-eric/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cccs-eric/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cccs-eric/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cccs-eric/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cccs-eric/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cccs-eric/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cccs-eric/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cccs-eric/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cccs-eric/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-07T16:58:47Z","updated_at":"2022-02-07T16:58:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@samredai Is there a plan to support a filesystem-based catalog?

You view engine.hive.enabled as a property of the Hive environment, and see it as related to Iceberg classes being available on the classpath. I view engine.hive.enabled as a property of the table, as I view whether or not a table is Hive-enabled to be a trait of the table rather than of the Hive environment. Thus I do not see having the property in the table as \"leaking Hive environment\". Thus my proposal to write engine.hive.enabled in the table properties when it is created (not \"from some point in time\") if it is created a being Hive-enabled.\r\nFrom what I observe, as a Spark user, I have been able to create, read and write Hive-enabled Iceberg tables without having the Hive Iceberg StorageHandler, SerDe, InputFormat and OutputFormat classes in my classpath; I only need the Iceberg Spark runtime jar in my classpath. So I don't think of whether a table is Hive-enabled or not as tied to my environment and classpath.\r\nThe way we encountered this issue is in a setting where we have a shared HMS, and where I create an Iceberg table using Spark (with iceberg.engine.hive.enabled=true in my conf, as we want to create Hive-enabled tables for interop with Hive). There is no Hive on this cluster. In a different cluster, we have Hive. iceberg.engine.hive.enabled is not set in the environment of this Hive cluster (so it defaults to false), as there did not seem to be a need for it. @pvary or @mbod can speak to the Hive side, since I'm not knowledgeable about it, but I believe that when you create an Iceberg table using Hive QL, then Hive creates it with engine.hive.enabled=true in the properties. It's just that when Spark created the table, it doesn't write engine.hive.enabled=true in the properties (which is what this change fixes). Hive can read the Iceberg table Spark created (because HMS says it has the Iceberg StorageHandler, SerDe, Input/OutputFormat), but if it updates it, in `HiveTableOperations#doCommit`, `hiveEngineEnabled` will be false, so the table is turned into a non-Hive-enabled table (the table will then no longer have the Iceberg StorageHandler, SerDe, Input/OutputFormat), and Hive won't be able to read it after that. We could also have a situation where Spark, in another cluster where iceberg.engine.hive.enabled is not set in the conf), updates the table, and that would also turn a Hive-enabled table into a non-Hive-enabled table if we don't have engine.hive.enabled=true in the table properties.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1032165351/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1032171908","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3975#issuecomment-1032171908","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3975","id":1032171908,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX849hbGE","user":{"login":"wuwenchi","id":19755729,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzU1NzI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19755729?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwenchi","html_url":"https://github.com/wuwenchi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwenchi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwenchi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwenchi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwenchi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwenchi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwenchi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwenchi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwenchi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwenchi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-08T03:19:20Z","updated_at":"2022-02-08T03:19:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"cc @RussellSpitzer  thanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1032171908/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1032303260","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4062#issuecomment-1032303260","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4062","id":1032303260,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX849h7Kc","user":{"login":"jackye1995","id":29823233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODIzMjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29823233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995","html_url":"https://github.com/jackye1995","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-08T07:45:05Z","updated_at":"2022-02-08T07:45:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Did a direct copy using:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncp -r ../iceberg-docs/docs/content/docs documentation/versioned\r\ncp -r ../iceberg-docs/landing-page/content/common documentation/common\r\n```\r\n\r\nLicense missing for all redirect files:\r\n\r\n```\r\n !?????

@rdblue, I think the problem is that we request a hash distribution by `_file` and sometimes records for multiple files end up in a single output task. That leads to an inconsistent number of output files. It used to happen frequently when we had only 4 shuffle partitions but then I changed it to 200. Looks like this is still not enough and we should come up with a more reliable fix.\r\n\r\n```\r\n// set the num of shuffle partitions to 200 instead of default 4 to reduce the chance of hashing\r\n// records for multiple source files to one writing task (needed for a predictable num of output files)\r\nwithSQLConf(ImmutableMap.of(SQLConf.SHUFFLE_PARTITIONS().key(), \"200\"), () -> {\r\n  sql(\"UPDATE %s SET id = -1\", tableName);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet me see the PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1032851191/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1032851664","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4009#issuecomment-1032851664","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4009","id":1032851664,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX849kBDQ","user":{"login":"fqaiser94","id":20507243,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTA3MjQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20507243?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fqaiser94","html_url":"https://github.com/fqaiser94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fqaiser94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fqaiser94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fqaiser94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fqaiser94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fqaiser94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fqaiser94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fqaiser94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fqaiser94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fqaiser94/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-08T17:06:17Z","updated_at":"2022-02-08T17:06:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rdblue all comments addressed, can you give the CI a bump once more please?

A couple observations:\r\n\r\n1. I'm not sure if we want to include this in the core library (I think @kbendick  made the same observation).  One option might actually be to put this implementation into the test src so that there isn't confusion around the fact that this is intended for for test use only (i.e. It's not a supported Catalog/FileIO for production use).  Projects that want to use this implementation just need to depend on the test artifact to get access (a good example is the `iceberg-data` project).\r\n2. Even though we have concurrent collections, there are a fair number of places where we're doing checks/changes without synchronizing on the collection, so there are race conditions (I pointed out the `renameTable`, but there are many others and I believe even the table ops commit is not atomic.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1033136607/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1033152659","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3697#issuecomment-1033152659","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3697","id":1033152659,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX849lKiT","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-08T23:09:44Z","updated_at":"2022-02-08T23:09:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I don't see a real need to rewrite existing classes that don't change much.

am not sure how useful a table property is or whether we should even make it configurable. Specifically, I am worried about adding a rarely used table property. We are usually pretty conservative when it comes to adding new table properties. Is there a good use case for this to be configurable? It seems that if anyone needs to tune the metrics config, the existing framework is already good enough and allows us to set default and per-column modes. I think we should encourage users to set that.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think 100 is too big. I'd prefer it to be around 24-32. I've seen tables with 100 string columns and the metadata size already had an impact on the performance. Any thoughts on that?

I took time to make sure I am thinking with general Iceberg mindset, below please find my responses. If they make sense, I will go ahead and update the specs accordingly.\r\nLet me start with the example you wrote:\r\n> An example being:\r\n> \r\n> Say I have file A' without column id 3 which has a default in my spec of \"foo\". If I read rows out of fileA' with this schema do I return foo? If I later read the table where the spec has a default for column3 of \"bar\" do I read bar? If I rewrite the datafiles inbetween the schema changes do I get foo or bar or null?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe default value is part of the table’s schema/spec.  Hence, it lives in the Iceberg Metadata file. Therefore, whenever the schema is updated, leading to a new Schema ID,  successor reads will read the new value. If however reading an older snapshot, i.e., using the older Snapshot Schema, the older default value saved in that older Schema will be used. \r\nSo, in the example you listed, reading file-A first time (snapshot 0) will return value “foo”, while reading it after updating the spec/schema (new Snapshot 1) will read “bar” (but of course reading snapshot 0 even after updating the schema will still read “foo”)..\r\nRewriting datafiles produces a new snapshot, which derives from the latest snapshot, with its same schema, so it is sort of orthogonal in the sense that the reading behavior is the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> For example, does a writer upon rewriting a file with a default value set, materialize that value?\r\n\r\nNo. Default values belong to the table’s spec/schema, and are used only when reading and the column is missing (not materialized)\r\n\r\n\r\n> I think \"manifested\" needs explanation as well. If defaults are used on writers I think we probably need to explain that in the writer section.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgreed, will use “materialized” instead. Also, defaults are not used in writes (of datafiles). However, it worth mentioning that we might consider adding a DDL to ALTER column adding/changing/dropping default values, if fits. Such DDLs would create a new schema in the metadata file, and a new Snapshot.\r\n\r\n\r\n> A field is required and has a default value, What does this mean on writing/rewriting + reading. \r\n\r\nDefault values are used only during reading data. When a data row is missing a column id that has a default value, the default value (from the schema) is read/used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n>What happens if this default is changed in the schema but the column id remains the same.\r\n\r\nThis is the default case, right? The opposite case is interesting: if column id is changed, I am not sure what does that even mean? Column is deleted and a new one with the same column name is introduced? In any case, the default value defined for column X in the schema will only be used with the X's column id.\r\n\r\n\r\n> \r\n> A field is optional and has a default value, What does this mean on writing/rewriting + reading. What happens if this default is changed ...\r\n\r\n\r\nOptional vs Required makes difference if no default value is defined, while reading data. If a default value is defined in and the column id is missing, the default value is used in both cases (i.e., optional and required fields cases). If no default value is defined, then an exception is thrown only if the field is required. For reference: https://github.com/linkedin/iceberg/pull/72/files#diff-40083c166e284232643fa343534c626bca09d488537c226bb324be6169cab571R109 \r\n\r\n\r\n> \r\n> Can a default valued field be applied to files where the column ID of the field is not present? \r\n\r\nif I read this correctly, the question is: if table had columns A and B, and we have datafile1 written. Then later we add column X with default value d_x. Can we read the default value while reading datafile1? The answer is yes. In fact, this support for non-null default values was motivated to address this scenario particularly. \r\n\r\n> I believe this is part of the idea here but i'm not sure how it would be defined. Is the idea that if the column ID is not present in a given data file do we always just return the default of the current schema?\r\n\r\nCorrect (where current = schema of the snapshot we are reading)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> Do defaults exist retroactively or are they always forward looking?\r\n\r\nDefaults can exist retroactively, since we can read older data files using newer snapshots’ schemata.. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1034297274/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1034367518","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3988#issuecomment-1034367518","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3988","id":1034367518,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX849pzIe","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-10T00:51:07Z","updated_at":"2022-02-10T00:51:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks, @cccs-eric!
