@mistercrunch, I looked into removing blank filters from the `addFilter` function in Dashboard.jsx. I'll add that in once @graceguo-supercat gets her Dashboard refactor in.\r\n\r\nWhen I was testing it seems there was still a problem where getExploreUrl was getting called with an old version of `preselect_filters` in superset.js (and was adding empty filters as a result). I'll look into that after the Dashboard refactor.\r\n\r\nSo it seems like I'll close this PR and solve this problem in followup prs unless anyone objects.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/341824381/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/341829716","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/3754#issuecomment-341829716","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/3754","id":341829716,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MTgyOTcxNg==","user":{"login":"TryHarder01","id":4213036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTMwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4213036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TryHarder01","html_url":"https://github.com/TryHarder01","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TryHarder01/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TryHarder01/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TryHarder01/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TryHarder01/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TryHarder01/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TryHarder01/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TryHarder01/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TryHarder01/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TryHarder01/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-03T21:17:59Z","updated_at":"2017-11-03T21:17:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"do a `pip freeze` to see what version cx_oracle you have...\r\n\r\ninstall 5.3 specifically by running\r\n\r\n`pip install cx_oracle==5.3`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/341829716/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/341833452","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/3772#issuecomment-341833452","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/3772","id":341833452,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MTgzMzQ1Mg==","user":{"login":"xrmx","id":12932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx","html_url":"https://github.com/xrmx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-03T21:36:50Z","updated_at":"2017-11-03T21:36:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think you too have missed that superset is not supported on windows.
