think we can have the best of both worlds here guys.  If we create a filter like\n\n```\n{ type: \"whereClause\",\n  \"where\": \"x = billy OR (x = sally and y = 1)\" }\n```\n\nAnd then we add a new `QueryRunner` that checks the filter set for instances of the \"whereClause\" filter and rewrites it into objects like \"not\", \"selector\", \"bounds\", etc. then we can have both worlds.  Downstream logic can be implemented assuming a structured set of objects defining the filter, and we can also support more human-friendly filter
