With the current API the original key would either be dropped if a complete new group-by key is selected, or it must be embedded into the selected group-by key since the value field is not changed at all.\n\nThere is still work-around about this though, e.g. users could call `stream.map(/* duplicate the key as part of the value field*/).groupBy(/* choose a new key*/)`. So it maybe OK as well.
