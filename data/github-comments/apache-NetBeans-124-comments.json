No `ArtifactSpec` structures are created in advance and the graph contains target GradleDependency instances, which are created already anyway. The tree is made only when someone asks for the DependencyResult.

Here some of my thoughts why I made this target NB 15 during rc phase and why I haven't tried anything beyond breaking up quadratic complexity (its connected):\r\n\r\n- easily avoidable quadratic complexity is a performance defect IMO, which should be seen the same as a bug. Since this could be reduced to linear so easily after finding what it is, its also easy reviewable and a candidate for inclusion in NB 15 IMO.\r\n- completion for the synthetic test of 10k fields and methods improved from unusable to instantly already with this fix (try it)\r\n- building HahsMaps/Sets takes CPU time too, so this would need more measurements and I also wanted to propose this PR quickly and it had to be simple as possible. (edit: there would be also the risk to optimize for unrealistic synthetic scenarios, e.g if i would have increased field/method count further beyond 10k)\r\n- anything more difficult to review should be targeted for NB 16, with measurements showing that it is worth building a hashmap (anyone is welcome to do that)\r\n\r\nso if anyone is reviewing this: please concentrate on correctness. Further improvements would be for 16.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1214347659/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1214368761","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/4502#issuecomment-1214368761","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4502","id":1214368761,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5IYcv5","user":{"login":"tonihele","id":8344766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNDQ3NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8344766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonihele","html_url":"https://github.com/tonihele","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonihele/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonihele/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonihele/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonihele/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonihele/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonihele/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonihele/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonihele/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonihele/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-14T12:54:06Z","updated_at":"2022-08-14T12:54:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Yeah, don't mind me too much.
