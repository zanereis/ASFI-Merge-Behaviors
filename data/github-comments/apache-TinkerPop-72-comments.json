the memory, for Aerospike Graph after a few mins we see about 1 GB total if the bug is not present, if the bug is present I see ~1 GB per minute growth and will see ~3-4 GB at the end of the test. \r\n\r\nThis is kind of obvious, but make sure the evaluationTimeout in the server yaml is big (mine was 20 mins).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1587954864/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1589525823","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2092#issuecomment-1589525823","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/2092","id":1589525823,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc5evj0_","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-13T15:17:54Z","updated_at":"2023-06-13T15:28:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"##
