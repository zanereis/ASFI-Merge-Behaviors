The ansible roles for kafka and zookeeper were not correct and did not preserve the semantics of [isAlive](https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk/blob/master/tools/health/isAlive). This caused some combination of zookeeper/kafka misconfiguration that surfaces in the invoker with the symptom described above. This symptom seems to resolve itself after several minutes. We have not yet completely explained the issue but restoring `isAlive` semantics is important.\n\nThe reason this symptom does not surface in Travis CI or local tests (unless you repeat the steps outlined above) is that there are several minutes worth of tests that run before the first test that required the invoker to be involved.\n\nAll roles should be checked for semantic equivalence with `isAlive`. @psuter and I fixed the two immediate ones that are impacting/blocking work related to streaming db support (needed for zip file uploads and the like). You should verify the other components are not equally giving false positive \"is alive\" responses.\n\n`consul` alive check is affected by this as well - possibly others. I defer to you to investigate further.\n\nFYI @jeremiaswerner \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/227548920/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/227551093","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/722#issuecomment-227551093","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/722","id":227551093,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNzU1MTA5Mw==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-21T19:48:49Z","updated_at":"2016-06-21T19:48:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@domdom82 @lehoanganh please review.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/227551093/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/227552232","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/719#issuecomment-227552232","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/719","id":227552232,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNzU1MjIzMg==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-21T19:52:59Z","updated_at":"2016-06-21T19:52:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@nwspeete-ibm this is related to the push notification package.
