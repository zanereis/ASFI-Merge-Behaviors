\r\n> is this issue related to this #3348 ?\r\n\r\nI don't see any specific change in #3348 which can cause this issue. it seems broker is not able to fetch topics-list from other broker that owns specific bundle and then it's timing out. I tried to start pulsar cluster with 3 brokers and I am able to get successful response for` ./pulsar-admin non-persistent list public/default`\r\n\r\nDo you see any errors at broker log? or can you share the thread-dump of the broker which actually owns the topic?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/468051066/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/468088403","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/3630#issuecomment-468088403","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/3630","id":468088403,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2ODA4ODQwMw==","user":{"login":"rdhabalia","id":2898254,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTgyNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2898254?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia","html_url":"https://github.com/rdhabalia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-28T00:36:56Z","updated_at":"2019-02-28T00:36:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Consumer creation and closing are repeated many times in parallel using the WebSocket API\r\n\r\nyes, this happens when cache gets expired (after 5 mins) and at the same time many, threads tries to access the same key from the cache (so, it mainly occurs while adding-consumer which requires to to access global-zk cache).

actually it was a part of the plan as @merlimat suggested :https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/538#discussion_r129182185\r\nwhen we introduced this non-persistent feature to remove this config and created issue #596 to track it.\r\nThe main argument @merlimat had that isolating based on topic-types did not work well in jms/activeMQ and if n/w bandwidth is the concern then it can be achieved with namespace isolation without impacting other tenants. also, broker doesn't allow more than 1K pending publish req per cnx to throttle on each cnx. so, decided to remove this config once feature is matured and if it's not being used.
