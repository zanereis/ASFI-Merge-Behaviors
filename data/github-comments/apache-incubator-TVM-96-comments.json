It uses `tvm::if_then_else` (https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/master/topi/include/topi/transform.h#L338), which cannot be vectorized. Writing a separate schedule for concat doesn't completely solve the problem because concat is marked as injective op and once it's fused with other injective ops, the fused_op is scheduled with the injective schedule instead of the concat schedule. One temporary solution is to remove vectorization from the injective schedule, which is not optimal. Another solution is to fix the `if_then_else` problem, which isn't quite obvious to me.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/486001464/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/486025771","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/3079#issuecomment-486025771","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3079","id":486025771,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NjAyNTc3MQ==","user":{"login":"jroesch","id":696509,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjUwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/696509?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch","html_url":"https://github.com/jroesch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-24T00:51:32Z","updated_at":"2019-04-24T00:51:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Which versions are you using?

Specifically:\r\n\r\n1. Should I raise an error if `groups` is larger than either chunk size (`ic_chunk`, `oc_chunk`)?\r\n2. I tried to reduce the group size in the test case as well, but the final result is wrong compared with the golden value from `topi.testing.conv2d_nchw_python`.

The library contains arbitrary floats (including bfloat16), arbitrary posits, valids, and small unum type IIs. As a 'runtime' it expands the TVM capability to do multi-precision DL algorithm research. So it is not so much about the data type for TVM, it is about the capability to properly compare a range of arithmetic systems and their impact on learning rate, accuracy, and recall.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/487038754/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/487047157","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3020#issuecomment-487047157","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3020","id":487047157,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NzA0NzE1Nw==","user":{"login":"vinx13","id":7195739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxOTU3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7195739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13","html_url":"https://github.com/vinx13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-26T12:57:12Z","updated_at":"2019-04-26T12:57:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@Wheest The NCHWc template that uses tensorization is only for CUDA.
