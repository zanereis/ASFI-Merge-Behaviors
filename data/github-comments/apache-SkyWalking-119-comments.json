Old analysis, `zipkin span -> skywalking segment` should be removed, not stable and much useful.\r\n1. OAL analysis engineer and source definitions are there and making analysis much easier. You just need to assemble the source(s) and send it to the dispatcher.\r\n\r\n> The only thing left behind is how to guarantee that all the span information are sent to the same OAP node?
