When I opened this up to the community to discuss, my read of the conversation was that since non-parallel export/import can work with a directory, it would be better to have it available to both. In addition, while we have not added the ability yet to export all regions at once, that is possible to do and could be added as a feature and would require a directory to be provided instead of a file, for both parallel and non-parallel export. How to implement the options was definitely an area of mixed opinions on multiple options, so still an area worth discussing to make sure we get to the best solution.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/326435188/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/326784540","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/245#issuecomment-326784540","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/245","id":326784540,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNjc4NDU0MA==","user":{"login":"jake-at-work","id":6800791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MDA3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6800791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work","html_url":"https://github.com/jake-at-work","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-03T04:58:38Z","updated_at":"2017-09-03T04:58:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing

Geode-junit doesn't end up in $GEODE_HOME/lib, so I think that behavior is expected.  \r\n\r\nThe way I envision this rule to be used is one of the following:\r\n1) For use inside of Geode (i.e. tests inside of geode-assembly), the Gradle build sets $GEODE_HOME to point at geode-assembly/build/install/apache-geode.\r\n2) For external users, get the geode-junit jar through gradle/maven, and have $GEODE_HOME set to point at an existing Geode installation.\r\n3) For external users, get the geode-junit jar through gradle/maven in addition to the full apache-geode distribution zip file from our snapshot repo.  I'm planning to write a Gradle task (doesn't exist yet) that will extract that distribution zip and set $GEODE_HOME to the expanded location (similar to what happens in 1 for internal usage).\r\n\r\nI should note that 2 & 3 are certainly experimental at this time.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/329620630/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/329629625","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/784#issuecomment-329629625","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/784","id":329629625,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyOTYyOTYyNQ==","user":{"login":"PurelyApplied","id":7175687,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNzU2ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7175687?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PurelyApplied","html_url":"https://github.com/PurelyApplied","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PurelyApplied/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PurelyApplied/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PurelyApplied/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PurelyApplied/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PurelyApplied/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PurelyApplied/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PurelyApplied/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PurelyApplied/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PurelyApplied/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-14T22:48:13Z","updated_at":"2017-09-14T22:48:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"precheckin running.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/329629625/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/329633839","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/755#issuecomment-329633839","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/755","id":329633839,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyOTYzMzgzOQ==","user":{"login":"pivotal-amurmann","id":19393329,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzkzMzI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19393329?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pivotal-amurmann","html_url":"https://github.com/pivotal-amurmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pivotal-amurmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pivotal-amurmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pivotal-amurmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pivotal-amurmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pivotal-amurmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pivotal-amurmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pivotal-amurmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pivotal-amurmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pivotal-amurmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-14T23:13:34Z","updated_at":"2017-09-14T23:13:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@galen-pivotal @bschuchardt All your concerns that are addressable should now be addressed.
