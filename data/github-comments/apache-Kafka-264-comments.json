the general issue that it may get exposed: I think the root cause is in `CoordinatorResponseHandler#onFailure()` we only mark the coordinator as dead but do not do anything else; for example for `syncGroupRequest`, and then in its caller `joinGroupIfNeeded()`, we do not check the `DisconnectException` again, and the while condition `needRejoin() || rejoinIncomplete()` will also pass although the actual state is:\r\n\r\n1. `state = MemberState.UNJOINED`.\r\n2. `coordinator = null`.\r\n3. `rejoinNeeded = false`.\r\n4. `joinFuture = null`.\r\n\r\nI think we should check all four variables

I actually think it helps to leave open the _option_ of directly producing to internal topics. While it is true that a user could send an `OffsetCommitRequest`, we have in the past also used the facility to emit tombstones.

So in short, IMO I don't think this backdoor should be removed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/305393622/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/305394053","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/3131#issuecomment-305394053","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/3131","id":305394053,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNTM5NDA1Mw==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-01T05:38:22Z","updated_at":"2017-06-01T05:38:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer

Epochs do not wrap-around. If you reach the limit, you must get a new transactionalId. We can probably make the clear with an EPOCH_OVERFLOW error in InitProducerId. The nice thing about this approach is that it does not risk violating correctness.\r\n2. We could pass through some additional information from the TC when the epoch is generated. For example, we could return the coordinator epoch. The producer could then pass that through in the ProduceRequest and we could use it to detect when an epoch has legitimately wrapped around. This is probably a bit more work than we can get away with this late in the game.\r\n\r\nI think I'm actually leaning toward the first option as opposed to the current patch, which will be difficult to explain to users. In the next release, we can try to provide a more graceful way to handle the problem such as perhaps the second option. I think we expect that this will be pretty rare in practice anyway.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/305412443/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/305414683","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/3183#issuecomment-305414683","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/3183","id":305414683,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNTQxNDY4Mw==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-01T07:39:46Z","updated_at":"2017-06-01T07:39:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer to this link for build results (access rights to CI server needed): \nhttps://builds.apache.org/job/kafka-pr-jdk7-scala2.11/4708/\nTest PASSed (JDK 7 and Scala 2.11).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/305414683/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/305418937","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/3183#issuecomment-305418937","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/3183","id":305418937,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNTQxODkzNw==","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-01T07:58:19Z","updated_at":"2017-06-01T07:58:19Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think option 1 seems reasonable for this release.
