What's the order for Pulsar, when we disable forced fsync (and also when its on)?\r\n\r\npulsar's replication mechanism is handled by bookkeeper. bookkeeper is using a parallel replication scheme.

difference between fsync enabled and fsync disabled is that:\r\n\r\n- fsync enabled: bookie sends responses back to brokers when it successfully writes data to filesystem and the data is fsynced to

and @srkukarni Firstly, thanks for reviews.\r\n\r\n**1-** Yep, i think about Pulsar both `Source` and `Sink` connectors for `Tcp`, `Udp` and `Http` protocols. On the other hand, i was also thinking where these connectors can sit ideally such as:\r\n- `pulsar-core` level (if the user does not use Pulsar Functions and need to work with `Tcp`, `Udp` and `Http`. Also, he can still apply Pulsar functions on related topic) or \r\n- `pulsar-io` level (if the user needs to use Pulsar functions, this connectors can be moved into `pulsar-io` by implementing `org.apache.pulsar.io.core.PushSource` and `Sink` Interfaces). \r\n\r\nSo, this is also open question for me and we can make decision.\r\n\r\n**Sample Use Cases:**\r\nhttps://netty.io/wiki/adopters.html (Netty Use Cases)\r\nhttps://keyholesoftware.com/2016/05/24/whirlpool-microservices-using-netty-and-kafka/\r\nhttp://bahir.apache.org/docs/flink/current/flink-streaming-netty/\r\n\r\n**2-** *Knative:* I think Knative support can be a required feature. As a sample high level Pulsar pipeline on Knative:\r\n```\r\nSource(Pulsar Event / Other Source Events(Pulsar IO Source)) -> Channel (Pulsar Channel) --Subscription--> Service (Pulsar Functions -> Sink(e.g: Tcp/Udp/Http)))\r\n```\r\n- Native Pulsar Support on `Knative Repo` can be useful for specially `PulsarSource` and `PulsarChannel` (as persistent). On the other hand, `Service`(Pulsar Function)) layer can be user-driven.\r\n- `Pulsar Functions / IO Sinks` can need to be supported as `runnable` and `deployable` (through Docker in order to be managed functions' lifecycle through pods)\r\n\r\nAlso, `Knative Support` can be separated `PIP`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/443419883/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/443438794","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/3104#issuecomment-443438794","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/3104","id":443438794,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MzQzODc5NA==","user":{"login":"merlimat","id":62500,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat","html_url":"https://github.com/merlimat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-01T16:35:50Z","updated_at":"2018-12-01T16:35:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@cbornet I think this could be achieved even today (this time for real :) ).\r\n\r\nThere is a concept of \"namespace isolation\".

the conversation from slack to here. I think the main problem is the deployment was changed to using statefulset deployment, but it still using `hostIp` as the advertised address. It is a problem of documentation. I would update the documentation to address it.\r\n\r\n```\r\nsijieg [9:05 AM]\r\n@paultjuh looks like the issue is because you were trying to change a daemon set k8s deployment to a statefulset deployment, but still using hostIp as the advertised  address.\r\n\r\nFYI. Generic is for daemonset deployment because it is assuming there is no PVs available in a generic deployment; if you want to use a statefulset deployment, a cloud one like GKE is better to use or modify.\r\n\r\nI will take a closer look at your issue though.\r\n\r\n\r\npaultjuh [9:32 AM]\r\nYeah, I realize that now.  I don't think the hostIp is needed though (edited)\r\n\r\nivan [9:46 AM]\r\npodIp should work for both cases. or hostnameAsBookieId\r\n\r\npaultjuh [10:09 AM]\r\nwithout picking it up manually it also works as far as I know\r\n\r\nsijieg [10:12 AM]\r\nWell, that’s not true. The principle is using stable identifier for your bookkeeper deployment. In daemonset, only hostIp is a stable identifier to use; while in statefulset, the pod hostname is the one to use.\r\nUsing podIp is not correct for bookkeeper deployment\r\nPodIP changes when the pod restarts\r\nThe suggestion of using PodIP is misleading\r\nThe problem of using PodIP only occurs after you restart pods\r\n\r\npaultjuh [10:14 AM]\r\nah, my mistake\r\nI'm not sure if there is anything against a statefulset with a preferred anti-affinity set\r\nor it might be good to document(maybe with comments in the yaml), why certain things are set like that\r\n\r\nsijieg [10:17 AM]\r\nI think there is one section documenting that\r\n\r\npaultjuh [10:17 AM]\r\nit would be helpful, as now with generic I expected get something similar as GKE, but instead it's pretty different (no persistent storage, no replication for bookies)\r\nDid I miss that?\r\n\r\nsijieg [10:18 AM]\r\nBK has its own replication. So there is no technical differences between statefulset and daemonset.\r\nStatefulSet is good for cloud or your K8 already have persistent volumes. But the downside is you have extra replication in persistent volumes\r\nDaemonset is good for a k8 cluster that doesn’t have persistent volumes.\r\n\r\npaultjuh [10:21 AM]\r\nok, that might make sense indeed\r\nalthough not sure if their would be many clusters without PV's\r\nusually there is some support available\r\nI can't find it in the docs though\r\n\r\nsijieg [10:22 AM]\r\nIn either deployment, the key is to choose an identifier as the bookie id, the identifier should not be changed upon pod restarts\r\nWhy the examples in generic is daemonset is because people typically use it for trying it out and customize to its own k8 deployment. In that way, using a daemonset for generic examples is making sense for most of k8 clusters\r\nLet me find the documentation when I am close to a laptop\r\n\r\npaultjuh [10:24 AM]\r\nthanks!\r\n\r\nsijieg [10:40 AM]\r\n@paultjuh - I think the documentation was in bookkeeper. http://bookkeeper.apache.org/docs/latest/deployment/kubernetes/#deploy-bookies I will update them to pulsar as well.\r\n\r\npaultjuh [10:41 AM]\r\nAh nice, thanks!\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/444211490/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/444213425","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/3119#issuecomment-444213425","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/3119","id":444213425,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NDIxMzQyNQ==","user":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-04T18:50:28Z","updated_at":"2018-12-04T18:50:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@cbornet
