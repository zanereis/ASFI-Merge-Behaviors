However entries created under it will be written by consumers them self and as long as they are using our libraries, it will use the same ZkUtil class and those entries will be secured so only consumers in same group with same identity will be able to write to them. Even though /consumer is open , as children are secured no user will be able to delete /consumer. \n\nI am not sure what you meant by use \"Zookeeper+and+SASL\" to strengthen security. This PR sets the correct acls and leaves what authentication scheme is used to client which they can control by specifying their preferred scheme(digest, sasl) in Client section of the jaas. We should not need to change anything in this PR to support SASL over
