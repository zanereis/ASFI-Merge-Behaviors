It seems like we're modifying a bunch of behavior around exceptions in public APIs (old consumer, simple consumer). Since we're throwing a completely different exception hierarchy and user code is probably going to be catching the old errors, isn't this going to break a ton of user code (and require major overhauls of any exception handling to compile against the new version)?\n\nI definitely like the idea of getting rid of huge swaths of redundant code, just not sure all the change here will be safe. Another intermediate step I could imagine working is to replace as much as possible in the server where it is safe, leave the existing exceptions in place just for the clients, and then we'll be setup to eventually remove the entire client code and exceptions whenever we deprecate and then remove the old clients.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/163436154/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/163437968","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/654#issuecomment-163437968","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/654","id":163437968,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MzQzNzk2OA==","user":{"login":"gwenshap","id":1189030,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODkwMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1189030?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap","html_url":"https://github.com/gwenshap","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-09T23:39:02Z","updated_at":"2015-12-09T23:39:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":":+1:\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/163437968/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/163439154","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/648#issuecomment-163439154","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/648","id":163439154,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MzQzOTE1NA==","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-09T23:46:09Z","updated_at":"2015-12-09T23:46:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ZoneMayor Thanks for looking into this.

I am not familiar with why we follow that approach instead of building a classpath that is appropriate to the class being started (ie the classpath for the project it is part of). @ewencp, do you know?\n\nWith the current approach, it's a bit hard to fix the issue (we can't filter duplicates trivially when constructing the classpath because we are relying on wildcards to build the classpath - in order not to exceed command-line length limits on certain platforms).\n\nWarnings:\n\n``` sh\nSLF4J: Found binding in [jar:file:/Users/ijuma/src/kafka/core/build/dependant-libs-2.10.6/slf4j-log4j12-1.7.10.jar!/org/slf4j/impl/StaticLoggerBinder.class]\nSLF4J: Found binding in [jar:file:/Users/ijuma/src/kafka/core/build/dependant-libs-2.10.6/slf4j-log4j12-1.7.6.jar!/org/slf4j/impl/StaticLoggerBinder.class]\nSLF4J: Found binding in [jar:file:/Users/ijuma/src/kafka/tools/build/dependant-libs-2.10.6/slf4j-log4j12-1.7.6.jar!/org/slf4j/impl/StaticLoggerBinder.class]\nSLF4J: Found binding in [jar:file:/Users/ijuma/src/kafka/connect/api/build/dependant-libs/slf4j-log4j12-1.7.6.jar!/org/slf4j/impl/StaticLoggerBinder.class]\nSLF4J: Found binding in [jar:file:/Users/ijuma/src/kafka/connect/runtime/build/dependant-libs/slf4j-log4j12-1.7.6.jar!/org/slf4j/impl/StaticLoggerBinder.class]\nSLF4J: Found binding in [jar:file:/Users/ijuma/src/kafka/connect/file/build/dependant-libs/slf4j-log4j12-1.7.6.jar!/org/slf4j/impl/StaticLoggerBinder.class]\nSLF4J: Found binding in [jar:file:/Users/ijuma/src/kafka/connect/json/build/dependant-libs/slf4j-log4j12-1.7.6.jar!/org/slf4j/impl/StaticLoggerBinder.class]\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/163705228/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/163710981","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/658#issuecomment-163710981","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/658","id":163710981,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MzcxMDk4MQ==","user":{"login":"MayureshGharat","id":4326831,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjY4MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4326831?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat","html_url":"https://github.com/MayureshGharat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-10T18:32:10Z","updated_at":"2015-12-10T18:32:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rajinisivaram thanks for the review.

There used to only be the one project, so everything was simple and we could use the standardized `kafka-run-class`. I think it continued to be used as we added more subprojects and just continued to accumulate code and CLASSPATHs to handle different projects. `kafka-run-class` does enough useful stuff that it'd be painful to maintain separate copies of it as they will diverge, we'd need to be very vigilant about applying fixes across all of them, etc.\n\nI think the best solution is probably to refactor the scripts so we can pull CLASSPATH setup to parent scripts, and in the few cases where it makes sense (e.g. the dozens of tools scripts), provide wrapper helper scripts, e.g. `kafka-tools-run-class` which is a small wrapper around `kafka-run-class` and allows us to keep all the tool-specific scripts simple.\n\nWrt dependencies, I think this is also due to the way we currently collect dependent libs. I'm honestly not sure how to do this better with gradle, but we need to sort out shared dependencies and be able to filter transitive dependencies that are already available elsewhere via the classpath.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/163713122/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/163715267","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/628#issuecomment-163715267","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/628","id":163715267,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MzcxNTI2Nw==","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-10T18:49:45Z","updated_at":"2015-12-10T18:49:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM.

The main reasons for adding this interface are the following:\n1. Windowed tables generated from a windowing definition cannot be directly written back to a Kafka topic: users have to decide either encode the window id into the key or value.\n2. We want to support a specific left join for windowed tables that allow shifting windows when joining two windowed tables, e.g. comparing the current aggregate results with history windowed aggregates a week ago.\n3. Stream to windowed-table join needs to be handled differently from stream to table join.\n\nAdmittedly adding this third class makes the whole DSL a bit too fat and cumbersome, but we have not came a better solution to the above three approaches. So feedbacks and thoughts on tangling the above three issues in order to simplify the APIs are more than welcomed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/163784876/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/163785275","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/656#issuecomment-163785275","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/656","id":163785275,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2Mzc4NTI3NQ==","user":{"login":"ewencp","id":47366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp","html_url":"https://github.com/ewencp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-10T23:27:28Z","updated_at":"2015-12-10T23:27:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/163785275/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/163787568","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/657#issuecomment-163787568","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/657","id":163787568,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2Mzc4NzU2OA==","user":{"login":"ewencp","id":47366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp","html_url":"https://github.com/ewencp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-10T23:40:42Z","updated_at":"2015-12-10T23:40:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@granders Love the goal of the patch, just have a few questions re: the implementation.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/163787568/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/163838515","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/666#issuecomment-163838515","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/666","id":163838515,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MzgzODUxNQ==","user":{"login":"hachikuji","id":12502538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAyNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12502538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji","html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-11T04:41:25Z","updated_at":"2015-12-11T04:41:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@guozhangwang Ping for review.
