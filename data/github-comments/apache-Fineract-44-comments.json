If the column documentTypeValue is meant to capture the issuing country for the document (which actually can make sense for all kinds of documents, not just passports), would it not make sense to call it that?

For example, if user selects drivers license, and enters 123456 for client X then later selects passport and enters 123456 then a validation errors shows up. \r\nbecause 123456 has been used already.\r\n\r\nCome to reality- In Africa where i have worked most of my life, as countries are fighting to reduce the financial exclusion percentages **(some countries are at 80% financial exclusion)**, **new / stringent KYC rules are being put in place**. For example in East and West Africa the central banks are pushing for one document only and that is the National ID. All other IDs are not allowed as KYC documents. Meanwhile, for Foreigners, only the Passport is recognized when opening a \"bank\" account in any bank of the hosting country.\r\n\r\nThis flexibility of various documents is being reduced to just National Id and Passports\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/1008603126/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/1008722767","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/1984#issuecomment-1008722767","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/1984","id":1008722767,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAuLPJ848H-NP","user":{"login":"rrpawar96","id":20750973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzUwOTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20750973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrpawar96","html_url":"https://github.com/rrpawar96","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrpawar96/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrpawar96/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrpawar96/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrpawar96/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrpawar96/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrpawar96/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrpawar96/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrpawar96/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrpawar96/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-10T10:16:59Z","updated_at":"2022-01-10T10:16:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> 2.

I would make that part (require HTTPS for REST calls) also configurable. I have something similar running in a modified version of Fineract that runs behind a proxy (NGinx); the proxy handles all the SSL related stuff... I think this is a quite common setup... and in my case I just wanted to save some CPU cycles (NGinx is - I think - faster and more flexible).\r\nI'll attack this PR again when I have the improved database configuration ready.\r\nThanks again for checking Petri.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/1019467036/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/1019797600","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/2023#issuecomment-1019797600","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/2023","id":1019797600,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAuLPJ848yOBg","user":{"login":"SubhamPramanik","id":22225798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjI1Nzk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22225798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SubhamPramanik","html_url":"https://github.com/SubhamPramanik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SubhamPramanik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SubhamPramanik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SubhamPramanik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SubhamPramanik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SubhamPramanik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SubhamPramanik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SubhamPramanik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SubhamPramanik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SubhamPramanik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-24T07:30:43Z","updated_at":"2022-01-24T07:45:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the insight.

While I was at it I introduced a mapping class for Fineract related properties (everything prefixed `fineract.*` in `application.properties`); those properties are mapped now to `org.apache.fineract.infrastructure.core.config.FineractProperties` for type safe access and avoiding all these `@Value(..)` annotations. Mapping the properties to a class also has advantages when doing configuration changes in a Kubernetes environment. The criteria I use to activate the backwards compatible configuration is a check on environment variable `fineract_tenants_driver` (if it's empty then the new configuration is assumed, if not empty then `org.apache.fineract.infrastructure.core.config.CompatibilityConfig` is activated. As we discussed: if the deprecated configuration is used then a warning is printed to the console.\r\n\r\nI've added some additional hints to the README and to docker-compose.yml. The Docker Compose file is configured to use the new stuff (with more options to tweak the Hikari pool configuration).\r\n\r\nI've tried both configs, work as advertised. Would be great if you could approve to get this stuff out of the way for the next release.
