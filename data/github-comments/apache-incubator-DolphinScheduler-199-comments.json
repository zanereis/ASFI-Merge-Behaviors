@caishunfeng @dailidong Another question related to this issue is how does ds deal with workers' logs? If not logging into remote storage, how do we keep large amount of logs produced by workers? Is there a best practice for this?\r\n\r\nNow DS doesn't specifically dealt with task log file, and the user handles it by himself, which is unfriendly.\r\nIt is a goold idea to write the task log into remote storage when keep running large amout tasks.  And I think the two point:\r\n\r\n1. How to write files? Specified by configuration or config in the process definition UI?\r\n2. How to read compatible local files and remote files?\r\n\r\n If you have some good idea, please let me know.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1053948453/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1053958658","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/8573#issuecomment-1053958658","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/8573","id":1053958658,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms4-0iIC","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-28T07:17:32Z","updated_at":"2022-02-28T07:17:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Search before asking\n\n- [X] I had searched in the [issues](https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues?q=is%3Aissue) and found no similar issues.\n\n\n### What happened\n\nCreate a new task in the web interface but can't delete it.
