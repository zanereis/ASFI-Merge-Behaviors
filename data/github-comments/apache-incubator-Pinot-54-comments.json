It may work for POC purpose, but maybe if we should think about how to structure the codes such that we can preserve the backward compatiliby of such logics. For example, we could implement these logics as a new pinotFS (local-disk/peer disk/etc) and add a new protocol (say, naming it as peer://..). With this change, we can move all of these extra logics to some separated class and plug them into pinot server if we desired to use this model while keeping the existing models work fine.\r\n\r\n2. extending the logics of segment completion protocols\r\nWe used to have deep storage to guarantee the safety of our data (multiple-replications of data in deep storage once commit is done). the new model seems to only have one copy of data once the segment commit is done. Are we going to work on this part and enhance our existing segment completion protocol so we can have more than one replica of data available before we decide a segment commit is finished? we should evaluate a couple of possible approaches and think about how to extend the segment completion protocols/managers to make this work\r\n\r\n3. coupling between pinot server components and tableDataManager\r\nIn this new change, we are adding more coupling between tableDataManager and pinot server with the new member such as helixAdmin or cluster name. We probably want to abstract those members out to some other components such that we can avoid the explicit coupling between two components. For example, we can create a class to pass that information around make different tableDataManager take in different implementation of such wrapper class so we can decouple multiple components.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/566793249/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/566814778","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/4937#issuecomment-566814778","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/4937","id":566814778,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NjgxNDc3OA==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-18T00:43:31Z","updated_at":"2019-12-18T02:53:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#

It may work for POC purpose, but maybe if we should think about how to structure the codes such that we can preserve the backward compatiliby of such logics. For example, we could implement these logics as a new pinotFS (local-disk/peer disk/etc) and add a new protocol (say, naming it as peer://..). With this change, we can move all of these extra logics to some separated class and plug them into pinot server if we desired to use this model while keeping the existing models work fine.\r\n\r\nThe design doc [https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/PINOT/By-passing+deep-store+requirement+for+Realtime+segment+completion](url) has a section discussing about back compatibility issues. In a high level, we will upgrade controller first with a new optional field to allow servers skip uploading segments. After that, we will perform the server upgrade.\r\n\r\n> 2. extending the logics of segment completion protocols\r\n>    We used to have deep storage to guarantee the safety of our data (multiple-replications of data in deep storage once commit is done). the new model seems to only have one copy of data once the segment commit is done. Are we going to work on this part and enhance our existing segment completion protocol so we can have more than one replica of data available before we decide a segment commit is finished? we should evaluate a couple of possible approaches and think about how to extend the segment completion protocols/managers to make this work\r\n\r\nThe current solution allows you either have 1 copy of segment data (if there is no configured deep storage) or more than 1 copy when a deep storage is configured.\r\n\r\n> 3. coupling between pinot server components and tableDataManager\r\n>    In this new change, we are adding more coupling between tableDataManager and pinot server with the new member such as helixAdmin or cluster name. We probably want to abstract those members out to some other components such that we can avoid the explicit coupling between two components. For example, we can create a class to pass that information around make different tableDataManager take in different implementation of such wrapper class so we can decouple multiple components.\r\n\r\nLet me look into this abstraction issue.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/568125409/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/568125831","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/4914#issuecomment-568125831","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/4914","id":568125831,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2ODEyNTgzMQ==","user":{"login":"chenboat","id":2549137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NDkxMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2549137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenboat","html_url":"https://github.com/chenboat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenboat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenboat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenboat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenboat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenboat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenboat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenboat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenboat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenboat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-20T23:37:31Z","updated_at":"2019-12-20T23:37:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Left some comments.

Specifically:\r\nI will add these details to the design doc.\r\n> \r\n> 1. The algorithm on the server side during commit.  Correct me if I am wrong, but I think you want to commit the metadata, and try uploading the segment to its destnation (whether pinot-fs or controller) in the background. Am I right? Or, is it that you attempt to upload the segment, and only if it fails, you commit the metadata and move on? (I think we should think through this, the latter seems better to me).\r\n\r\nThe codes tried the first approach: i.e., if the enableUploadToController is set as false, the server will first commit metadata to the controller, and if the commit is successful, do a background upload to the PinotFS.\r\n\r\n> 2. Document the error handling scenario. What happens when the segment upload fails but the commit succeeds ? (the use case for which we are building all this). What happens if another server gets a \"download\" but the committer has not gotten to ONLINE state yet? I think there are many states here that we need to design correctly.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/568131589/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/568154288","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/4941#issuecomment-568154288","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/4941","id":568154288,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2ODE1NDI4OA==","user":{"login":"kishoreg","id":850791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg","html_url":"https://github.com/kishoreg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-21T05:31:14Z","updated_at":"2019-12-21T05:31:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@Jackie-Jiang @mcvsubbu @mayankshriv and I discussed and came up with the following structure\r\n\r\n- pinot-plugins\r\n  - pinot-input-format\r\n    - pinot-avro\r\n    - pinot-csv\r\n    - pinot-json\r\n    - pinot-orc\r\n    - pinot-parquet\r\n    - pinot-thrift\r\n  - pinot-file-system\r\n    - pinot-adls\r\n    - pinot-hdfs\r\n    - pinot-gcs\r\n  - pinot-stream-ingestion\r\n    - pinot-kafka-0.9\r\n    - pinot-kafka-2.0\r\n    - pinot-kafka-base\r\n  - pinot-batch-ingestion\r\n    - v0_deprecated\r\n      - pinot-hadoop\r\n      - pinot-ingestion-common\r\n      - pinot-spark\r\n    - pinot-ingestion-base\r\n    - pinot-hadoop\r\n    - pinot-spark\r\n\r\nI will be making these changes over tomorrow.
