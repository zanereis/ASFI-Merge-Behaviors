executed in main thread. \r\nI've investigated it and found that this is because the expected number of messages is wrong in `MessageHandler`. I've created an issue for this ([REEF-1762](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/REEF-1762)), and PR for it (#1281). \r\n\r\nCould you please take a look at #1281 first?
