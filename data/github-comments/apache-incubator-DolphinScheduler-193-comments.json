Search before asking\n\n- [X] I had searched in the [issues](https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues?q=is%3Aissue) and found no similar feature requirement.\n\n\n### Description\n\n- Feature Scenario: \r\nWhen an exception occurs in the upstream task and needs to re-run complement, hope that can selete to re-run the dependent task automatically when cross DAG.\r\n\r\n- Analysis:\r\nNow  in DS, there are two dependent task types: DEPENDENT and SUB_PROCESS. SUB_PROCESS task can re-run when parent workflow execute, so what we need to support is the DEPENDENT task type.\r\n\r\n- Main idea:\r\n    - How to get the workflow relationship? Now there is no relation table of workflow, but you can use the `WorkFlowLineage`, see `WorkFlowLineageServiceImpl.queryWorkFlowLineage`\r\n    - The same time frequency, for example, DAG A1 schedule each hour, and the DAG B1 which use a DEPENDENT task B1.a1 to check A1.a1, the time frequency for the DEPENDENT task B1.a1  to check must be every hour. (If B1.a1 check each day, auto re-run will create many useless B1 process instances; But if you have a good idea, please say it)\r\n    - Dependent task should be the start task to re-run, if it has some front task, all these front tasks should be skip. \r\n\r\nChinese Translation:\r\n- 功能场景：\r\n当上游任务发生异常需要重新补数时，希望跨DAG的情况下可以选择自动触发下游任务补数。\r\n\r\n- 分析：\r\n现在在DS 中，有两种依赖任务类型：DEPENDENT 和 SUB_PROCESS。 SUB_PROCESS 任务可以在父工作流执行时重新运行，所以我们需要支持的是 DEPENDENT 任务类型。\r\n\r\n- 大致思路：\r\n    - 如何获得工作流关系？现在DS没有工作流的关系表，但是你可以借鉴`WorkFlowLineage`，见`WorkFlowLineageServiceImpl.queryWorkFlowLineage`\r\n    - 相同的时间频率，例如DAG A1调度每小时一次，DAG B1使用DEPENDENT任务B1.a1检查A1.a1，DEPENDENT任务B1.a1检查的时间频率必须是每小时。 （如果 B1.a1 每天检查一次，则自动触发下游补数会创建很多无用的 B1 流程实例；如果您有好的想法，请告诉我）\r\n    - 依赖任务应该是自动触发下游补数的开始节点，如果它有一些前置任务，则所有这些前置任务都应该跳过。\n\n### Use case\n\n_No response_\n\n### Related issues\n\n_No response_\n\n### Are you willing to submit a PR?\n\n- [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a
