In zero-elimination there are several internal analysis/transformations which are basically functions of the signature `ResType (Expr, Map<Var, Range>)`, and they could be added as subanalyses by using a simple adapter from such functions to analyses. However, it is probable that I'm missing the point.\r\n\r\nConcerning the usefulness of adding these transformations to the analyzer infrastructure, I should think a bit more on it. There are analyses like FreeVariables which are probably useful, there are transformations which are too zero-elimination-specific (like LiftNonzeronessConditions), and there are some transformations for which I'm not sure (like div/mod elimination).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/469828846/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/469887558","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2722#issuecomment-469887558","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2722","id":469887558,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2OTg4NzU1OA==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-05T22:40:08Z","updated_at":"2019-03-05T22:40:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks, @kazum @merrymercy @grwlf @sgrechanik-h for reviews, to collectivly answer some of the questions\r\n\r\n## Coverage of Testcases\r\n\r\nWe do not expect RewriteSimplifier to simplify all the possible cases. As a matter of fact, because most rewriting are **local** it is hard to get simplification over a long distance. This is a known limitation of the rewrite-based simplification. \r\n\r\nTo complement that, we will need a new simplification strategy: CanonicalSimplifier, which brings canonical form and will make it much easier to simplify cases like ```(x + y + z + x)=> x*2 + y + z```. However, there are cases that are covered by RewriteSimplifier which may not be covered by CanonicalSimplifiers, in particular, the rules wrt to max/mins.\r\n\r\nSo the goal of this PR is to get something that is correct and off the ground. We will continue to bring in new CanonicalSimplifier and improve both collectively.\r\n\r\n## Correctness\r\n\r\nCorrectness is a big problem for us, that is why we need test-coverage, and code reviews to review these rules. The general goal is to vet the rules explicitly. Again since many of the weights are going to be carried by CanonicalSimplifier, we do not need to have a comprehensive list of rules in here.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/469887558/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/469889626","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2738#issuecomment-469889626","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2738","id":469889626,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2OTg4OTYyNg==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-05T22:46:14Z","updated_at":"2019-03-05T22:46:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think a better solution is to move these tutorials into the correct places, in frontend, or the root.

I haven't noticed this notification. In my opinion, I agree the base pass node should be lightweight, However, we should have one mechanism to meet the situations we haven't considered. i.e. we should make it stable but flexible. For example, if we want to add the meta information some day in the future, how will we handle this situation? \r\n\r\nIf we don't have `PassInfo`, how do we distinguish `Pass` from `PassManager`?  LLVM's Pass has one method `lookupPassInfo` could do it. For LLVM, every pass will has one unique PassInfo (contains name , id and so on) and will be registered by `PassRegistry`, which could help to initialize pass initialization and resolve pass dependency.

Yes, this is possible.\r\n\r\n> * does div/mod fold  into Canonical/Rewrite Simplifier?\r\n\r\nDiv/mod elimination is not really a simplification, it is a transformation into a form which can be manipulated more easily by certain algorithms. So I don't think it should be a part of any simplifier. It's actually quite common: many transformations don't really simplify expressions in the usual sense.\r\n\r\n> * Reduction simplification might now go into the Simplifier as well now that we can define Visitors for Reduce.\r\n\r\nThis is possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nActually I have several doubts about the new Analyzer infrastructure that may be worth discussing, in particular:\r\n* The Analyzer class combines context tracking and managing subanalyzers. Or may be analyzers combine context tracking and analysis itself. I have a feeling that these things should be separated, although I may be wrong.\r\n* The notion of a subanalyzer is not very well defined.\r\n* It seems very hard to add a new subanalyzer: it seems to involve modifying several classes in several different places in a way that is very dependent on the particular analyzer, instead of just adding a class or a function to a list.\r\n* There is no example of memoization yet, and I'm not sure how it'll go. However, I believe that the problem of memoization should be separated from analysis/transformation itself, i.e. there should be some combinator to make arbitrary analysis memoized.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/470165711/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/470216963","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2353#issuecomment-470216963","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2353","id":470216963,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MDIxNjk2Mw==","user":{"login":"kevinthesun","id":15520525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTIwNTI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15520525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinthesun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-06T18:17:59Z","updated_at":"2019-03-06T18:17:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"There

You can still use some of that to test locally and find failure case to add to the CI.\r\n\r\nI will remove hypothesis for now, but it should be added back eventually.\r\n\r\n> I have seen ;`` as separators, can we remove the reliance of ;```? to make the syntax looks a bit more like python?\r\n\r\nThis is out of the scope of this PR. I think it should go in an RFC.\r\n\r\n> The use %var[index] vs of %var.index seems was not discussed, and perhaps need some discussion\r\n\r\nThis is fair. There should be a new RFC soon for features that have not been implemented in the parser yet, including tuple projection. I was maintaining the convention in the commented out parts of the parser and in the old text printer.\r\n\r\n> The gnf flag of printer should be removed, as the printer should support print GNF, ANF mixed code automatically.\r\n        We want one canonical form of the text format, and we should always print that by default, adding additional flags creates un-necessary metal burdens to the user and can also blow up the interface\r\n\r\nWith the gnf flag enabled (this is done by default in both Python and in C++), the new printer behaves as the old text printer did. The opposite of gnf printing isn't anf, since let nodes are printable with gnf enabled. Rather turning gnf off prevents the creation of temporary variables, which is the style used for anf components of gnf programs. I've received feedback from some developers that this is desirable, and it's useful to bridge the gap between ML and PL.

But it is not a good idea to do so in a user-facing API.\r\n\r\nI was a big fan of a list of thousands of arguments(hey who do not want new features)? However, the problem of having such new features means two things:\r\n- Users have to understand about these new options (e.g. what does gnf stands for?, imagine what will user think when reading the document of astext and find about this additional option).\r\n- They bring burden to maintain these features (technical debts)\r\n- Something can go wrong\r\n\r\nIn particular, in the case of gnf=False, the semantics of the program is no longer equivalent to the original one when there are shared path (such as ResNet). This can be very problematic, because astext is supposed to create a bidirectional format (in the case of gnf=False this is no longer true)\r\n\r\nNote that if the program itself is ANF already, printing with the normal mode should work out of the box, so we also do not need such option as well.\r\n\r\nSo to make things simpler for the public facing API, I think we should simply disable this to remove ambiguity. This is mainly because we have the graph node syntax in the program(unlike typical FP languages). This way, the user has one less concept to learn, and we have one precise syntax for the program.\r\n\r\nIf we really want to support some form of such kind of folding in the long term(which I am not sure if it is really necessary). We need to run analysis to detect the nodes that are only referenced once and optionally use an algorithm to decide how to best fold intermediate nodes into an expression. At the same time, the parser has to be updated to support the folded expression. And if we want to switch such printing option on, the flag could be in some global configuration env(something like relay.set_printer_option), which is only used by advanced developers, so users do not have to worry about the additional option.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/471141519/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/471142014","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2605#issuecomment-471142014","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2605","id":471142014,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MTE0MjAxNA==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-09T03:39:04Z","updated_at":"2019-03-09T03:39:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Back to the choices of the tuple projection and separator.
