I also haven't seen it in vs code. And this thing worked for years for the most IDEs. Yes, we can change things comparing to other IDEs and don't do the exact same, but we should do it not in the wrong way IMHO. The empty editor background should be just for the common stuff for opening the IDE once after new installation, remove the empty editor or in rare other cases.\r\n\r\nA dashboard with more stuff like seeing tutorials, some common actions (similar to the empty editor background), recent projets/project groups, etc. is a better use case for a dashboard/startpage that you can always show on startup or before NetBeans starts a little simple dashboard before opening everything in NetBeans to change your case.
