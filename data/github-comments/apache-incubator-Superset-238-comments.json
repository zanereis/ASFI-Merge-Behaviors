If I were to redo this, I would:\r\n\r\n- First update the docker-compose.yaml files to refer to the new port mapping for both the Postgres image and the environment variable for superset. Note that I made the source and destination port the same (5344:5344)\r\n- Next I'd run the initialization docker-compose command which would build the images, containers, and attempt to set up superset but fail\r\n- Then I'd update `postgresql.conf` (I made this easy by changing the volume references to be on the host system so data could persist) to uncomment the port parameter and update it to 5344\r\n- Then I'd rerun the initialization docker-compose command which would succeed and finish setting up the DB\r\n- Then I'd run `docker-compose up` and if I extracted all of the clean steps correctly out of my messy process I used to get to a running system, you should be good to go","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/509501867/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/509502080","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/7805#issuecomment-509502080","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/7805","id":509502080,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwOTUwMjA4MA==","user":{"login":"villebro","id":33317356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzE3MzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33317356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro","html_url":"https://github.com/villebro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-09T06:05:42Z","updated_at":"2019-07-09T06:05:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I would prefer to not have autocommit enabled by default, but understand that many will prefer to have it enabled.

I think the true fix will lie in the function `_process_array_data`. In there, the code takes the original rows of data we get back. It inserts additional rows to expand the array data. These expanded rows will have the full set of expanded columns while the original rows may not. I think the fix would be to modify the original rows to also include all the expanded columns.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/510222103/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/510268883","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/7844#issuecomment-510268883","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/7844","id":510268883,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMDI2ODg4Mw==","user":{"login":"issue-label-bot[bot]","id":48611044,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDg2MTEwNDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/27079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/issue-label-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-10T23:33:20Z","updated_at":"2019-07-10T23:33:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Issue-Label Bot is automatically applying the label `#bug` to this issue, with a confidence of 0.98.
