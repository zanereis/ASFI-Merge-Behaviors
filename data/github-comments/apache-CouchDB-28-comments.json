At least I don't see the server decoding it, it just saves it as 24.\r\n\r\nOh I wonder if you meant the case where attachments are auto-compressed on the server when stored to disk. In that case it would be just checked based on Content-type so setting that to text/plain would enable it. However that's similar a bit to how compression works for documents, it saves disk space but external size and doc size limits is still calculated based on uploaded (uncompressed) size.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/326674803/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/327021955","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/787#issuecomment-327021955","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/787","id":327021955,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNzAyMTk1NQ==","user":{"login":"wohali","id":112292,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjI5Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112292?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali","html_url":"https://github.com/wohali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-04T20:03:06Z","updated_at":"2017-09-04T20:03:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"You should be able to just upgrade to the 2.1 packages and use `couchup` to migrate your databases. \r\n\r\nThe new packages were designed for upgrade via `apt` or `apt-get`, which will uninstall 1.6 and install 2.1 in a single step.
