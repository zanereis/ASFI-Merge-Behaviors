I don't know if minions do tasks, but something to consider.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/706823255/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/706827806","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/6039#issuecomment-706827806","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/6039","id":706827806,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwNjgyNzgwNg==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-12T02:59:58Z","updated_at":"2020-10-12T02:59:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"added notes about implications of \"add table\" and the current design of ServiceManager.

Can we use the standard SQL syntax of providing the subquery inside parentheses to clearly distinguish between outer and inner queries.\r\n\r\n@siddharthteotia Good question. Currently Pinot does not support nested query or join (both query parser and engine), so we use transform function as a work-around to achieve the same semantic. In the future we might want to provide the native nested query and join support, or provide a translation layer where such queries can be rewritten into the format in this PR. The scope of supporting nested query and join is way larger than this PR, so right now we force users to use the transform function for the id_set subquery.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/707302712/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/707351920","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/6134#issuecomment-707351920","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/6134","id":707351920,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwNzM1MTkyMA==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-12T21:21:37Z","updated_at":"2020-10-13T22:13:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-pinot/pull/6134?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#6134](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-pinot/pull/6134?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-pinot/commit/1beaab59b73f26c4e35f3b9bc856b03806cddf5a?el=desc) will **increase** coverage by `6.47%`.\n> The diff coverage is `59.69%`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-pinot/pull/6134/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&height=150&src=pr&token=4ibza2ugkz)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-pinot/pull/6134?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@            Coverage Diff             @@\n##           master    #6134      +/-   ##\n==========================================\n+ Coverage   66.44%   72.92%   +6.47%     \n==========================================\n  Files        1075     1223     +148     \n  Lines       54773    57744    +2971     \n  Branches     8168     8522     +354     \n==========================================\n+ Hits        36396    42111    +5715     \n+ Misses      15700    12877    -2823     \n- Partials     2677     2756      +79     \n```\n\n| Flag | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| #integration | `45.40% <48.75%> (?)` | |\n| #unittests | `64.04% <38.00%> (?)` | |\n\nFlags with carried forward coverage won't be shown.

It is unclear on why removing tyrus requires changing MeetupStream to be a static file. Could you explain?\r\n\r\nCurrently Tyrus is only used for streaming data in `RealtimeQuickStart` class.  It depends on an external source for now (i.e. meetup.com). If anything breaks in the upstream, our build/test will inevitably fail (this is what we faced recently).\r\nPlus, the current logic doesn't validate the actual result from this event because the result isn't deterministic; it just evaluates whether realtime table has consumed some data. Emitting some sample events from a sample file should suffice this requirement. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/708083475/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/708091444","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/6139#issuecomment-708091444","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/6139","id":708091444,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwODA5MTQ0NA==","user":{"login":"jackjlli","id":35080149,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MDgwMTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35080149?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli","html_url":"https://github.com/jackjlli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-14T01:02:24Z","updated_at":"2020-10-14T01:02:24Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> can you please make sure quickstart (both offline and realtime) works\r\n\r\nI've tested it in both pinot-tools and pinot-distributions modules and all quick start tests work.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/708091444/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/708113812","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/6044#issuecomment-708113812","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/6044","id":708113812,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwODExMzgxMg==","user":{"login":"mayankshriv","id":12615885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjE1ODg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12615885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv","html_url":"https://github.com/mayankshriv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-14T02:22:07Z","updated_at":"2020-10-14T02:22:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I still feel using fixed thread pool for single-threaded case can add overhead to the reducer, but if the perf shows no difference, I'm okay with it.\r\n\r\nI agree that it will add overhead.

this seems exactly like transform functions, there's some differences because of which we cannot handle this solely as regular transform functions.\r\n\r\nSay we have columns `a, b, c` in the raw data source.\r\nSay we have columns `a, c, x, y` in the Pinot schema, such that\r\n```\r\na -> a\r\nc -> c\r\nx -> f (b)\r\ny -> f(a, c)\r\n\r\n```\r\n1) The way transform functions are designed right now, arguments to transform functions can only be from `a, b, c`.  If we wanted to add `z -> f(x, y)`, this would not be supported.\r\n2) Transform functions are only evaluated during ingestion. In case of derived columns, we want to support adding even after segment creation i.e. add some derived columns to an existing schema, and see the new values in the segments after a reload.\r\n\r\n**Changes**\r\n1 is easy to fix, and can be done by simply enhancing the support for transform configs. Some changes needed:\r\n- Remove validations which prevent adding transform functions of the derived kind (i.e. y = f(z) and x = f(y) is blocked in Table config validations right now, can be easily removed).\r\n- In the ExpressionTransformer, we simply identify the derived columns, and evaluate them after the non-derived fields.\r\n\r\nHandling 2 will need some more changes. We need to start computing the derived field's transform functions, during segment reload. For this, we could piggyback on the `DefaultColumnHandler`. Similar to `BaseDefaultColumnHandler#updateDefaultColumn`, we can introduce a `BaseDefaultColumnHandler#updateDerivedColumns`, which can be called instead of `updateDefaultColumn` if the column is a derived field.\r\n\r\n**Identifying derived fields**\r\nWe also need a flag on the FieldSpec called `derived`. This flag will help us distinguish between derived fields and regular fields. Here's an example for why we need this:\r\nYou may have `y = f(z) and x = f(y)`. Here x is obviously derived, as it is using `y` as arguments, and `y` is not in source data.\r\nYou may also have `y = y and x = f(y)`. Here it is not obvious that x is a derived field or not, because y is both source and destination. \r\nIn both of the examples, `x` will be evaluated during segment creation. The deciding factor for whether a field is derived or not, is whether user wants Pinot to generate the values during a segment reload, if the column was not already present.\r\nIf user marks `x` as a derived column and reloads segments, all segments missing `x` should evaluate `x = f(y)` using value of `y` already in the segment.\r\nIf user does not mark `x` as a derived column, during reload, all segments missing `x` should simply add default value for `x`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/708706434/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/708710753","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/5509#issuecomment-708710753","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/5509","id":708710753,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwODcxMDc1Mw==","user":{"login":"npawar","id":19693933,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjkzOTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19693933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar","html_url":"https://github.com/npawar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-14T23:19:35Z","updated_at":"2020-10-14T23:19:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"FYI

The purpose of the quick start is letting the user play with Pinot and they should be able to see the latest events from a real stream instead of the unchanged records. Is there a way to solve this issue without hardcode the data file?\r\n> Also, I'm not able to reproduce this issue locally. Did I miss something?\r\n\r\n@Jackie-Jiang The tyrus dependency causes a lot of issues for me as well, e.g. when running perfBenchmarkRunner locally.\r\nI agree we should have recipe/setup/demo using live stream. However, note that quickStart is also being used as a test, which makes it brittle if upstream has an issue (we had this recently).\r\n\r\nMy recommendation is to have the test part of quick-start read data from a deterministic source (e.g. local stream or static file). However, in this case, quick-start (as a user demo tool) remains untested. For this, we could have a quick-start test based on real stream only when cutting the release (instead of all commits).
