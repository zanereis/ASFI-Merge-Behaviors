Also, the Metron archetype wouldn't show up. I would run it in the full dev CentOS vm and get 3.0.1 every time. I thought it might be some MacPorts or ZShell weirdness, so I tried with Bash and still the same. Then I downloaded a fresh version of Maven and ran the binary directly - again, same result. Next, I ran the same command while adding the \"-U\" option for updating snapshots. Per the name, you'd think this would only affect snapshots, however here are the results.\r\n```\r\nmvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeCatalog=local                                                                                                            <<<\r\n[INFO] Scanning for projects...\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Building Maven Stub Project (No POM) 1\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] >>> maven-archetype-plugin:3.0.1:generate (default-cli) > generate-sources @ standalone-pom >>>\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] <<< maven-archetype-plugin:3.0.1:generate (default-cli) < generate-sources @ standalone-pom <<<\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] --- maven-archetype-plugin:3.0.1:generate (default-cli) @ standalone-pom ---\r\n[INFO] Generating project in Interactive mode\r\n[INFO] No archetype defined.

I didn't pour over each file, but I did at least scan every single change and it looks good. Clicking the \"load diff\" option repeatedly was very much like an episode of the Twilight Zone. :)\r\n\r\nIn the process of getting IntelliJ's code formatting to work properly, I actually went through some of this already and am thankful for the effort here! I had to disable Javadoc formatting because it was determined to format everything, including the license headers. There simply is no way to keep javadoc formatting without munging the license headers in IntelliJ AFAICT. I had experimented with a similar change and found this change from javadoc to code comment format to work well. First concern I had was whether there was any requirement around the header being a javadoc vs non-javadoc style comment. I wasn't able to find any such requirement per http://www.apache.org/legal/src-headers.html. I believe the text lines and spacing are the only things that will trip up the Rat plugin.\r\n\r\nAnother nice side effect of this work is that I think I can setup a proper license header template in IntelliJ again without worrying about the unwanted javadoc formatting.

Thanks @ottobackwards. \r\n\r\nI want to repeat my appreciation for this contribution. I know it's taking us time to get through review, and there's a lot of work in merging ongoing changes, so thank you for being so patient and responsive!\r\n\r\nI have some comments around the documentation as it stands. I love the detail. This is probably more broadly and fully documented than many other pieces of Metron. The only issue I see right now is that in order to know which pages/READMEs are needed to add functionality requires the contributor to skim through the full doc TOC.\r\n\r\nI think it's still challenging to get a quick comprehension of the extension/bundle/assembly/parser architecture with this README doc layout. The subject separation is both useful and overwhelming at the same time. I want users and contributors alike to get a quick sense of how to add general purpose functionality, concrete OOTB core functionality, as well as their own custom functionality. In order to even understand or know that these levels of abstraction exist and then act on them, I found it necessary to read through the entire doc structure to get a sense of things. For example, this is the minimal set of docs a developer would need to read for managing parsers/bundles/extensions, and I collected this list by clicking through every link in the TOC. \r\n- bundles-lib\r\n- bundles-maven-plugin\r\n- maven-archetypes\r\n    - maven-parser-extension-archeytpe\r\n- extensions\r\n    - deployment\r\n    - packaging\r\n    - terms\r\n    - parser-extensions\r\n        - adding system parsers\r\n        - etc.\r\n- parsers\r\n    - parser-testing\r\n\r\nI think we should have an overarching document that ties all of these components together cohesively from the perspective of extending Metron. The mindset I'm taking here is very use case driven. I'm thinking something like a document in the top-level of the project that covers \"Extending Metron\" and then provides very clear overview and path for a soup-to-nuts new parser stream.

I'll do my best to answer them, but the answer to some of these expands past this PR and to the history of Taxii support for Metron (which was one of the first things we added and thus at a period of time where documentation was scarcer than it is even now ;) )\r\n\r\n* `Where is the documentation for the version of Stix and the Version of Cybox metron supports?`\r\nWe do not currently document that, the answer is, however, that our support for Stix, cybox and taxii is entirely bound up in the mitre java-stix library.  We use the most current version [released](https://github.com/STIXProject/java-stix/tree/v1.2.0.2), which is 1.2.0.2.\r\n\r\n* `How is the extractor factored to handle support for other versions?`\r\nThe extractor is handled to support other versions only insomuch as the java-stix library can support multiple versions.  As this is officially supported by the stix project, I think that it's backwards compatible, but there may be nuance here that I'm missing.\r\n\r\n* `How is the extractor factored to handle JSON if / when stix and cybox change over?`\r\nThe extractor abstraction works at the level of the object model that the java-stix library provides us rather than doing actual parsing (i.e. we implement support for new types by providing a handler that looks for objects of that type as the output of the parse).  If Stix moves to JSON, presumably the library will handle that transparently *or* we'll need another approach.\r\n\r\n* `Can we handle just Cybox? Should this be factored to support them separately?`\r\nWe can create handlers for anything the java-stix library can parse, but cybox seems to be common and officially supported by the stix project.\r\n\r\n* `Where is the documentation for the support in this PR?`\r\nI added the new URI type to the README.md in metron-data-management.  Since that's the scope of this PR, not to document better our taxii/stix/etc support.\r\n\r\nOk, so it's apparent that some of the design decisions around taxii never made it into documentation.  A couple of questions for you:\r\n* Where should that documentation live?\r\n* Are we unhappy enough about having our abstraction bound to the (from what I can tell only) java library provided by the stix project that you'd like to start a discuss thread about developing a better approach to taxii?\r\n\r\nJust a note on the second, we chose that because it was the only game in town other than parsing the XML ourselves and it was the officially supported library.  I even looked into that and decided against it as the XML format is extremely complex with lots of referential links that need to get coalesced to handle the blocks of stix that come across.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/321588498/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/321599099","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/689#issuecomment-321599099","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/689","id":321599099,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMTU5OTA5OQ==","user":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-10T16:12:39Z","updated_at":"2017-08-10T16:12:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Can we handle just Cybox\r\n\r\nWhat I mean is, can we import a file that is **ONLY** cybox observables, without Stix.\r\n\r\nStix supports cybox.
