Thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.The package of sharding-core-common should be basic package which is used by other packages, so it is better to move all the classes related to LeafSegmentKeyGenerator to sharding-orchestration-core.\r\n\r\n2.When LeafSegmentKeyGenerator is in sharding-orchestration-core, maybe we can consider to use CuratorZookeeperRegistryCenter instead of LeafCuratorZookeeper. The function of incrementCacheId in LeafCuratorZookeeper can considered to move to LeafSegmentKeyGenerator, and moving tryLock() to CuratorZookeeperRegistryCenter is ok?\r\n\r\n3.The API of generateKey() now is to return null in LeafSegmentKeyGenerator, but it is not allowed to modify APIs. Therefore using generateKey(), not generateKey(tableName) is a better choice.\r\n\r\n4.Actually, LeafSegmentKeyGenerator really needs tableName as a key in zk. So i suggest set tableName in properties of LeafSegmentKeyGenerator and getTableName() from properties to use it in zk.\r\n\r\n5.The another important thing is multiple schemas. If user use same tableName in multiple schemas, the node value of same table name in zk will be overwrite. So please consider use schemaName and tableName as note key.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/496760228/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/496774074","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/pull/2462#issuecomment-496774074","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/2462","id":496774074,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5Njc3NDA3NA==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-29T03:56:04Z","updated_at":"2019-05-29T03:56:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## Pull Request Test Coverage Report for [Build 8265](https://coveralls.io/builds/23662619)\n\n* **0** of **0**   changed or added relevant lines in **0** files are covered.\n* No unchanged relevant lines lost coverage.\n* Overall coverage remained the same at **60.439%**\n\n---\n\n\n\n|  Totals | [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/builds/23662619/badge)](https://coveralls.io/builds/23662619) |\n| :-- | --: |\n| Change from base [Build 8264](https://coveralls.io/builds/23652565): |  0.0% |\n| Covered Lines: | 8172 |\n| Relevant Lines: | 13521 |\n\n---\n##### 💛  -

Maybe we can have a discussion on two of optimization terms.\r\n1. The configurations of regsitry, in which we can find required items and optional items. For required items, we need to check them when initializing LeafGenerator e.g, serverLists, TYPE, namespace.\r\n2. Can LeafGenerator use other registry center e.g, ETCD?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/498666023/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/498898595","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/pull/2493#issuecomment-498898595","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/2493","id":498898595,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5ODg5ODU5NQ==","user":{"login":"wgy8283335","id":22066046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDY2MDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22066046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgy8283335","html_url":"https://github.com/wgy8283335","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgy8283335/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgy8283335/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgy8283335/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgy8283335/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgy8283335/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgy8283335/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgy8283335/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgy8283335/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgy8283335/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-05T01:03:46Z","updated_at":"2019-06-05T01:03:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tristaZero.
