yes, your big rec will raise the Segmentation fault error. i found the error log is : `Exception AttributeError: \"'NoneType' object has no attribute 'path'\" in <function _remove at 0x7fe3c52cc488> ignored`, so it may be caused by your big rec file which was generated wrong, because your small rec file is correct.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/253685006/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/253691523","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/3521#issuecomment-253691523","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/3521","id":253691523,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MzY5MTUyMw==","user":{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-14T02:07:01Z","updated_at":"2016-10-14T02:07:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@Ldpe2G

for the test. \nTo make it sure, I checked my .lst file to make sure no image and label is incorrect, then remade .rec file using mxnet/bin/im2rec. Then I tested the file and now its behavior seems somewhat undefined; segfaults sometimes happen, sometimes not. \nAlso, I wrapped the test code into a function and called the function instead of directly executing the test code. Segfault did not happen in this setting, where I have no idea why. \nIt seems that no one else is having this problem, and I think this issue can be closed for now.

Move them here.\n- Deep Learning Design Notes\n  This section will be updated with self-contained design notes on various aspect of deep learning systems, in terms of abstraction, optimization and trade-off.\n- Programming Models for Deep Learning\n- Dependency Engine for Deep Learning\n- Squeeze the Memory Consumption of Deep Learning\n- Efficient Data Loading Module for Deep Learning\n- Survey of RNN Interface\n\n**Architecture**\nHave MXNet system specific details here.\nAlso, have sections on code walk through etc. Objective is to enable readers to understand system followed by architecture of mxnet and then link them to appropriate code sections.\n\n**Community**\n- Link to how to contribute\n- Link to committers guide : details for committers on merge, regression test etc.\n- Link to email-list\n- Link to issues folder\n- Link to \"Roadmap\" section. We can capture next big things to be done in mxnet. We can even write a one liner in docs and link back to issue in issues folder.\n\nI will create separate issues to track these tasks. Do let me know what you guys think about the proposal.\n\nWe can iteratively fix section by section.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/253803779/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/253804129","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/3504#issuecomment-253804129","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/3504","id":253804129,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MzgwNDEyOQ==","user":{"login":"sandeep-krishnamurthy","id":3403674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDM2NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3403674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy","html_url":"https://github.com/sandeep-krishnamurthy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-14T13:50:25Z","updated_at":"2016-10-14T13:50:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Submitted PR for\n- High level headers\n- Fork me on github ribbon\n- Rename Package to API\n\nhttps://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/pull/3526\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/253804129/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/253805974","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/3504#issuecomment-253805974","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/3504","id":253805974,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MzgwNTk3NA==","user":{"login":"sandeep-krishnamurthy","id":3403674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDM2NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3403674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy","html_url":"https://github.com/sandeep-krishnamurthy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-14T13:55:54Z","updated_at":"2016-10-14T13:55:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"We should also have a **Glossary** section.

x64系统python跑的，测试了20160531_win2012_x64_gpu、20160419_win2012_x64_gpu、20160321_win2012_x64_gpu（该版本少了transpose symbol）共3个版本，下载自：https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/releases 已经编译好的包包，使用GPU均完整跑完上面说的案例，以及使用CPU跑完xlvector的ocr案例，最终结果精度都是0（有时会是0.000110）\n\n之所以怀疑是否windows版本的mxnet有bug，是因为我看博客上其他人也遇到类似的问题（连接找不到了），正准备去在ubuntu上测试看的，因为他们说成功的好像都是在linux下。\n\n我还测试调大了数据量，比如从10万调整到了100万，学习率从0.001到0.01，以及batch_size从8调整到260等等，测试无数次没有一次成的，基本都是突然到0.003，然后慢慢掉回到0，我确认过期间产生的图片是正常的，一切看似都正常。同时我测试mxnet里面的案例比如nmist的结果也是正常，到底是什么缘故呢，谢谢！\n\n以下是我刚刚跑的输出，代码一个没动，即使我无论怎么修改参数，结果也都类似：\nQ:\\Anaconda2\\python.exe
