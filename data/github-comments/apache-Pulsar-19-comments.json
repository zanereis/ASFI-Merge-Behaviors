Now, only way to figure out client type(java/cpp) is to check `clientVersion` which was only introduced in [1.18](https://github.com/apache/incubator-pulsar/pull/387) so, there is no deterministic way to find out client type/version when broker create a consumer because this information is not present in ServerCnx.\r\n\r\nNow, I was thinking if is there any way we can determine it based on `subscription-name` and `partitioned-topic index` pattern. eg. Do a validation on pattern subscription-name `subX` and topic-name `-partitions-X`. If `X` matches then we can do validation. However, it also does not provide deterministic way to find out if request comes from old-client if sub-name ends with digit. For example:\r\neg:\r\nCheck: `subX`, `partitions-X` matches?\r\n- sub-name: sub : \r\nOld client: `sub1, topic-partitions-1 -> Pattern matches` Reject if topic is partitioned?: Reject\r\nnew client: `sub, topic-partitions-1 -> Pattern doesn't match`. Pass\r\n- sub-name: sub1: \r\nOld client: `sub11, topic-partitions-1 -> Pattern matches ` Reject if topic is partitioned?: Reject\r\nnew client: `sub1, topic-partitions-1 -> Pattern matches` Reject if topic is partitioned? Reject-[x]\r\n- sub-name: sub11: \r\nOld client: `sub1111, topic-partitions-11 -> Pattern matches` Reject if topic is partitioned?
