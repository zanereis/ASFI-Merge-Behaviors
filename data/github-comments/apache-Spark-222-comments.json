One comment I have though is that we should add more test coverage, to make sure we cover all the data types supported. Instead of doing this in doc comments, which gets unwieldy, you can do it in python/pyspark/tests.py, which is a standalone test file. Just make sure we have tests that cover each supported data type in sequence files.\n\n@MLnick you should look at this too when you have a chance.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/48818519/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/48818627","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1372#issuecomment-48818627","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1372","id":48818627,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4ODE4NjI3","user":{"login":"mateiz","id":228859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODg1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz","html_url":"https://github.com/mateiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-12T17:32:00Z","updated_at":"2014-07-12T17:32:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yeah I agree they might need to be debug. @tdas what do you think?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/48818627/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/48818646","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1387#issuecomment-48818646","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1387","id":48818646,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4ODE4NjQ2","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-12T17:32:34Z","updated_at":"2014-07-12T17:32:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA tests have started for PR 1387.

Agree with Matei that I think the tests should live in `tests.py` as opposed to docstrings, and add tests for other datatypes in a similar manner to the input format tests\n2. Would be great to add a couple of examples of using the custom `Converter` in reverse for output. Again, a Cassandra and HBase example in similar vein to the input format examples would be valuable I think\n\nWill provide any more feedback as I go through it in more detail.\n\n(btw thanks for

too).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/48820160/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/48820672","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1371#issuecomment-48820672","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1371","id":48820672,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4ODIwNjcy","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-12T18:51:01Z","updated_at":"2014-07-12T18:51:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA

can look into how they implement it. \n\nNow I think about it a little bit more, I actually agree with @yhuai that we should handle the newlines in an input format. As for the function that accepts an RDD, it is best to just treat each line as one record instead of collapsing multiple lines due to line breaks. That's what's expected from other APIs (e.g. JSON).\n\nWe gotta be careful with this parsing thing - we don't want a simple malformed file to cause Spark to run out of memory, which is what will happen right now with a single unclosing

Ideally, defaults work for lots of cases. A flat value is the simplest of models, and anecdotally, the current default value does not work in medium- to large-memory YARN jobs. You can increase the default, but then the overhead gets silly for small jobs -- 1GB? And all of these are not-uncommon use cases.\n\nNone of that implies the overhead logically scales with container memory. Empirically, it may do, and that's useful. Until the magic explanatory variable is found, which one is less problematic for end users -- a flat constant that frequently has to be tuned, or an imperfect model that could get it right in more cases? \n\nThat said it is kind of a developer API change and feels like something to not keep reimagining.\n\nNiskham can you share any anecdotal evidence about how the overhead changes.
