I won't notify you again about this release, but will get in touch when a new version is available. If you'd rather skip all updates until the next major or minor version, let me know by commenting `@dependabot ignore this major version` or `@dependabot ignore this minor version`. You can also ignore all major, minor, or patch releases for a dependency by adding an [`ignore` condition](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates#ignore) with the desired `update_types` to your config file.\n\nIf you change your mind, just re-open this PR and I'll resolve any conflicts on it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/comments/2583302069/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":{"id":29110,"client_id":"Iv1.4f9a6346434f815e","slug":"dependabot","node_id":"MDM6QXBwMjkxMTA=","owner":{"login":"github","id":9919,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjk5MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github","html_url":"https://github.com/github","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"name":"Dependabot","description":"","external_url":"https://dependabot-api.githubapp.com","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/dependabot","created_at":"2019-04-16T22:34:25Z","updated_at":"2024-03-20T21:06:35Z","permissions":{"actions":"read","checks":"write","contents":"write","issues":"write","members":"read","metadata":"read","pull_requests":"write","statuses":"read","vulnerability_alerts":"read","workflows":"write"},"events":["check_suite","issues","issue_comment","label","pull_request","pull_request_review","pull_request_review_comment","repository"]}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/comments/2585511502","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues/1950#issuecomment-2585511502","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/1950","id":2585511502,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAARy8s6aG8ZO","user":{"login":"phdbutbachelor","id":45504533,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NTA0NTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45504533?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phdbutbachelor","html_url":"https://github.com/phdbutbachelor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phdbutbachelor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phdbutbachelor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phdbutbachelor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phdbutbachelor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phdbutbachelor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phdbutbachelor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phdbutbachelor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phdbutbachelor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phdbutbachelor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-12T01:02:30Z","updated_at":"2025-01-12T01:02:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> Also, is this issue SSE-specific, or are is every request failing like this?
