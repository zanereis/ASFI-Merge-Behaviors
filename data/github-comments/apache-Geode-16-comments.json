@PurelyApplied,\r\n\r\nThanks for notifying me about these problems, I'll keep them in mind for future changes!.\r\nJust one comment from my side..\r\n\r\n> Inner classes should not be interspersed with methods. Put them either at the beginning or the end of the class, whichever is more appropriate for readability.\r\n\r\nMy preferred style is to put them wherever they seem to make most sense, and for this particular case I've just added them before the single group of methods that actually uses the inner class. That said, there are several inner classes interspersed with methods through the source code (not only within test classes), so I'm guessing this is just a preference instead of a standardized source code style, is that right?. If it is, shouldn't we _enforce_ this rule through the **com.diffplug.gradle.spotless** to avoid this kind of code being merged and fail fast?. Or even add the specific guideline to the [Code Style Guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/GEODE/Code+Style+Guide)?.\r\nJust my two cents.\r\nCheers!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/364379021/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/364445561","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/1400#issuecomment-364445561","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/1400","id":364445561,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDQ0NTU2MQ==","user":{"login":"metatype","id":2790361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3OTAzNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2790361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype","html_url":"https://github.com/metatype","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-09T14:17:48Z","updated_at":"2018-02-09T14:17:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"clean

\r\nYeah, I should've used less absolute language about the stylistic things.  As you linked, neither our adoption of Google's Java Style nor our minor differences with it mention anything about inner classes.\r\n\r\nFor my philosophically two cents, I think that if a class is meant to be a level of abstraction, it should be abstracted *away* and not be in the guts of implementation details.  Putting it at the bottom makes sense to me in the same way that `public` methods belong at the top of a class.  But yes, it's more a personal preference and style than any standardization.\r\n\r\nThen again, I'd love to have a longer conversation about adopting and adhering to a stricter code style (and correcting those numerous cases where the codebase currently falls short).

I had had it in `o.a.g.m.i.c.commands`, only because that's where `GfshCommand` lives, but backed it up one since it's not really `command` material.\r\n* I have mixed feelings about anonymous classes.
