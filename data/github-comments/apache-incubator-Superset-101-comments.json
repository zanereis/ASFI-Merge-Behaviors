(You need to [create a new table, copy everything over, drop the old table, then rename the new table to the old name](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1884787/how-do-i-drop-a-constraint-from-a-sqlite-3-6-21-table).) So you are left with the old constraint, and never add the new improved one.\r\n\r\nThis code also shows why the problem doesn't happen in Postgres: there the migration succeeds, so the old too-restrictive constraint is dropped.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/337415008/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/337436442","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/3668#issuecomment-337436442","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/3668","id":337436442,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzQzNjQ0Mg==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-18T01:47:46Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T01:47:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\n[![Coverage

@graceguo-supercat Unfortunately I can't get SuperSet to build locally right now so I can't test, but...\r\n\r\nThe dialog presented to the user gives them the option to save / overwrite slices as well as save / overwrite dashboards.\r\n\r\nSo, the above check that gives the user an error when saving / overwriting the slice will need to be two-fold:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nif action == 'overwrite' and not slice_overwrite_perm:\r\n  return json_error_response(\"You don't have the rights to alter this slice\", status=400)\r\n\r\nif action == 'saveas' and not slice_add_perm:\r\n  return json_error_response(\"You don't have the rights to create a slice\", status=400)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the user has those permissions, a dashboard permission check would be needed before the section saving / creating dashboards:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndash = ... # find dashboard from request\r\ncheck_ownership(dash, raise_if_false=True)\r\n... # update dashboard\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndash_add_perm = self.can_access('can_add', 'DashboardModelView')\r\nif request.args.get('add_to_dash') == 'new' and not dash_add_perm:\r\n  return json_error_response(\"You don't have the rights to create a dashboard\", status=400)\r\n\r\n# ... save dashboard\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat is mostly psuedo-code since I can't actually test it right now and I'm not sure the best design for error handling here.\r\n\r\nAlso, from a UX viewpoint, it would be nice to have the \"Save\" button in the explore view be disabled if the user doesn't have the ability to save / alter slices, but I have no idea what those changes would look like.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/337450495/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/337489225","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/3451#issuecomment-337489225","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/3451","id":337489225,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzQ4OTIyNQ==","user":{"login":"beenhead","id":7432496,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MzI0OTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7432496?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beenhead","html_url":"https://github.com/beenhead","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beenhead/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beenhead/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beenhead/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beenhead/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beenhead/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beenhead/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beenhead/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beenhead/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beenhead/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-18T07:47:35Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T07:47:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"As
