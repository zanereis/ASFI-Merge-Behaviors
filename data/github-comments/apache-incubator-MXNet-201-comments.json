The port is in the early stages of development as you note.  Glad to see this issue since we wanted to make sure the community was aware of our plans and get some early feedback before we get too deep into the port.  Let me provide a little background on the tools and what we'd like to do, and ask a couple questions:\r\n\r\n[HIP](https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/HIP) is an open-source toolkit designed to port CUDA code.  After porting, the code can run on AMD [ROCm](https://rocm.github.io) GPU platform or still on the original CUDA (with same performance).   HIP runtime and C++ language are familiar to CUDA programmers so the porting process is lightweight and does little damage to the original code.   The HIP code is easy to maintain since it is close to CUDA, and provides full C++ support including templates, classes, namespaces, etc.   HIP runtime code, headers, and porting tools are maintained on GitHub  and updated every 2-4 weeks by AMD developers.\r\n\r\nAMD is also developing an open-source optimized machine intelligence library called \"MIOpen\".  This will contain convolution, pooling, and other kernels which have been optimized for AMD GPUs.  The MIOpen host runtime API accepts HIP parameters for things like streams, and also defines Tensor and other structures for memory management.   MIOpen is currently internal but will be open-sourced shortly.\r\n\r\nWe'd like to use these tools to enable MXNet to run on the ROCm platform.  Overall strategy would be to port the CUDA code to HIP, and add the calls into MIOpen in the appropriate layers so it runs fast.   The MXNet port is being developed in the open [here](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/mxnet).  \r\n\r\nOne early design question we could use some help on: the port currently replaces the CUDA code with HIP code.  This was an easy way to start since it requires less initial modification to the MXNet make system - we can just port the .cu files and start building.  However, we likely want to instead use a design where the HIP files exist alongside the CUDA ones.  What is best way to add a new HIP target to the MXNet code - where should we put the files, and what make changes are required?  \r\n\r\nThanks!  We look forward to participating in the MXNet community,\r\n-ben\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/305976539/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/305987202","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/6527#issuecomment-305987202","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/6527","id":305987202,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNTk4NzIwMg==","user":{"login":"Glorainow","id":10113610,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTEzNjEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10113610?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Glorainow","html_url":"https://github.com/Glorainow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Glorainow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Glorainow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Glorainow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Glorainow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Glorainow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Glorainow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Glorainow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Glorainow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Glorainow/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-03T16:52:29Z","updated_at":"2017-06-04T04:01:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@eldercrow need_top_grad has been set to False.\r\n\r\nI checked the backward **Node**s generated, it seems that the problem arises because of an out-of-date understand about how loss layers work.

Do you have a way to make this copy-paste runnable?\r\n\r\n>> we need to update the doc for everything release\r\n\r\nDo you mean the example in this line needs to be changed for every release?\r\n```\r\n$ git checkout tags/<name-of-the-release-tag> #Example: git checkout tags/v0.10.0\r\n```\r\nI agree keeping it updated with the latest version number is good. Note that this is only an example. While it is good to keep that updated with the latest version, it won't break anything if we miss.

resnet_fp16.py *_fp16_* kernels are called, i.e. maxwell_fp16_scudnn_fp16_128x128_small_nn vs. maxwell_scudnn_128x128_small_nn in case of resnet.py, which is a good sign. However, maxwell_fp16_scudnn_fp16_128x128_small_nn kernel takes 63.5 s in total for all 1000 runs, whereas maxwell_scudnn_128x128_small_nn takes 44.3 s in total.\r\n\r\nincreasing batch size to 2 results into 28.6 s for maxwell_fp16_scudnn_fp16_128x128_small_nn vs. 39.9 s for maxwell_scudnn_128x128_small_nn, which is encouraging. However, the second most time consuming kernel maxwell_fp16_scudnn_winograd_fp16_128x128_mobile_tile148t_nt takes 21.7 s vs. 14.7 s in case of maxwell_scudnn_winograd_128x128_mobile_tile148t_nt.

This makes my build unusable for our purposes. Another was that I had to change g++ to g++-7, gcc to gcc-7, and linker flags in `scala-package/native/osx-x86_64-cpu/pom.xml` and `scala-package/init-native/osx-x86_64/pom.xml` from `-force_load` to `-Wl,-force_load,` in three places.\r\n\r\nThe result is a full mxnet/scala package with 0.10.1-SNAPSHOT version that I can now use to load the json file and param file for our trained model that uses CTC Loss. So, indeed if you could just build and publish the latest 0.10 release for scala package with supported platforms (OSX and Linux64), that would fully solve my problem.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the problem would be fully solved and we would be unblocked if you could just compile the jni library `libmxnet-scala-osx-x86_64-cpu.jnilib` for the 0.10 release on OSX non-gpu. That's the only thing I can't compile correctly so far. (Linux compilation works fine!)
