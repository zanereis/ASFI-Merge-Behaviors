The canonicalzation is applied at comparison time, in the engine, so storage is not required to canonicalize. Of course, it would be better to have writers canonicalize, but I am concerned we will be never able to assume that at read time, because of pre-existing data.\r\n\r\nHowever, even if we follow this path, we still could want to define how NaNs interact with `distinct_counts` in manifest.\r\nOr, we would ignore `distinct_counts` whenever `nan_value_counts > 0`.\r\n(I don't know yet, whether this is important.

Most of the early incremental consumption focuses on the easy case, appends, for that reason. But there are ways to make it work. For example, you could read all the deleted files and all the added files in an overwrite and use a full outer join to label each row deleted, added, or kept and then feed those rows into incremental processing. That join is expensive, though.\r\n\r\nAnother strategy is to read just the added files and consider all of the changes sort of an `upsert` operation. As long as you know that all of the data coming in replaces 0 or 1 rows, then you may not need to know what the previous row was. The problem is that this makes assumptions about the operation that happened and doesn't apply to all cases. For your deduplication case, it wouldn't tell you when duplicate rows are removed.\r\n\r\nI think the easier solution is turning a row-delta commit into changes because you can read the deleted rows and added rows directly without needing to process (and usually discard) the kept rows.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/890152309/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/890277167","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2863#issuecomment-890277167","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2863","id":890277167,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX841EI0v","user":{"login":"Reo-LEI","id":17312872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzEyODcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17312872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reo-LEI","html_url":"https://github.com/Reo-LEI","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reo-LEI/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reo-LEI/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reo-LEI/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reo-LEI/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reo-LEI/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reo-LEI/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reo-LEI/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reo-LEI/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reo-LEI/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-31T02:12:30Z","updated_at":"2021-07-31T02:12:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"ping

Because CDC data shoule be distributed to primary key but not partition fields. For example, an iceberg table has equalityFields (dt, hour, id) and partition fields (dt, hour). If set `write.distribution-mode = hash`, the CDC data will be keyBy (dt, hour), and we can not ensure same id CDC data will send to same `IcebergStreamWriter`. \r\n\r\nAnd the second reason is , for FlinkSQL, `rowDataInput` contain a `FlinkCDCSource ` opr and a `Filter` opr. The `FlinkCDCSource ` opr parallelism is 1 and the `Filter` opr parallelism use job default parallelism. If we only keyBy `rowDataInput` output data to `IcebergStreamWriter`, we will get a job graph as follow: \r\n```\r\n                              +---> Filter ---+      +---> IcebergStreamWriter ---+\r\nFlinkCDCSource ---rebalance---+---> Filter ---+-hash-+---> IcebergStreamWriter ---+---rebalance---> IcebergFilesCommitter\r\n                              +---> Filter ---+      +---> IcebergStreamWriter ---+\r\n```\r\nAs result, the CDC data will be rebalance to `Filter`. That will make CDC data disorder(e.g. same `IcebergStreamWriter` will receive +U before -U), and we will get some strange result. So we need to keep the `Filter` have same parallelism to it's input opr.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/890355891/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/890389829","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/2902#issuecomment-890389829","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2902","id":890389829,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX841EkVF","user":{"login":"GrigorievNick","id":16338643,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzM4NjQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16338643?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrigorievNick","html_url":"https://github.com/GrigorievNick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrigorievNick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrigorievNick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrigorievNick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrigorievNick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrigorievNick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrigorievNick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrigorievNick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrigorievNick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrigorievNick/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-31T18:52:44Z","updated_at":"2021-07-31T18:52:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"May be this is same issue https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/2374?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/890389829/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/890517576","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2898#issuecomment-890517576","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2898","id":890517576,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX841FDhI","user":{"login":"Reo-LEI","id":17312872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzEyODcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17312872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reo-LEI","html_url":"https://github.com/Reo-LEI","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reo-LEI/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reo-LEI/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reo-LEI/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reo-LEI/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reo-LEI/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reo-LEI/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reo-LEI/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reo-LEI/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reo-LEI/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-01T13:07:52Z","updated_at":"2021-08-01T13:07:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Could you take look of this? @openinx ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/890517576/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/890557948","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2867#issuecomment-890557948","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2867","id":890557948,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX841FNX8","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-01T17:23:28Z","updated_at":"2021-08-01T17:23:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@hameizi, could you update the PR description with details about this feature?

That was caused by some unexpected behaviors across a few helpers:\r\n1. `TypeUtil.select` (that uses `PruneColumns`) has behavior like SQL projection using IDs. Any field that is selected by ID is completely projected. For example, selecting `{4}` from the schema `3: id bigint, 4: location struct<5: lat double, 6: long double>` is like `SELECT location` and produces `4: location struct<5: lat double, 6 long double>` as the projected schema. As a result, empty structs can't be selected by this method (or in SQL).\r\n2. `TypeUtil.getProjectedIds` (that uses `GetProjectedIds`) is written expecting the current behavior from `TypeUtil.select`. When finding the IDs needed to describe a projection, it will return all leaf field IDs. Because empty structs contain no leaf fields, there are no IDs returned for an empty struct. Reusing the example above, if the requested projection were `4: location struct<>` (no fields) then the result is `{}` rather than `{4}` because `select` would return all fields of `location`.\r\n3. Record types are position based and readers assume that the expected schema will match the read schema, even though the read schema is produced using the file schema, conversions, and calls to the two methods above. An empty struct in the requested schema will be silently removed, producing a mismatch in the field positions. When reading with `id bigint, location struct<>, data string`, the data produced will be `id bigint, data string`, resulting in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBounds` exception or a `ClassCastException` depending on the rest of the projection.\r\n4. There is a bug that sometimes avoids this problem by accidentally projecting empty structs, but this is not reliable because sometimes the empty struct should not be produced or else it introduces the opposite problem: projecting `id bigint, data string` actually produces `id bigint, location struct<>, data string`.\r\n\r\nHopefully that captures the issues here.\r\n\r\nFirst, I think that `select` behavior is correct. This matches the behavior where a list of selected fields should be turned into a list of IDs and completely projected. Selecting a struct should select all of its fields, as expected by `SELECT location`. The problem is that this is that we assume that the output of `getProjectedIds` will be used for `select` and so it can't return any non-leaf field IDs.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, I propose the following:\r\n* Update the behavior of `getProjectedIds` to return an ID for empty structs. The ID should indicate that the struct must be returned without any fields, unless there are sub-fields selected by a nested field ID.\r\n* Add a `TypeUtil.project` method that is the opposite of `getProjectedIds`. The combination of `getProjectedIds` and `project` should always be the same schema, with empty structs.\r\n* Update all calls to `select` and avoid passing the result of `getProjectedIds` because of the behavior change. In some cases, this will actually fix behavior: `StructProjection.create(Schema base, Schema projection)` should use `project` to preserve empty structs, for example. But other places, like `BaseTableScan.lazyColumnProjection` can avoid calling `getProjectedIds` because it isn't needed (and would change behavior).\r\n* Update most calls that need to produce a schema matching the expected schema to use `project` instead of `select` so that empty structs are preserved.\r\n* Fix the second bug, which is unrelated but also incorrect.\r\n\r\nI think that should fix this. To me, that seems like a couple of PRs: one to add `TypeUtil.project` that will produce empty structs instead of fully-selected structs (maybe just a boolean option to configure `PruneColumns`). Then one PR to update the behavior of `getProjectedIds` and fix `select` calls that use the result to correctly call `project` or avoid `getProjectedIds`. And finally, one PR to fix the second bug.\r\n\r\nDoes that sound reasonable?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/890564959/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/890568188","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2892#issuecomment-890568188","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2892","id":890568188,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX841FP38","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-01T18:48:16Z","updated_at":"2021-08-01T18:48:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@openinx, if you want to add this, please merge it.

My inclination is to not to require canonicalization. It's more work and there may be legitimate uses of signalling NaNs. Plus, I just looked into signalling NaN values and they are evidently not part of the IEEE 754 spec and differ between processors:\r\n\r\n> Encodings of qNaN and sNaN are not specified in IEEE 754 and implemented differently on different processors. ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-precision_floating-point_format#Single-precision_examples))\r\n\r\n@findepi, in IEEE 754, the sign bit is independent of whether a value is NaN (exponent bits are all set and significand is non-zero). That means there are legitimate -NaN values and it would be reasonable for another language to sort them that way. I think that there is no need to change the handling of -NaN values in the spec.\r\n\r\nIt's also reasonable for Java to not distinguish between -NaN and NaN values and to only produce positive NaNs. The only update I would make is to ensure that the Java implementation only writes positive NaN values to align with its sort. In most cases, no changes are needed because we track NaN values through counts after identifying them with `Float.isNaN` or `Double.isNaN`. The only cases that would need to be updated are when engines write -NaN values into files *and* are sorting them. Those engines would be responsible for converting -NaN to NaN or to implement the sort order according to the spec rather than using the default Java comparison.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/890592412/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/890605206","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2284#issuecomment-890605206","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2284","id":890605206,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX841FY6W","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-01T23:23:35Z","updated_at":"2021-08-01T23:23:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm going to close this because I made the updates in #2906.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/890605206/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/890608366","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2761#issuecomment-890608366","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2761","id":890608366,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX841FZru","user":{"login":"kbendick","id":9833362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MzMzNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9833362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick","html_url":"https://github.com/kbendick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-01T23:43:36Z","updated_at":"2021-08-01T23:43:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> > I think there might be some arrow stuff to add, but that might be outdated.

I can do that with a separated PR, and I was hoping this can get into 0.12.0 since we have voted to finalize format v2. It would be a bit awkward if the spec is finalized but people cannot try it out. Please let me know if this is possible.

This would still keep the folder hierarchy, but would allow you to spread data files across multiple partitions.\r\n\r\nTo be able to have full control over the data layout, you can implement your own LocationProvider and then set `write.location-provider.impl`.

If in your sence you found there is too much pos-delete in one checkpoint inteval you can try config this configuration and add you flink job memory. At most sence 100_000 is enough.

Is there a good way to make this happen in parallel instead?\r\n\r\nWhat we discussed elsewhere was doing a compaction by adding a new parallel stage and second committer after the initial committer. The current commit task would output committed `DataFile` instances after the commit succeeds. Then those would be sent to compaction writers using `keyBy` and the partition. Once a compacted data file is large enough, the compaction writer will emit it as a `DataFile` along with the `DataFile` instances that were compacted. Those would be collected by the compaction committer, which would commit a rewrite every checkpoint where there is at least one compacted file.\r\n\r\nI think that we should plan on having some
