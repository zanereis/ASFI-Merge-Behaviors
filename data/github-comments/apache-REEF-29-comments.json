first build of this in VS or from the command line succeeds, and produces a DLL of ~42MB. I'll report on test results using that build separately.\n\nHowever, subsequent builds fail, both from the command line and in Visual Studio. The reason is that the first build adds a file, `lang/cs/Org.Apache.REEF.Client/Properties/Resources.resx`. This file doesn't have the proper license header, hence RAT fails. Also, this file is shown in `git status` after the build, and we run the risk of adding it to the repository which would be good to avoid for build output.\n\nIs it possible to move generated files into output folders of the project in .NET? On the Java side, we put them into `target/` and its subfolders. That folder is ignored by both Git and RAT. Also, it makes `clean` a much more deterministic build target.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/128191994/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/128192748","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/328#issuecomment-128192748","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/328","id":128192748,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyODE5Mjc0OA==","user":{"login":"markusweimer","id":502371,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjM3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/502371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer","html_url":"https://github.com/markusweimer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-06T00:26:19Z","updated_at":"2015-08-06T00:26:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Test results are in.
