Specifically for the length() function we should emulate hive. Here is the hive logic converted to scala:\n\n```\ndef len(s : String)  = {\n  if (s == null) {\n    null\n  } else {\n    @inline def isUtfStartByte(b : Byte) = (b & 0xC0) != 0x80\n    s.getBytes.foldLeft(0) { case (cnt, b) => {\n      cnt + (if (isUtfStartByte(b)) 1 else 0)\n    }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nSo \n    len(\"\\u0123abc\")\n\nreturns 4\n\nLEN(GTH):\n\nGiven the above, which incorporates your observation of the Hive logic: \n\nthe length() method returns either:\n   (a) if not a string: the length of param.toString  .  eg length(12345678) = 8\n   (b) if a string: len(param) where len() is the hive-converted method shown above \n\nSTRLEN:\n\nThe more challenging step is to determine the semantics and implementation of the strlen() function.\n\nSemantics:  \n\nThe intention is to be able to obtain different results for the string length based on the provided encoding.\n\nHere is my proposed canonical example: \n\n```\n strlen(\"\\uF93D\\uF936\\uF949\\uF942\", \"ISO-8859-1\") = 4\n strlen(\"\\uF93D\\uF936\\uF949\\uF942\", \"UTF-8\") = 4\n strlen(\"\\uF93D\\uF936\\uF949\\uF942\", \"UTF-16\") = 2\n strlen(\"\\uF93D\\uF936\\uF949\\uF942\", \"UTF-16\") = 1\n```\n\nImplementation:\n\nSo the question outstanding is:\n\nHow to do platform independent conversion of the representation (bytes?) of a string \"\\uF93D\\uF936\\uF949\\uF942\" to obtain above results?\n\nThe len() helper function above does NOT work that way.
