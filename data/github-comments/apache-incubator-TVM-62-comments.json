I think they are closely related to the current issue as well. Both examples show cases, where problem is clearly exists, but BoundsChecker can't be used effectively.\r\n\r\nBoth programs below perform operations on intermediate tensor `c` while computing final tensor `d`:\r\n\r\n#### Uninitialized data passed to computations\r\n\r\nIn this case we use `c` merely by copying its elements with certain offset. Originally, this example was aimed at simulating user error causing a SegFault, but the compiler treated it in a more interesting way.\r\n```\r\ndef demo_array2():\r\n  with tvm.build_config(instrument_bound_checkers=True):\r\n    a = tvm.placeholder((10,), name='a')\r\n    b = tvm.placeholder((10,), name='b')\r\n    c = tvm.compute((10,), lambda i: a[i]+b[i], name='c')\r\n    d = tvm.compute((10,), lambda i: c[i+100500], name='d')\r\n\r\n     run_tvm(0,1,\r\n            { a:np.ones(get_shape(a)).astype(np.float32)\r\n            , b:np.ones(get_shape(b)).astype(np.float32)\r\n            },d, debug=True)\r\n\r\n```\r\nIn this case TVM generates the code below. Note the correct allocation and `if(0)` in the `produce c` statement. As a result, `c` is passed to `d` uninitialized. User have no chance to notice their mistake quickly.\r\n\r\n```\r\n// attr [c] storage_scope = \"global\"\r\nallocate c[float32 * 10]\r\nproduce c {\r\n  for (i, 0, 10) {\r\n    if (likely((uint1)0)) {\r\n      c[i] = (a[(i + 100500)] + b[(i + 100500)])\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nproduce d {\r\n  for (i, 0, 10) {\r\n    d[i] = c[i]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Uninitialized data + fallacious allocations \r\n\r\nIn this version we make the `c` usage pattern a bit more complex. \r\n```\r\ndef demo_array3():\r\n  with tvm.build_config(instrument_bound_checkers=True):\r\n    a = tvm.placeholder((10,), name='a')\r\n    b = tvm.placeholder((10,), name='b')\r\n    c = tvm.compute((10,), lambda i: a[i]+b[i], name='c')\r\n    d = tvm.compute((10,), lambda i: c[i]*c[i+100500], name='d')\r\n\r\n    run_tvm(0,1,\r\n            { a:np.ones(get_shape(a)).astype(np.float32)\r\n            , b:np.ones(get_shape(b)).astype(np.float32)\r\n            },d, debug=True)\r\n\r\n```\r\nAs before, `c` is passed uninitialized, but In this case TVM makes decision to increase the size of `c` and its axis, consuming lots of memory potentially. Resulting IR:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// attr [c] storage_scope = \"global\"\r\nallocate c[float32 * 100510]\r\nproduce c {\r\n  for (i, 0, 100510) {\r\n    if (likely((i < 10))) {\r\n      c[i] = (a[i] + b[i])\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nproduce d {\r\n  for (i, 0, 10) {\r\n    d[i] = (c[i]*c[(i + 100500)])\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Results\r\nThis examples demonstrate how a typo from user may remain undetected and lead to bugs which are hard to debug. We see that uninitialized data is passed to computations in both examples. It may spread NaNs or even become a security concern. In the last example TVM decides to alter the size of intermediate tensor.\r\n\r\nIn general, It is clear that the compiler should be able to reduce tensors during optimizations, i.e. in `cache_write` case mentioned by @sgrechanik-h. In the same time, I can't imagine when do we need to increase the size of a tensor.\r\n\r\nSo far we saw negative results of this feature. @tqchen @junrushao1994 could you please name some cases where tensor expansion is a desired behavior?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/442039342/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/442050807","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2079#issuecomment-442050807","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2079","id":442050807,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MjA1MDgwNw==","user":{"login":"denis0x0D","id":25140014,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTQwMDE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25140014?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/denis0x0D","html_url":"https://github.com/denis0x0D","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denis0x0D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denis0x0D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denis0x0D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denis0x0D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denis0x0D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denis0x0D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denis0x0D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denis0x0D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denis0x0D/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-27T13:04:24Z","updated_at":"2018-11-27T15:41:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@xqdan \r\n\r\n> for loop partition, please make sure we can insert correct assert for tail loop body, that is the thing I wanna emphasize.

The size of the buffer could be increased by Allocate node, we check that too.\r\n\r\nExample of the condition for spliting const loop :\r\n```\r\n 368 produce compute {\r\n 369   for (i.outer, 0, 5) {\r\n 370     for (i.inner, 0, 4) {\r\n 371       // attr [compute] buffer_bound = 21\r\n 372       // attr [B] buffer_bound = 21\r\n 373       // attr [A] buffer_bound = 21\r\n 374       if (((((int64(((i.outer*4) + i.inner)) >= (int64)0) && (int64(((i.outer*4) + i.inner)) < int64(21)))      && ((int64(((i.outer*4) + i.inner)) >= (int64)0) && (int64(((i.outer*4) + i.inner)) < int64(21)))) && ((int     64(((i.outer*4) + i.inner)) >= (int64)0) && (int64(((i.outer*4) + i.inner)) < int64(21))))) {\r\n 375         compute[((i.outer*4) + i.inner)] = (A[((i.outer*4) + i.inner)] + B[((i.outer*4) + i.inner)])\r\n 376       } else {\r\n 377         assert(((((int64(((i.outer*4) + i.inner)) >= (int64)0) && (int64(((i.outer*4) + i.inner)) < int64(2     1))) && ((int64(((i.outer*4) + i.inner)) >= (int64)0) && (int64(((i.outer*4) + i.inner)) < int64(21)))) &&      ((int64(((i.outer*4) + i.inner)) >= (int64)0) && (int64(((i.outer*4) + i.inner)) < int64(21)))), \"OUT OF TH     E BOUNDS\")\r\n 378         1\r\n 379       }\r\n 380     }\r\n 381   }\r\n 382   for (i.inner, 0, 1) {\r\n 383     // attr [compute] buffer_bound = 21\r\n 384     // attr [B] buffer_bound = 21\r\n 385     // attr [A] buffer_bound = 21\r\n 386     if (((((int64((i.inner + 20)) >= (int64)0) && (int64((i.inner + 20)) < int64(21))) && ((int64((i.inner      + 20)) >= (int64)0) && (int64((i.inner + 20)) < int64(21)))) && ((int64((i.inner + 20)) >= (int64)0) && (in     t64((i.inner + 20)) < int64(21))))) {\r\n 387       compute[(i.inner + 20)] = (A[(i.inner + 20)] + B[(i.inner + 20)])\r\n 388     } else {\r\n 389       assert(((((int64((i.inner + 20)) >= (int64)0) && (int64((i.inner + 20)) < int64(21))) && ((int64((i.i     nner + 20)) >= (int64)0) && (int64((i.inner + 20)) < int64(21)))) && ((int64((i.inner + 20)) >= (int64)0) &     & (int64((i.inner + 20)) < int64(21)))), \"OUT OF THE BOUNDS\")\r\n 390       1\r\n 391     }\r\n 392   }\r\n 393 }\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n> Tensorize is in scheduleOps pass, which is before storage flatten. inject copy is another codegen pass which is after flatten, looks not hard to work with this pr. but for tensorize, we need more discussion.\r\n\r\n@xqdan  thanks for example\r\n\r\n> for inject copy intrin pass, the reason of failure is the if stmt inserted, we need to support assert if in this pass. we can fix this issue in another PR.\r\n\r\n@tmoreau89 @xqdan It looks like the support for VTA backed is more complicated then I was thinking.\r\nI'm not really sure how the check should be implemented in case the default TVM IR is mapping to VTA instrinsics, should it be like\r\n\r\n>  VTACheckMemAccess\r\n\r\nwhich inserts before VTALoadBuffer*, and checks the out of the bound, but I'm not sure about this.\r\n```\r\n  1 // attr [A_buf] storage_scope = \"local.acc_buffer\"\r\n  2 // attr [iter_var(vta, , vta)] coproc_scope = 2\r\n  3 produce A_buf {\r\n  4   VTALoadBuffer2D(tvm_thread_context(VTATLSCommandHandle()), A, 0, 64, 1, 64, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3)\r\n  5 }\r\n  6 produce B_buf {\r\n  7   VTALoadBuffer2D(tvm_thread_context(VTATLSCommandHandle()), B, 0, 64, 1, 64, 0, 0, 0, 0, 64, 3)\r\n  8 }\r\n  9 // attr [iter_var(vta, , vta)] coproc_uop_scope = \"VTAPushALUOp\"\r\n 10 produce C_buf {\r\n 11   VTAUopLoopBegin(64, 1, 1, 0)\r\n 12   VTAUopPush(1, 0, 64, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0)\r\n 13   VTAUopLoopEnd()\r\n 14 }\r\n 15 vta.coproc_dep_push(2, 3)\r\n 16 // attr [iter_var(vta, , vta)] coproc_scope = 3\r\n 17 vta.coproc_dep_pop(2, 3)\r\n 18 produce C {\r\n 19   VTAStoreBuffer2D(tvm_thread_context(VTATLSCommandHandle()), 64, 4, C, 0, 64, 1, 64)\r\n 20 }\r\n 21 vta.coproc_sync()\r\n 22\r\n 23 Initialize VTACommandHandle...\r\n 24 Successful vector add test!\r\n 25 Close VTACommandhandle...\r\n\r\n```\r\n@tqchen @tmoreau89 @ZihengJiang @yzhliu @xqdan @sgrechanik-h Anyway should we create another PR to support Bound Checkers for VTA ?

(Unfortunately it doesn't solve my case of incorrect simplification anyway).\r\n\r\nI would still vote for Euclidean division, and concerning its problems, I would suggest the following plan:\r\n- Rename Div and Mod in IR to EuclideanDiv and EuclideanMod\r\n- Add explicit functions like euclidean_div, truncated_div, etc into the python interface. The ordinary `/` and `%` operators should be translated into expressions checking that their arguments are non-negative and throwing an exception or something like that when they are negative.\r\n- Add a pass rewriting EuclideanDiv in terms of truncated div. As a result, select expressions will appear, but I think they can be effectively eliminated in most cases even with the existing integer set analysis and simplification. Of course, we have to think about some kind of performance regression testing before doing this.\r\n\r\nIf we choose truncated division, then we should do something with the HalideIR simplifier, because it is used everywhere and is heavily relied upon, and we cannot just replace it with CanonicalSimplify yet.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/442879881/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
