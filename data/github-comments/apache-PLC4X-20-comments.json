Lukas,\r\n\r\nIt took me some time to evaluate that because of the strangeness of the case.\r\n\r\nIn Siemens communications, they do not update \"TPDU Number\" at the COTP link layer, it is always zero.\r\n\r\nThe TPDU if used incrementally at the S7 layer\r\n\r\nThe Siemens CPs discard this field, which is why the driver works, but in the particular case of the Odot equipment it will take it into account and expect it to always be zero.\r\n\r\nI tested the driver against the CP 443-1 (S7-400) and everything worked without problems.\r\n\r\nAs indicated, there are other functionalities in the driver that form the message including the COTP layer (diagnosis request, subscription, etc.), which I must evaluate.\r\n\r\nKind

... ok from having a look at the wireshark capture, I think I can explain why the reading of booleans doesn't work ... it seems your system is Little-Endian and I think the system would expect a boolean true to be tranmitted \"0x0100\" but instead it is \"0x0001\" ... Also do I notice, that you seem to be opening and closing the connection every few seconds. Have you thought of using the ConnectionCache? This should dramatically reduce the speed of the connection. \r\n\r\nI'd really love to iron this out on Little-Endian devices, but as I mentioned before, it's super tricky and takes a lot longer to do so. I can see in the decoding that the code for parsing and serializing booleans probably doesn't work as expected for Little-Endian systems also do I think parsing a float BE and then rearranging the bytes is the wrong order when writing. \r\n\r\nIt would probably be super easy to test with a real device, but without I will have to give up as it would be unfair for the other folks who are also waiting in this wall of issues that has been growing over the last few weeks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/2252988963/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/2253019623","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/plc4x/issues/1697#issuecomment-2253019623","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/1697","id":2253019623,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBtifa86GSlnn","user":{"login":"chrisdutz","id":651105,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MTEwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/651105?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdutz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-26T15:38:33Z","updated_at":"2024-07-26T15:38:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ok ...

I do hope that plc4x will become better and that those who put in the effort will be rewarded. If you are interested, I can mention supporting open source to our project manager. But I'm not sure if it can be approved, it depends on various reasons, and the price is just one of them (we have already done an inquiry for kepserver, 16000 RMB). So, I would like to know the specific price?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/2253790696/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/2254011117","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/plc4x/issues/1646#issuecomment-2254011117","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/1646","id":2254011117,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBtifa86GWXrt","user":{"login":"chrisdutz","id":651105,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MTEwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/651105?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdutz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-27T07:56:22Z","updated_at":"2024-07-27T07:56:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yeah...

To make matter worse, drivers deal with situation where plc4j type (int) can be mapped to several plc types (sint, uint, dint).\r\n\r\nFrom API point of view I believe we could guarantee consistency only when caller provides instance of `PlcValue`. Wrapper type clearly specifies data type intended by caller, and can be used by driver to assume wire encoding.\r\nFor other cases we can just try to unify logic through construction of `PlcValue` in single place.
