@HeartSaVioR!\r\n\r\nAs it turned out, the proposed changes do not work correctly for an upgrade to Spark models 1.1. \r\nI tested the changes only for a new installation(with no existing entities in the HBase).\r\n\r\nI guess `relationshipCategory` can be updated only via a patch. An attempt to upgrade with proposed changes leads to:\r\n```\r\n2020-02-28 09:57:11,783 ERROR - [main:] ~ graph rollback due to exception  (GraphTransactionInterceptor:167)\r\norg.apache.atlas.exception.AtlasBaseException: invalid  update for relationship spark_ml_model_ml_directory: new relationshipDef category AGGREGATION, existing relationshipDef category COMPOSITION\r\n        at org.apache.atlas.repository.store.graph.v2.AtlasRelationshipDefStoreV2.preUpdateCheck(AtlasRelationshipDefStoreV2.java:432)\r\n```\r\nit's possible to use the following path to update this property\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"patches\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"id\":              \"TYPEDEF_PATCH_1000_015_001\",\r\n            \"description\":     \"Update relationshipCategory to AGGREGATION\",\r\n            \"action\":          \"REMOVE_LEGACY_REF_ATTRIBUTES\",\r\n            \"typeName\":        \"spark_ml_model_ml_directory\",\r\n            \"applyToVersion\":  \"1.0\",\r\n            \"updateToVersion\": \"1.1\",\r\n            \"params\": {\r\n                \"relationshipCategory\": \"AGGREGATION\"\r\n            }\r\n        },\r\n        ...\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\nhowever, there is no way to update `endDefs` types. I can not find a patch action for this purpose and an attempt to update it directly in the model file leads to:\r\n```\r\n2020-02-28 12:14:05,151 INFO  - [main:] ~ GraphTransaction intercept for org.apache.atlas.repository.store.graph.v2.AtlasTypeDefGraphStoreV2.createUpdateTypesDef (GraphTransactionAdvisor$1:41)\r\n2020-02-28 12:14:05,213 ERROR - [main:] ~ graph rollback due to exception  (GraphTransactionInterceptor:167)\r\norg.apache.atlas.exception.AtlasBaseException: invalid update for relationshipDef spark_ml_model_ml_directory: new end2 AtlasRelationshipEndDef{type='DataSet', name==>'model', description==>'null', isContainer==>'false', cardinality==>'SINGLE', isLegacyAttribute==>'false'}, existing end2 AtlasRelationshipEndDef{type='spark_ml_directory', name==>'model', description==>'null', isContainer==>'false', cardinality==>'SINGLE', isLegacyAttribute==>'false'}\r\n        at org.apache.atlas.repository.store.graph.v2.AtlasRelationshipDefStoreV2.preUpdateCheck(AtlasRelationshipDefStoreV2.java:457)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThus, it seems that the safest way to resolve this issue will be **creating a new relationship**.\r\nI tried to add the next relationship defs that use the same name `directory`:\r\n```\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"spark_ml_model_dataset\",\r\n      \"serviceType\": \"spark\",\r\n      \"typeVersion\": \"1.0\",\r\n      \"relationshipCategory\": \"AGGREGATION\",\r\n      \"endDef1\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"spark_ml_model\",\r\n        \"name\": \"directory\",\r\n        \"isContainer\": true,\r\n        \"cardinality\": \"SINGLE\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"endDef2\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"DataSet\",\r\n        \"name\": \"model\",\r\n        \"isContainer\": false,\r\n        \"cardinality\": \"SINGLE\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"propagateTags\": \"NONE\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"spark_ml_pipeline_dataset\",\r\n      \"serviceType\": \"spark\",\r\n      \"typeVersion\": \"1.0\",\r\n      \"relationshipCategory\": \"AGGREGATION\",\r\n      \"endDef1\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"spark_ml_pipeline\",\r\n        \"name\": \"directory\",\r\n        \"isContainer\": true,\r\n        \"cardinality\": \"SINGLE\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"endDef2\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"DataSet\",\r\n        \"name\": \"pipeline\",\r\n        \"isContainer\": false,\r\n        \"cardinality\": \"SINGLE\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"propagateTags\": \"NONE\"\r\n    }\r\n``` \r\n\r\nand it works perfectly fine for the `spark_ml_model` but fails for the `spark_ml_pipeline` with the following error:\r\n```\r\n2020-02-28 21:34:00,933 WARN  - [NotificationHookConsumer thread-0:] ~ Max retries exceeded for message {\"version\":{\"version\":\"1.0.0\",\"versionParts\":[1]},\"msgCompressionKind\":\"NONE\",\"msgSplitIdx\":1,\"msgSplitCount\":1,\"msgCreationTime\":1582918440918,\"message\":{\"type\":\"ENTITY_CREATE_V2\",\"user\":\"test\",\"entities\":{\"entities\":[{\"typeName\":\"spark_ml_model\",\"attributes\":{\"qualifiedName\":\"model_with_path8\",\"name\":\"model_with_path8\"},\"guid\":\"-386799758271978\",\"isIncomplete\":false,\"provenanceType\":0,\"version\":0,\"relationshipAttributes\":{\"directory\":{\"typeName\":\"hdfs_path\",\"uniqueAttributes\":{\"qualifiedName\":\"path8\"}}},\"proxy\":false}]}}} (NotificationHookConsumer$HookConsumer:793)\r\norg.apache.atlas.exception.AtlasBaseException: invalid relationshipDef: spark_ml_model_ml_directory: end type 1: spark_ml_directory, end type 2: spark_ml_model\r\n\tat org.apache.atlas.repository.store.graph.v2.AtlasRelationshipStoreV2.validateRelationship(AtlasRelationshipStoreV2.java:657)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nDebugging shows that [AtlasEntityUtil.getRelationshipType](https://github.com/apache/atlas/blob/master/repository/src/main/java/org/apache/atlas/repository/store/graph/v2/EntityGraphMapper.java#L659) returns `null` for the `hdfs_path`(which is child of `DataSet`) attribute and this makes [entityType.getRelationshipAttribute](https://github.com/apache/atlas/blob/master/intg/src/main/java/org/apache/atlas/type/AtlasEntityType.java#L459) return first value of HashMap. \r\n\r\nIn the case of `spark_ml_model` relation, it appears to be the right relation, but in the case of `spark_ml_pipeline` - the wrong one.
