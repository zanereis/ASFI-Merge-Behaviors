handling becomes quite important and more tricky now. I think we need to handle it appropriately if kafka timestamp becomes the default.\r\n\r\n - LogAppendTime : \r\n    - We could handle it by keeping minimum timestamp we have seen across the partitions (also update it only after we know have tried to read from the partition with lowest timestamp). i.e. upto 1 sec latency. \r\n - with createTime: \r\n   - `¯\\_(ツ)_/¯`\r\n   - May be we need to do something like what PubsubIO. Delay a minute or so..\r\n  \r\nCurrent watermark is ok only because of processing time. If we make new timestamps the default, it could be surprising to unsuspecting users. What do you think?\r\n\r\n`LogAppendTime` might be the most common use case. It might be good enough for now to handle that. This would handle backlogged pipelines very nicely.
