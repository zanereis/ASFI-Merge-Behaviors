The progress should be saved to Storm's Zookeeper. The OpaquePartitionedTridentKafkaSpout should be getting passed the previous batch's ending offset as part of the metadata passed to emitPartitionBatch.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not very experienced with how Trident works internally, but from what I can tell, the spout will be asked to emit a batch with a given transaction id via emitPartitionBatch, as well as some metadata for the last batch. The return value is some metadata that can be used to construct the following batch later. In Kafka's case the metadata is the starting and end offsets for the batch. The metadata is saved to Zookeeper once state has been committed for the batch. When a batch succeeds, the metadata for earlier batches are removed from Zookeeper. If the spout worker is restarted, the last committed metadata is read back from Zookeeper, which should determine which offset the spout restarts at.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/64e29f365c9b5d3e15b33f33ab64e200345333e4/storm-client/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/trident/spout/OpaquePartitionedTridentSpoutExecutor.java\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/64e29f365c9b5d3e15b33f33ab64e200345333e4/storm-client/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/trident/spout/OpaquePartitionedTridentSpoutExecutor.java</a> is the code that wraps around the OpaquePartitionedTridentKafkaSpout.

OpaquePartitionedTridentSpoutExecutor will create instances of each of these, based on the partition ids returned by the spout emitter. For example, for me the Zookeeper path for metadata for the Trident spout in examples/storm-kafka-client-examples TridentKafkaClientWordCountNamedTopics was /transactional/spout1/user/test-trident@0 and /transactional/spout1/user/test-trident-1@0. The path format for the kafka spout is /$transactional.zookeeper.root/$spoutComponentName/user/$topicName@partitionNumber. </p>\n\n<p>When I ran the TridentKafkaWordCountNamedTopics example on master, shut it down and restarted it, I think I got the behavior you described. Here is the Zookeeper metadata after I shut down the example topology the first time:</p>\n<div class=\"code panel\" style=\"border-width: 1px;\"><div class=\"codeContent panelContent\">\n<pre class=\"code-java\">get /transactional/spout1/user/test-trident@0/6204\norg.apache.storm.kafka.spout.trident.KafkaTridentSpoutBatchMetadata@507e1faf{topicPartition=test-trident-0, firstOffset=1412, lastOffset=1412}\n</pre>\n</div></div>\n<p>After restart</p>\n<div class=\"code panel\" style=\"border-width: 1px;\"><div class=\"codeContent panelContent\">\n<pre class=\"code-java\">get /transactional/spout1/user/test-trident@0/6271\norg.apache.storm.kafka.spout.trident.KafkaTridentSpoutBatchMetadata@50982f4e{topicPartition=test-trident-0, firstOffset=71, lastOffset=71}\n</pre>\n</div></div>\n<p>I tried logging the RotatingTransactionalState on creation.</p>\n<div class=\"code panel\" style=\"border-width: 1px;\"><div class=\"codeContent panelContent\">\n<pre class=\"code-java\">2017-08-03 17:44:37.767 o.a.s.t.t.s.RotatingTransactionalState <span class=\"code-object\">Thread</span>-26-spout-spout1-executor[10, 10] [DEBUG] Created RotatingTransactionalState{_state=org.apache.storm.trident.topology.state.TransactionalState@29823124, _subdir=<span class=\"code-quote\">'test-trident@0'</span>, _curr={6204=<span class=\"code-keyword\">null</span>}} org.apache.storm.trident.topology.state.RotatingTransactionalState.<init>(RotatingTransactionalState.java:47)\n</pre>\n</div></div>\n<p>The txid is correct, but the associated metadata object is null, which causes the spout to restart.</p>\n\n<p>I looked into it a bit more, and it turns out the TransactionalState code assumes the metadata object can be round trip serialized/deserialized with the json-simple library. When json-simple can't figure out how to json serialize an object, it'll instead quietly return the object's toString (IMO it should be throwing an exception instead of quietly doing the wrong thing). That's what ends up being saved to Zookeeper for the Kafka spout, and our metadata object's toString doesn't return json. When TransactionalState tries to load the metadata back in from Zookeeper, it (apparently deliberately) uses a method from json-simple that quietly returns null if json parsing fails. The result is that we end up both quietly failing to write the metadata properly to Zookeeper, and quietly fail to read the incorrectly serialized data back. The spout ends up restarting every time the executor is rebooted, because it can't read the data in Zookeeper.

I'd also like to change the handling of first poll strategy a bit, because it's inconsistent with the way it works for the regular spout. Right now there is no real difference between UNCOMMITED_EARLIEST/LATEST and EARLIEST/LATEST. I think we should change it so if the strategy is EARLIEST/LATEST and isFirstPoll is true, it should seek to start/end even if lastBatchMeta is set. That's how the regular spout works, it ignores how far any previous instances got when it restarts.

What we really get is performance improvement with single-thread: we reduced more than half of time than before.\r\n\r\nThe value of ‘skip checking update count' should be reasonable to answer the question: \"Are we OK to delay updating load information if less than N (the value) calls occurred within 1 sec?\" We may want to put better efforts to find the value (given that test results was not stable enough), but at least from test result, 100 seems be a good value. Higher value doesn't show linear performance improvement.\r\n\r\nBtw, update duration (M secs) is another variable to explore.

And for BackPressure mode when spout/bolt cant write to downstream bolt's full queue. The wait strategy implementation for the case when spout has no data to emit remains unchanged. The new \"Progressive\" Wait strategy is a dynamic strategy that can go into deeper wait states progressively. It can be tuned to be more/less conservative  ... if the user desires to make different tradeoffs in latency, CPU usage and throughput.\r\n\r\n2) **Changes to default settings:** - So far my defaults where aggressively geared towards optimizing high throughput cases.  Based on the concerns I have received, I have tweaked them to favor tight latency(batchSz=1), and also conserving cpu usage under low/medium throughput(SleepStrategy Settings).  So high throughput modes may see some impact depending on topology.\r\n\r\n@revans2 To summarize the problems you have brought up so far:\r\n\r\n- **At low throughput, latency is poor**  This issue was do due to defaults not being suited for these modes (primarily flushtuple period=5seconds). New defaults should work better. For High throughput modes, batching  & flushtuple rate will need to be customized.\r\n- **At low throughputs, high CPU usage**: This was due to the missing wait strategy. That should also get addressed by the introduction of sleep strategy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI want to make a few points to be considered for test runs:\r\n-  Ideally, settings need to be tweaked appropriately for low throughput v/s high throughput vs latency centric runs. Using the same defaults for all will yield suboptimal numbers on some end of spectrum. My little tips for this PR: For higher throughput modes:, batchSz=~1000, additional ackers and finally consider less frequent flushing if its not impacting latency.\r\n\r\n- My rule-of-thumb for optimal executor count : If spout/bolt executors are likely to be very busy (high throughput modes), then 1 executor per physical core is a good sweet spot for overall perf. ACKers (if enabled) and also WorkerTransferThd (in multiworker mode) would require their own core as they tend to stay very busy. \r\n\r\n- max.spout.pending will be needed in high-throughput multi-worker runs due to the netty client issue raised by Bobby.\r\n\r\n- Bottlenecks: ACKer is a known throughput bottleneck. The inter-Worker path bottlenecks around ~2.8 mil/sec with STORM-2306.\r\n\r\n- Worth trying some runs with ACK disabled as well as Back Pressure mode.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/320371987/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2613030639","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/6459#issuecomment-2613030639","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/6459","id":2613030639,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTMwMzA2Mzk=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-05T03:11:36Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T17:19:46Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=kabhwan\">kabhwan</a>:</i>\n<p>Thanks <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=vinodkc\" class=\"user-hover\" rel=\"vinodkc\">Vinod KC</a>, I merged into 1.x, 1.1.x, 1.0.x branches.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2613030639/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/320391375","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2251#issuecomment-320391375","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2251","id":320391375,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMDM5MTM3NQ==","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-05T03:12:55Z","updated_at":"2017-08-05T03:12:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vinodkc I merged this with some modification (commit title) but auto-close didn't work because it is pointing to non master branch.

For such cases, we need to be clear if we guarantee whether the emit path is thread safe or not. \r\n\r\n**My thoughts:** We should not guarantee that OutputCollector path is thread safe. If users chose to spin up threads in their spouts/bolts, they need to handle synchronization as well. The advantage of doing so is that we get a much faster path for majority of the spouts and bolts which don’t do this kind of stuff.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if we support unsynchronized concurrent emits, then much of that emit path needs to be slowed down with internal synchronization locks (ensuring thread safety in executor.transferLocal, executor.transferRemote, batching logic, all groupings etc).  \r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, neither the existing code base nor STORM-2306 support such unsynchronized concurrent emits. But its good to be explicit about that to users.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/320866648/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612468804","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4182#issuecomment-2612468804","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4182","id":2612468804,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI0Njg4MDQ=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-08T08:50:35Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T12:55:17Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a

Because of this we documented that users should put their own synchronization around calls to emit, but this proved to be incorrect (or more accurately insufficient).

When this happens synchronizing within a single bolt\r\n\r\n```\r\nsynchronized(this) {\r\n   collector.emit(...);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nis not enough to ensure safety, because `this` is different for each of the bolts.  It is non-intuitive, but the only way to really ensure it is safe would be to synchronize on a static singleton lock.  Which is also bad because it synchronizes all of the instances of that bolt in the worker, not just the ones that would be under contention. By the way the ShellBolt emits on a separate thread, just one thread so it was written assuming that it would be safe without synchronization but under this proposal it would require us to change that.\r\n\r\nI made the shuffle grouping thread safe to fix some of these issues, and to make it intuitive for our users too.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/320983047/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/320993989","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2241#issuecomment-320993989","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2241","id":320993989,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMDk5Mzk4OQ==","user":{"login":"revans2","id":3441321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDEzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3441321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2","html_url":"https://github.com/revans2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-08T15:35:30Z","updated_at":"2017-08-08T15:35:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I am really nervous about this patch in general and I am still a -1 on it.\r\n\r\nFor me to remove my -1 at a minimum all of the unit tests have to pass and all critical functionality has to be here (the system bolt metrics are being reported properly).

I will post my results here when I am done.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/320993989/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2613030445","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/6457#issuecomment-2613030445","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/6457","id":2613030445,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTMwMzA0NDU=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-08T17:51:27Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T17:19:40Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=preet\">preet</a>:</i>\n<p>Do we have any SLA for the fix?

Here's some follow-ups:</p>\n\n<p>Firstly, I was a bit unfair in one thing I said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Removal of the ability to launch the daemon like this: backtype.storm.daemon.supervisor.launch(new MesosSupervisor());</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>That would have been <b>intentionally</b> broken when we changed from <tt>backtype</tt> to <tt>org.apache</tt> anyways.  So my focus on the end portion of the call (<tt>...supervisor.launch()</tt> not existing anymore is a bit unfair &#8211; we would have needed to touch the code anyways!</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Could you file an issue regarding this? I'd be really appreciated if you can provide a patch and being a tester. (No one claimed this before so that's a missing point of testing.)</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We should be able to fix these, but it will take a bit of work to be sure that it is all correct. Please file a JIRA against us and assign it to me. I'll do what I can to fix them ASAP.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>I'll make the change & can test it, but thanks for offering to help!  I filed <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-2690\" title=\"resurrect invocation of ISupervisor.assigned() & make Supervisor.launchDaemon() accessible\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-2690\"><del>STORM-2690</del></a> towards this end, I'll \"@\" you two on my PR when it arises. Just FYI, we've found what we believe is a workaround for the problem in storm-mesos, so it's not super urgent, but should probably be fixed before more storm releases percolate out.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>TBH, it would be ideal to support mesos integration officially. Storm officially supports only standalone, and storm-yarn and storm-mesos are supported from community which are hard to catch up Storm development. They're not considered in release verification phase so it's hard to guarantee compatibility between Storm release and community's efforts.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And yes we probably need some step in the release process to look at testing external projects. The ISupervisor interface is really only used by storm mesos right now, as storm-yarn is effectively dead, so it is not always something we pay that much attention to, even though we should.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Yeah, I was under the impression that storm-yarn had died on the vine from previous statements I've read from you Bobby.  It would be nice to get storm-mesos properly integrated into the storm releases themselves &#8211; that will be a long effort I suspect, so for now we'll just hope the interfaces are sufficient.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612944213/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2613030450","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/6457#issuecomment-2613030450","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/6457","id":2613030450,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTMwMzA0NTA=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-08T18:16:30Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T17:19:40Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=srdo\">srdo</a>:</i>\n<p><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=Preet\" class=\"user-hover\" rel=\"Preet\">Preet Puri</a> No promises, but I'm hoping to have a PR up sometime late this week for master.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2613030450/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/321045111","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2268#issuecomment-321045111","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2268","id":321045111,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMTA0NTExMQ==","user":{"login":"srdo","id":4324588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjQ1ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4324588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo","html_url":"https://github.com/srdo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-08T18:40:02Z","updated_at":"2017-08-08T18:40:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"For some reason the integration test can't download Zookeeper.
