IMHO this is not a good way to update vr config. We should only configure things which are changed newly. I think we need to fix this as it is not scalable and redoing the whole config again might result in restarting one or many services like you said is happening with conntrackd. However i think we can fix the conntrackd issue temporarily by copying the conntrackd to some non standard location and run conntrackd using this config file.Currently the config file is copied to a standard location in /etc, doing this will make sure that the conntrackd will not be there when this script runs for the first time. \n\nI do not know of any tests for conntrackd case and for the default routes case in the isolated networks. I think we need to test this manually.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/145441458/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/145445260","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/844#issuecomment-145445260","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/844","id":145445260,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NTQ0NTI2MA==","user":{"login":"ustcweizhou","id":3204966,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDQ5NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3204966?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ustcweizhou","html_url":"https://github.com/ustcweizhou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ustcweizhou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ustcweizhou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ustcweizhou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ustcweizhou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ustcweizhou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ustcweizhou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ustcweizhou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ustcweizhou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ustcweizhou/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-05T06:56:08Z","updated_at":"2015-10-05T06:56:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"guys,

@remibergsma and @bvbharat,\n\nPlease have a look at my comment from 2 days ago. I mentioned that indeed the change would create a regression. So this PR won't get merged with the current change on the copy/copy_if_needed stuff.\n\nI will change it back and also refactor the code of the copy() function, which is not duplicate from the copy_if_needed.\n\nConcerning the current way theVR is being configured - and having the configuration applied every time update_config is called - I agree it's not optimal.\n\nOur plan is to stabilise all the VRs in the coming 2 weeks. If we get the BVTs to work as expected, we will  then move towards the next phase: refactor the persistent configuration, which should be available for a 4.6.1 release.\n\nCheers,\nWilder\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/145473615/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/145488778","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/801#issuecomment-145488778","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/801","id":145488778,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NTQ4ODc3OA==","user":{"login":"krissterckx","id":10531991,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTMxOTkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10531991?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/krissterckx","html_url":"https://github.com/krissterckx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krissterckx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krissterckx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krissterckx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krissterckx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krissterckx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krissterckx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krissterckx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krissterckx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krissterckx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-05T10:21:48Z","updated_at":"2015-10-05T10:21:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I would like to bring attention to the reviewers that only a few CS core extensions were made -

He created a ticket besides this one as he thinks it's unrelated. See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CLOUDSTACK-8935.\n\nBesides the tests which where ran, I tested it manually.
