I should have changed \"./gradlew\" to just \"gradle\" for the .txt and .md files I updated. I also agree that gradlew, not gradle, is the correct usage in Dockerfile.\n\nThe problem here with using gradlew is that it's not part of the release distributions. As part of the source distro we shouldn't be calling out a script that's not part of the package. I realize that this conflicts with the  common usage when building from a clone of the github repo. Any suggestion for handling this disconnect between building from source distro vs. repo clone?
