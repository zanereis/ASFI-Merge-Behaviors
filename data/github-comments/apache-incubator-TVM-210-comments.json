We are also in the process of upgrading the Target specifications, so we might want to look into that later.\r\n\r\nBut my take is that most of the cases should be about runtime availability. \r\n\r\n\r\n ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/686647893/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/686650367","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6342#issuecomment-686650367","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6342","id":686650367,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4NjY1MDM2Nw==","user":{"login":"tmoreau89","id":5974488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQ0ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89","html_url":"https://github.com/tmoreau89","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-03T17:47:57Z","updated_at":"2020-09-03T17:47:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @anilmartha @jtuyls @comaniac @leandron @tqchen the PR has been merged. @leandron and @jtuyls can work together on follow-up improvements as discussed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/686650367/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/686653692","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6351#issuecomment-686653692","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6351","id":686653692,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4NjY1MzY5Mg==","user":{"login":"mbrookhart","id":4065489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNjU0ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4065489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart","html_url":"https://github.com/mbrookhart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-03T17:54:12Z","updated_at":"2020-09-03T17:54:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks to @tmoreau89 for testing some custom models against this branch and finding a regression.

Is that possible to move the pass before partitioning but after merge compiler region (like `PruneTesnorRTCompilerRegion`)? After the merge compiler region pass you should get the Relay graph with almost the same semantic as partitioning. If you could have a pass checking each compiler region for your constraints, you can probably just remove the region you don't want, so that you should get only valid partitioned functions.\r\n\r\n3. Can the TensorRT version be obtained via an API call in C++? Something like `tensorrt::get_version()`? If so you can register a global symbol and pass the version to Python so that it can be used by the annotator.\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef conv2d(...):\r\n    if not tvm.get_global_func(\"relay.tensorrt.version\", True):\r\n        return False\r\n    ver = tvm.get_global_func(\"relay.tensorrt.version\")\r\n    if ver == '1.0':\r\n        return True\r\n    return False\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you need manually set up the TensorRT version, then it could be like this: Let user specify it in `config.cmake` and we pass the value to a macro in C++ so that you could simply return the value. The drawback of this solution is that it needs to rebuild TVM to annotate different TensorRT versions, and I'm not sure if that makes sense to you.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/686777770/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/686779607","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6395#issuecomment-686779607","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6395","id":686779607,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4Njc3OTYwNw==","user":{"login":"zhiics","id":5145158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDUxNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5145158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics","html_url":"https://github.com/zhiics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-03T21:43:21Z","updated_at":"2020-09-03T21:43:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@trevor-m

To me this is the flexibility of AutoTVM. You can customize everything for different purposes, but only upstream the generic one after solid evaluations.\r\n\r\nThe concerns I have for the solution in this PR is that you check and use an attribute `measure_batch` in `Tuner`, but `measure_batch` is not a member of that class. It means you manually add this attribute in runtime for this feature (i.e., `tuner.measure_batch = my_func`) to override the use of local variable. To me, this increases the uncertainty and it's hard to track and maintain in the future. More importantly, `create_measure_batch` is just a wrapper to call the runner, so it seems not necessary to provide the flexibility at this level.\r\n\r\ncc @merrymercy, @tqchen ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/687267906/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/687279729","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/6376#issuecomment-687279729","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6376","id":687279729,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4NzI3OTcyOQ==","user":{"login":"vathysjacob","id":62117709,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMTE3NzA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62117709?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vathysjacob","html_url":"https://github.com/vathysjacob","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vathysjacob/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vathysjacob/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vathysjacob/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vathysjacob/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vathysjacob/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vathysjacob/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vathysjacob/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vathysjacob/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vathysjacob/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-04T17:20:03Z","updated_at":"2020-09-04T17:20:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@tqchen - Sure, I'll take a look.
