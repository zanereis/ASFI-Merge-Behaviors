It is quite common that Put file/blob object processors have the core attribute `${filename}` as their default value. It exists on all FlowFiles so it cannot happen that it has no value (unlike `${azure.blobname}` which is not a standard attribute).\r\n\r\nThe other Azure Blob processors could also be modified to use this `${filename}` (while preserving the legacy `${azure.blobname}` as well for List/Fetch in order to maintain backward compatibility). In this way, the Azure Blob processors would be standardized to the `${filename}` convention.

\r\n\r\nTo answer your first question, \"**does the current implementation implies that all fields of the input record must be used for the prediction?**\"\r\n\r\n- No not all fields of the input record need to be used for the prediction. Going back to your example, if we pass in features `A,B,C` to the MOJO Pipeline, it will filter out the features it doesn't need. So, the MOJO Pipeline will ignore feature `C` and make the prediction for label `D` based on features `A,B`. So, the users won't have to worry about manually removing fields.\r\n\r\nTo answer your second question, \"**what will be the name of the field for the prediction, is there a way to specify/force the name?**\"\r\n\r\n- The MOJO Pipeline already has the prediction field name(s). When the MOJO Pipeline is built in Driverless AI, some of the metadata it is given is the predicted field name(s). In the processor in the predict() method, when I use the MojoPipeline model to make the prediction on the input test data, next I convert the MojoFrame into a predictedRecordMap. This hash map contains key value pairs of one or more predicted field names and field values. Now we have a predictedRecord that also holds one or more predicted field names and field values. So, when the user configures the CSVRecordSetWriter, they can choose \"Inherit Record Schema\" for Schema Access Strategy to get the predicted field names from the predictedRecord.\r\n\r\nAlso I have a GitHub Repo that has 2 NiFi templates and some example data to use the **ExecuteMojoScoringRecord** processor in a Hydraulic System Predictive Maintenance use case. Since this processor uses a Driverless AI MOJO Scoring Pipeline, the user will need a Driverless AI License Key to use the processor.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/james94/Hydraulic-System-Predictive-Maintenance","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/622609665/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/622610153","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4242#issuecomment-622610153","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4242","id":622610153,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMjYxMDE1Mw==","user":{"login":"james94","id":11840449,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODQwNDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11840449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/james94","html_url":"https://github.com/james94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james94/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-01T23:29:30Z","updated_at":"2020-05-01T23:29:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@pvillard31 \r\n\r\nAlso is there a place on the repo or website I can include an example of how to use the processor either through written content or a video walkthrough?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/622610153/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/622650342","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4242#issuecomment-622650342","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4242","id":622650342,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMjY1MDM0Mg==","user":{"login":"joewitt","id":3057465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTc0NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3057465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt","html_url":"https://github.com/joewitt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-02T01:38:34Z","updated_at":"2020-05-02T01:38:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I don’t think this makes sense to include in Apache nifi.

But that will break things for anyone currently using `${filename}` with the Blob processors.\r\n\r\nAlso, arguably, `${path}` is wrong and there's a bug here because that's not the object's path. Comparing all this to `ListFile`, the behavior is different:\r\n\r\n```properties\r\nabsolute.path = /tmp/nifi/test/\r\nfilename = test.txt\r\npath = test/\r\n```\r\n\r\nS3 and GCS might be unique in the way they treat `${filename}`. A lot of processors set `${filename}` to a bare filename. And the other filesystem-oriented `Fetch` processors, if they have a default use `${absolute.path}/${filename}` or `${path}/${filename}`.\r\n\r\nOptions:\r\n1. Go with this PR.\r\n2. Go for consistency with S3 and GCS, change `${filename}` to be the full object name, use it as the default, potentially breaking flows that assume it's the bare filename today.\r\n3. Go for consistency with File, fix `${path}` and default to `${path}/${filename}`, potentially breaking flows using `${path}` today. But `${path}` is wrong, so is anyone using it?\r\n4.
