Also, perhaps not applicable to the average random PR.\r\n\r\nReally like the links to the dev docs and information about VOTEing as it sets the expectation that it may take time to get to being merged. Would be nice if that could be less wordy.  btw, no need to thank folks twice - saved two more words 😄 \r\n\r\nI don't mean to be overly focused on number of words, but if this takes too long to read, it might not have the desired effect. Maybe consider making another pass over the whole thing to see where else the same information could be conveyed with less (particularly the target branch section as that is a typical thing to get wrong). what's the minimum words that could be used to get folks to pick the right branch.\r\n\r\nRegarding (2) i think a combination of emoji and bold text would do the trick, though I assume that a small Gremlin pic somewhere wouldn't hurt. 😃

@hugovk, Thanks for submitting this PR. Due to our branching structure, it would be best for this change to go into `3.6-dev` in order for the change to be incorporated in the existing 3.6.x and 3.7.x release lines, as well as future major releases.\r\nWould you retargetting this PR to the `3.6-dev` branch?\r\n\r\n> Do you still support Python 3.4? I don't think so, but couldn't find the min version documented. Well, this can be also removed if not:\r\n\r\nThanks for catching this. We do not support Python 3.4 anymore. Our current min version is python 3.8, however this will soon be raised to something more modern as 3.8 falls out of support.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/2246350761/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/2246442399","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2694#issuecomment-2246442399","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/2694","id":2246442399,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc6F5f2f","user":{"login":"vkagamlyk","id":7605999,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDU5OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7605999?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkagamlyk","html_url":"https://github.com/vkagamlyk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkagamlyk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkagamlyk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkagamlyk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkagamlyk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkagamlyk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkagamlyk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkagamlyk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkagamlyk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkagamlyk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-23T22:58:55Z","updated_at":"2024-07-23T22:58:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"VOTE+1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/2246442399/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/2247145973","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2692#issuecomment-2247145973","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/2692","id":2247145973,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc6F8Ln1","user":{"login":"hugovk","id":1324225,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjQyMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1324225?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugovk","html_url":"https://github.com/hugovk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugovk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugovk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugovk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugovk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugovk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugovk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugovk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugovk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugovk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-24T07:54:04Z","updated_at":"2024-07-24T07:54:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sure, coming up!\r\n\r\nI didn't fully expect changing the base branch on the PR would work, but I'll rebase locally 😅 \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/2247145973/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/2247213082","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2692#issuecomment-2247213082","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/2692","id":2247213082,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc6F8cAa","user":{"login":"hugovk","id":1324225,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjQyMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1324225?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugovk","html_url":"https://github.com/hugovk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugovk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugovk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugovk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugovk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugovk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugovk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugovk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugovk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugovk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-24T08:27:38Z","updated_at":"2024-07-24T08:27:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Updated!
