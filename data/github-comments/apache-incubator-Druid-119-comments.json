Thanks for the contribution.  We've spent some time looking at it and have wanted something similar to happen in order to enable us to switch from using `ByteBuffer` to using something based on `Unsafe` which should be significantly faster (generally things tend to run in 2/3 the time).\r\n\r\nIn looking at the interfaces, there are a few things that we expect to have real performance implications (one example is the proposal to move everything to big endian, that will actually end up slowing down speeds by about 3x or 4x).  In general, it is important to use native endianness when working with memory mapped files.\r\n\r\nWe are putting together a counter proposal that would actually return the datasketches `Memory` interface instead of the `DataInput` and `DataOutput` interfaces that you borrowed from Lucene.  The hope is that the `Memory` interface will be a bit more in-line with the needs of data processing, hopefully it is also something you can implement on top of your distributed filesystem implementation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/266638386/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/266652707","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/3716#issuecomment-266652707","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3716","id":266652707,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NjY1MjcwNw==","user":{"login":"weijietong","id":728692,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyODY5Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/728692?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijietong","html_url":"https://github.com/weijietong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijietong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijietong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijietong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijietong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijietong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijietong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijietong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijietong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijietong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-13T05:54:11Z","updated_at":"2016-12-13T05:54:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@cheddar Thanks for your reply. First ,I want to explain about byte code order. From what I learned from the current Druid codes, most of the byte code order is big endian ,except the longlong encoding type which uses the native endianness . While implementing this PR ,I also observe this rule, so ,for the mmap default implementation, there is no performance slowing down as you predicated .\r\nFor the `Memory` proposal ,could you give a link ? what about the plan ? I hope that the new proposal should also contain an high abstract interface. Something like `mmap` 、`Unsafe` should be a specific technology implementation, which should be a choice for users to choose or implement by themselves.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/266652707/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/266778011","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/3716#issuecomment-266778011","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3716","id":266778011,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2Njc3ODAxMQ==","user":{"login":"cheddar","id":216778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjc3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/216778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar","html_url":"https://github.com/cheddar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-13T16:00:15Z","updated_at":"2016-12-13T16:01:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@weijietong Yeah, you are right, a lot of the stuff is using big-endian values.

re:\r\n\r\n> That got me wondering if it should be introduced as an extension module?\r\n\r\nThe idea behind making it a core module is that I thought that at some point we would want to add an extension point for SQL UDFs to datasketches, approximate histograms, etc. To make that work, either the UDFs would need to be in the various extensions and they would need to require druid-sql, or the UDFs would need to be in druid-sql and it would need to require the various extensions.\r\n\r\nThe former made more sense to me, and given that implies druid-sql will one day be a dependency of a variety of extensions, it seemed like it belongs in core. Otherwise we get into extensions requiring other extensions that seem only lightly related, and that would be confusing to users.\r\n\r\nIf you have a better idea about how to handle extensions / UDFs with SQL then I am all ears.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/266893907/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/266895379","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/3716#issuecomment-266895379","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3716","id":266895379,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2Njg5NTM3OQ==","user":{"login":"fjy","id":428325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODMyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy","html_url":"https://github.com/fjy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-13T23:29:04Z","updated_at":"2016-12-13T23:29:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@weijietong apologies for the delay.

TCP/IP specifies Big-Endian for the transmission elements, like source/destination address, port, etc, but the endianness for the payload is up to the higher layers.\r\n\r\nThe fact that ByteBuffer uses Big-Endian as the default is historical and likely tied to its early use with socket streams or because Sun used SPARC CPUs. Note that the default for an allocated or wrapped LongBuffer is Native-Order and cannot be changed, while a LongBuffer view inherits its endianness from the parent ByteBuffer.\r\n\r\nToday, Little-Endian is the default for virtually all large systems (Intel and AMD CPUs). The fact that folks did not bother to specify Native-Endian for reading and writing into memory and memory-mapped files is indeed unfortunate as it is very inefficient.\r\n\r\nThe PLMFR concepts in ByteBuffer get in the way if you want to efficiently and arbitrarily read and write arrays and fields into packed data structures in memory or memory-mapped files. \r\n\r\nConsider a toy packed structure similar to: \r\n\r\n    typedef struct {       //offsets\r\n        int intArr[8]      //0\r\n        long longArr[8];   //32\r\n        double dblsArr[8]; //96\r\n    } byteArr\r\n\r\nAnd the task is to write these 3 arrays in reverse order:\r\n\r\nWith ByteBuffer:\r\n\r\n    ByteBuffer bb = ByteBuffer.wrap(byteArr);\r\n    bb.order(ByteOrder.LITTLE_ENDIAN);\r\n    \r\n    bb.position(96);\r\n    DoubleBuffer db = bb.asDoubleBuffer();\r\n    db.put(dblsArr, 0, 8);\r\n    \r\n    bb.position(32);\r\n    LongBuffer lb = bb.asLongBuffer();\r\n    lb.put(longArr, 0, 8);\r\n    \r\n    bb.position(0);\r\n    IntBuffer ib = bb.asIntBuffer();\r\n    ib.put(intArr, 0, 8);\r\n\r\nWith Memory:\r\n\r\n    Memory mem = new NativeMemory(byteArr);\r\n    mem.putDoubleArray(96, dblsArr, 0, 8);\r\n    mem.putLongArray(32, longArr, 0, 8);\r\n    mem.putIntArray(0, intArr, 0, 8);\r\n\r\nThe ByteBuffer approach requires the creation of 3 additional objects and 3 changes to position!\r\nEach of the Memory calls are directly tied to a single Unsafe call, which is converted to CPU intrinsics by the JIT compiler.\r\n\r\nThe Memory package also allows wrapping a ByteBuffer for backward compatibility:\r\n\r\n    Memory mem = new NativeMemory(byteBuffer);\r\n\r\nThis allows simultaneous views of a region in memory from the ByteBuffer or from Memory.\r\nFor those cases where the PLMFR concepts are really required or the historical data was inadvertently written Big-Endian, the user can choose the ByteBuffer view.  New applications could use Memory directly, thus provide for a gradual transition away from the Big-Endian assumptions as well as away from the ByteBuffer entirely.\r\n\r\nMemory enables creating memory regions and mapped files larger than 2 GB, and for the really critical performance cases, Memory allows direct access to the Unsafe class, all caveats hereby included :)\r\n\r\nUnsafe (and thus Memory) are intentionally only Native-Endian for performance reasons. \r\n\r\n***\r\nI do not consider the proposed DataInput / DataOutput and IndexInput / IndexOutput to be similar to Memory at all. Instead, the DataInput / DataOutput classes could wrap or include Memory objects and have access to a very rich (and fast) API for reading & writing all the primitive types and their corresponding arrays, access to large (> 2GB) off-heap memory and memory-mapped files, and dual views into ByteBuffers if required. \r\n\r\nAs @cheddar pointed out, the current assumption of Big-Endian would continue the performance pain going forward. Unfortunately, specifying a Byte-Order parameter for every primitive read/write call would be a performance killer.\r\n\r\nI would like to propose that we work together to find a solution for Druid going forward. I would be glad to help you understand the Memory package and how to efficiently use it, and if some extensions to the Memory package is really required, it is open for discussion!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/267219562/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/267235772","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/3716#issuecomment-267235772","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3716","id":267235772,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NzIzNTc3Mg==","user":{"login":"weijietong","id":728692,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyODY5Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/728692?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijietong","html_url":"https://github.com/weijietong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijietong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijietong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijietong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijietong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijietong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijietong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijietong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijietong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijietong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-15T04:25:50Z","updated_at":"2016-12-15T04:25:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@leerho thanks for your idea. I am not insisting on my propose. I want to point out that as you gave examples : \r\n```\r\nMemory mem = new NativeMemory(byteArr);\r\nmem.putDoubleArray(96, dblsArr, 0, 8);\r\nmem.putLongArray(32, longArr, 0, 8);\r\nmem.putIntArray(0, intArr, 0, 8);\r\n```\r\nit's hard to give out the values like `0 , 32 , 96` relative to current Druid codes, and I agree NativeMemory may save some cpu instructions through using `Unsafe` ,but I think `NativeMemory` is a specific storage implementation eg memory. so what about other storage implementations like hdfs ,which only operates byte stream oriented ,then `Unsafe` can not give any help.\r\n\r\nSo I want to point out that we are now defining a interface A ,then we implement that interface A ,and utilize some performance better techs like `mmap` ,`Unsafe` ,`native ByteBuffer`.\r\n\r\nI would also be pleasure to see that we find out a better solution to let Druid run on different storage platforms without too pain refactor works .
