You can use -Dskywalking.* to override any config in file as you wish.\n> When two application use the same agent folder, by default, your logs output into the same file. This is hard to read and understand, but these is a bug in this version(3.2.6) to override it. I already try to fix it, see #697.\n> So, that is why I just recommend use separated agent jars.
