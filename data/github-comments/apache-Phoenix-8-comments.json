You can add a no-op condition to the query such as \"1=1\" or \"2=2\" which changes the persistent cache key, and thus is a way to force cache invalidation. You can do it on a daily basis, eg. 20180731=20180731, and this can also be used to pre-warm caches for upcoming days as well.

There were two workarounds \r\n1. Patch requests-kerberos (was never merged requests-kerberos#115 )\r\n2. A new SPNEGO handler for Avatica that would override Jetty's default handler (CALCITE-1922)\r\n\r\nIt turned out that 2 Produced the desired effect that I abandoned the path of attempting to path requests-kerberos.  However in the current PR #344 on top of Phoenix 5 it appears that this strategy no longer works.

Had a quick glance over the PR. I had a few questions. So in the case a view is created on top of a salted base table, we explicitly filter out the salting column (first column) when resolving the columns for a view, right? Also, in case any ancestor of a view drops a column, that will be part of the excluded columns list and we filter out those columns as well, when resolving a view? What happens if a view diverges from the base table, the base table drops a column and then the diverged view re-adds this column?\r\n\r\nOverall, can you please add more comments to make it easier to understand the steps taken when handling excluded columns? I will go over the PR in detail and let you know some more feedback.
