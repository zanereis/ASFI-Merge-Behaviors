I ever thought we can use a checkLeadershipLock here but since all client request are handled in callbacks, the lock can protect little.\r\n\r\nIf you have an idea to fix one participant multiple threads race condition, please comment.\r\n\r\nThe race condition is:\r\n\r\nT0. In thread 0 (th0) p is going to getChildren\r\nT1. In thread 1 (th1) p gets reconnected and calls getChildren\r\nT2. Supposed the node has gone due to session expire, th0 cannot find ourPath and reset\r\nT3. th1 gets a children set without the new node th0 created, or even reach checkLeadership before th0 creates new node. Then th1 reset.\r\n\r\nThe problem here is that we create node, get children all asynchronously, so even we add a lock in checkLeadership the callback can overwrite status. Even we lock callbacks, the creation can be uncompleted. The root cause should be that we should no have two competing threads for one participant.\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nUPDATE 1 - I notice that background are running serially and the order is the same as request sending. Perhaps we can setup invariant based on this premise. This is the case of CURATOR-644. CURATOR-645 is about 2 participants.\r\n\r\nUPDATE 2 - It seems with the assumption CURATOR-644 should be fixed also. The race condition shown above last cannot happen because if th1 `getChildren` after th0 `create`, th1 can find the node exists; if th1 `getChildren` before th0 `create`, th0 will be the leader first and th1 will be the leader later. Although it causes once more leader switch, it converges eventually determinately.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/1182730213/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604793591","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/curator/issues/1160#issuecomment-2604793591","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/1160","id":2604793591,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQjg0c6bQf73","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-13T03:55:19Z","updated_at":"2025-01-21T13:50:55Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=tison\">tison</a>:</i>\n<p>UPDATE - I believe that patch should resolve this ticket now.

The <a href=\"https://github.com/telepresenceio/telepresence/issues/161\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">telepresenceio issue #161</a> might be related somehow (although, I don't understand the full magnitude of it to be fair) but it leaves curator still in a place where this specific case is not handled properly. I did some investigation into the issue on when exactly the address is set to <tt>null</tt> (more specifically, I looked into the Java8 implementation of <tt>InetAddress</tt> which seems to be the relevant piece of code in <span class=\"error\">&#91;curator:Compatibility:116&#93;</span>(<a href=\"https://github.com/apache/curator/blob/d65669b64f003326c98843b32b997e3ffab1e442/curator-client/src/main/java/org/apache/curator/utils/Compatibility.java#L116\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/curator/blob/d65669b64f003326c98843b32b997e3ffab1e442/curator-client/src/main/java/org/apache/curator/utils/Compatibility.java#L116</a>)).</p>\n\n<p>The relevant entry point is <tt>InetSocketAddress#getAddress()</tt> which will forward the call to the internally held <tt>InetSocketAddressHolder</tt> instance through its <tt>getAddress()</tt> method. This boils down to the question how the <tt>InetSocketAddressHolder</tt> is initialized to return <tt>null</tt> as an address. It turns out that this can only happen if the <tt>InetSocketAddress</tt> is initialized through <tt>InetSocketAddress#createUnresolved</tt>. This seems to be a valid use-case that needs to be properly covered by curator.

CURATOR-645 could be covered separately in my opinion. CURATOR-645 was identified in FLINK-27078 where we run almost no logic before revoking the leadership by calling `LeaderLatch#close`. That caused the current leader's `LeaderLatch` instance to trigger its child node deletion while other `LeaderLatch` instances were right within setting up the watcher for its child node's predecessor.\r\n\r\nHence, I see CURATOR-645 being not that tightly related with the reconnect issue covered in CURATOR-644. CURATOR-645 just needs to be resolved before CURATOR-644 can be resolved.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the changes are not that big in the end that we couldn't resolve both in the same PR.  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/1230339944/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/1230415910","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/curator/pull/433#issuecomment-1230415910","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/433","id":1230415910,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQjg0c5JVqgm","user":{"login":"snuyanzin","id":403174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzE3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/403174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/snuyanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/snuyanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snuyanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snuyanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snuyanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snuyanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snuyanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snuyanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snuyanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snuyanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snuyanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-29T14:47:17Z","updated_at":"2022-08-29T14:47:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"hi @tisonkun thanks for the response\r\n\r\nin fact there are 3 jira issues for the same situation CURATOR-597, CURATOR-538, CURATOR-649\r\nevery fails with NPE since the address was marked as unresolved and as a result it tries to host from address...\r\nbut at the same time for unresolved addresses address is `null`....
