, @HScarb , \r\n\r\nThanks for your review. \r\nBut IMO,  For code consistency, I recommend not changing this method `ThreadLocalIndex#incrementAndGet()`, because this method is used in many places.\r\nIn most scenarios, it judge whether the result returned is positive or negative after the call, as  shown below: \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8653312/169936803-9ed90df7-35ff-4b8e-8c3c-225c0cee838f.png)\r\n\r\nAnd if we changing this method(`ThreadLocalIndex#incrementAndGet()`), The variable `index` it returned may be a positive number(eg: `Integer.MAX_VALUE`).  when `Math.abs(++index)` is called, we still need to judge if this value is negative, just looks like in the screenshot.\r\n\r\nHi @panzhi33 , @RongtongJin  what's your

But IMO, For code consistency, I recommend not changing this method `ThreadLocalIndex#incrementAndGet()`, because this method is used in many places. In most scenarios, it judge whether the result returned is positive or negative after the call, as shown below:\r\n> \r\n> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8653312/169936803-9ed90df7-35ff-4b8e-8c3c-225c0cee838f.png)\r\n> \r\n> And if we changing this method(`ThreadLocalIndex#incrementAndGet()`), The variable `index` it returned may be a positive number(eg: `Integer.MAX_VALUE`). when `Math.abs(++index)` is called, we still need to judge if this value is negative, just looks like in the screenshot.\r\n> \r\n> Hi @panzhi33 , @RongtongJin what's your opinion?\r\n\r\nI think it is better to modify

to the current release order of rocketmq, the documents of four versions of ```4.6```, ```4.7```, ```4.8``` and ```4.9``` are sorted at this stage.\r\nThe official website homepage document is re-divided into five guide items: ```Quickstart``` , ```Configuration``` , ```Performance``` , ```Operations```, ``` Clients``` and ```API Docs```\r\nRefer to the initial version of kafka (0.7) [documentation](https://kafka.apache.org/07/documentation.html)\r\nGive an example of ```producer``` and ```consumer```, and update the histogram of throughput comparison according to the stress test results\r\n\r\nCurrently only refactoring documentation for ``` 4.9.3```\r\n\r\n- [ ] The client part is used to sort out the exmaples on the official website, such as sequence message examples, broadcast message examples, timing message examples, batch message examples, filter message examples, transaction message examples, etc. [show here](https://rocketmq.apache.org/docs/order-example/)\r\n- [ ] Design documentation reference [here](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/blob/master/docs/en/design.md)\r\n- [ ] Operation document reference [here](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/blob/master/docs/en/operation.md)\r\n- [ ] Create a new tab named Use case, and combine the practice case of [these](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/develop/example/src/main/java/org/apache/rocketmq/example) with the practice case of [Documentation](https://github.com.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/docs/en)\r\n- [ ] Supplement API Docs document Currently client is only configured as [Producer
