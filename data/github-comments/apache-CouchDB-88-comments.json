This mainly follows the way of `_dbs_info` while there is slight difference for `/_deleted_dbs?key` because the key in key/value pair for `_deleted_dbs` is not only `dbname`, but also includes `timestamp`.

So you'd have something like:\r\n> \r\n> ```erlang\r\n> chunkify_binary(Data) ->\r\n>     chunkify_data(Data, binary_chunk_size()).\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nI considered doing that first, but was concerned with the ~10µs cost for each chunk that gets written, rather than just once when the db is opened/created. Is the idea that most data won't get chunked at all, so we shouldn't penalize the normal use case for a more obscure one?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/613572879/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/613594360","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/2778#issuecomment-613594360","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/2778","id":613594360,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMzU5NDM2MA==","user":{"login":"jaydoane","id":51209,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMjA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51209?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaydoane","html_url":"https://github.com/jaydoane","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaydoane/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaydoane/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaydoane/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaydoane/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaydoane/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaydoane/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaydoane/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaydoane/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaydoane/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-14T18:06:01Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T18:06:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@davisp

We didn't end up needing to use the js_pod_alloc thing so I didn't investigate it too much other than to say it appears related to the new zone concept that's vaguely referenced in places.\r\n\r\nThe Realm vs. Compartment situation is correct. The definitions are that a Compartment is a security layer and may have 1 or more Realms. This split was made so that a browser can share a single compartment for all iFrame's for a given remote host without incurring the cost of wrapping all shared objects. When we create new global objects we properly set the `setNewCompartmentAndZone()` option so that we have separate compartments for each sandbox.\r\n\r\nThe `std::move` discussion was resolved once I realized that the API of JS_NewUCString was changed from accepting a `char16_t*` to a `JS::UniqueTwoByteChars`. The version we have in 60 is correct when we extract the pointer and then tell the `UniquePtr` to not destroy its resource on success. In 68 the use of `std::move` is appropriate since we're transferring ownership correct (and no reset() is required, I'll make a note of this on the PR).\r\n\r\nThe failing test case is a bit of an awkward spot. The change that's happened is that in 68 there is now something magical that is automatically converting broken surrogate pairs into their equivalent `\\uXXXX` escape codes. This happens before the UTF-8 encoding step somewhere and there does not appear to be any sort of configuration knob at least in the code path of converting strings. I've not been able to find references to when or how the change was made to see if we can sidestep it. I'm at a bit of a loss on how we might want to handle this change. The way I see it we can do one of a few things:\r\n\r\n1. Figure out how to make SpiderMonkey stop doing this\r\n2. Patch couch_query_servers and friends to return these as errors that map rows are discarded and/or reported to the client\r\n3. Patch jiffy to do `0xFFFD` character replacement on \"broken\" `\\uXXXX` escape sequences\r\n4. Patch jiffy to have an option to not decode `\\uXXXX` escape sequences and then do... something?\r\n5. Light it all on fire\r\n\r\nI'll keep poking at that test case as it appears to be the last major thing left.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/616772769/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/617062273","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/2797#issuecomment-617062273","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/2797","id":617062273,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxNzA2MjI3Mw==","user":{"login":"janl","id":11321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl","html_url":"https://github.com/janl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-21T09:22:46Z","updated_at":"2020-04-21T09:22:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"heya, great report, thanks!\r\n\r\nCan you share your couch.log on all connected notes for the commands above.

updated the PR to meck the view write function so we can assert  that the index is not actually updated. \r\n\r\nI had also noticed that sometimes when we return from `wait_for_job/4` https://github.com/apache/couchdb/blob/30fdef77571c67c945d70fb54c07157c4643f828/src/couch_views/src/couch_views_jobs.erl#L94 when we query, the job could still running since we check the ViewSeq and UpdateSeq only in the data then unsubscribe. https://github.com/apache/couchdb/blob/30fdef77571c67c945d70fb54c07157c4643f828/src/couch_views/src/couch_views_jobs.erl#L118. So I added a function to also ensure the job is finished. This is to make the test is more deterministic.\r\n\r\n@tonysun83 good question about how to trigger that retry line. I think it would have to be something like a job with the old (now deleted ddoc) was running when the client with the current (not-deleted) doc id started the query. Then the job with the deleted doc would crash with the `ddoc_deleted` error, the client with the current ddoc would get the error and then `retry`. On retry, it will re-add the job which, if it is in a `pending` or `finished` state now update it with the non-deleted design doc id.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/619504341/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/619986911","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/2826#issuecomment-619986911","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/2826","id":619986911,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxOTk4NjkxMQ==","user":{"login":"rnewson","id":47223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson","html_url":"https://github.com/rnewson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-27T13:30:11Z","updated_at":"2020-04-27T13:30:11Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Eric
