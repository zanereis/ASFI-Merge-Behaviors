It doesn't look like it does from the commit you linked, will the library support it in the foreseeable future?\r\n\r\nLooking at your code I think you probably mix certificate authentication with transport level encryption. The OPC-UA protocol can use certificates to secure communication channel as well as to authenticate user. While I know little about python, below lines look more like transport level security:\r\n```python\r\nserver.load_certificate(\"certificates/server_certificate.der\")\r\nserver.load_private_key(\"certificates/server_private_key.pem\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother point - python code snippet uses `ua.SecurityPolicyType.Basic256Sha256_SignAndEncrypt`. In Apache PLC4X ua client this value is split into two connection options `security-policy=Basic256Sha256` and `message-security=SIGN_ENCRYPT`.\r\n\r\nBoth 0.12 and 0.13-SNAPSHOT support SIGN_ENCRYPT and can work with certificates. The keystore you configure is client private key and certificate used to secure channel. This certificate can be used by server to accept or refuse connection.\r\n\r\nIf you will have a look on https://reference.opcfoundation.org/Core/Part4/v104/docs/7.37 you will find there are few options for tokenType (UserTokenType): Anonymous, Username, Certificate, IssuedToken. We support only first two, however this does not prevent you at all from using certificates to secure channel.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/2434611691/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/2434786585","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/plc4x/issues/1610#issuecomment-2434786585","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/1610","id":2434786585,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBtifa86RH-UZ","user":{"login":"oliviercoma","id":4144376,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNDQzNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4144376?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oliviercoma","html_url":"https://github.com/oliviercoma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oliviercoma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oliviercoma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oliviercoma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oliviercoma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oliviercoma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oliviercoma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oliviercoma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oliviercoma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oliviercoma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-24T09:38:36Z","updated_at":"2024-10-24T09:38:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"We're also impacted by this issue.\r\nI wanted to work on a fix, but the SerialChannel implementation seems really hacky without much information / comments and thus really difficult to work on:\r\n- Why close method from AbstractChannel.AbstractUnsafe is overriden and completely by-passed as it deals with the specific issue (variable closeInitiated)\r\n- Why unsafe() returns a new instance each time (a new instance is recreated at each read).

If you'd rather skip all updates until the next major or minor version, let me know by commenting `@dependabot ignore this major version` or `@dependabot ignore this minor version`. You can also ignore all major, minor, or patch releases for a dependency by adding an [`ignore` condition](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates#ignore) with the desired `update_types` to your config file.\n\nIf you change your mind, just re-open this PR and I'll resolve any conflicts on it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/2485593271/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":{"id":29110,"client_id":"Iv1.4f9a6346434f815e","slug":"dependabot","node_id":"MDM6QXBwMjkxMTA=","owner":{"login":"github","id":9919,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjk5MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github","html_url":"https://github.com/github","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"name":"Dependabot","description":"","external_url":"https://dependabot-api.githubapp.com","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/dependabot","created_at":"2019-04-16T22:34:25Z","updated_at":"2024-03-20T21:06:35Z","permissions":{"actions":"read","checks":"write","contents":"write","issues":"write","members":"read","metadata":"read","pull_requests":"write","statuses":"read","vulnerability_alerts":"read","workflows":"write"},"events":["check_suite","issues","issue_comment","label","pull_request","pull_request_review","pull_request_review_comment","repository"]}}]
