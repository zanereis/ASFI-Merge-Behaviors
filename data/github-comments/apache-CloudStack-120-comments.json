Keep in mind however that we only use Basic Networking Zones, so I did my best to keep the behaviour in other circumstances (barring obvious bugs) the same, but I can't test those either.\n\nRegarding @ustcweizhou 's comment; the only change I perceive there is that, analogous to what's in the CsGuestNetwork, the code seems to imply that the `router_guest_gateway` will be added as DNS server in the case the SysVM is either a VPC or a redundant router. \n\nAs I encountered a merge conflict while building this PR, I think this is a relatively new conditional which seems to mirror the one (incorrectly) in CsGuestNetwork (one depends on the `is_vpc()` or `is_redundant()`, the other depends on the availability of the `router_guest_gateway` key). \n\nIf this both is true, I propose to change the `has_dns()` method to incorporate this logic and merge the same decision in CsGuestNetwork with that. \n\nOn the tests side, the (re)added use_extdns and ipaliases functionality both seem to lack functional testing.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/219709644/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/219712536","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1547#issuecomment-219712536","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1547","id":219712536,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxOTcxMjUzNg==","user":{"login":"DaanHoogland","id":2486961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODY5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2486961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland","html_url":"https://github.com/DaanHoogland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-17T13:10:47Z","updated_at":"2016-05-17T13:10:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@The-Loeki maybe it makes sense to split the PR, especially on the part where there is discussion.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/219712536/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/219726178","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1436#issuecomment-219726178","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1436","id":219726178,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxOTcyNjE3OA==","user":{"login":"swill","id":13644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill","html_url":"https://github.com/swill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-17T13:59:57Z","updated_at":"2016-05-17T13:59:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@sanju1010 unfortunately I can not get this into 4.9 with the current bug in it.
