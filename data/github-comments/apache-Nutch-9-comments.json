one thing I noticed with OkHttp is that its [ConnectionPool](https://github.com/square/okhttp/blob/master/okhttp/src/main/java/okhttp3/ConnectionPool.java) (default maxIdle 5, with eviction after 5 mins)  struggles when used with many threads and different hostnames, which would typically be the case with Nutch (and StormCrawler). I have seen an average of 1.5s and up to 6s contention on the ConnectionPool, my guess is that [the cleanup method](https://github.com/square/okhttp/blob/master/okhttp/src/main/java/okhttp3/ConnectionPool.java#L199) and its synchronized block is the main culprit. It iterates on all the connections but removes only the one which has been idle for the longest.\r\n\r\nApart from that okHTTP is great: pretty robust and less arcane than Apache HTTPClient IMHO.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/comments/387728096/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/comments/387754653","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nutch/pull/328#issuecomment-387754653","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/328","id":387754653,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4Nzc1NDY1Mw==","user":{"login":"sebastian-nagel","id":1630582,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzA1ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1630582?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastian-nagel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-09T14:19:06Z","updated_at":"2018-05-09T14:19:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks, @jnioche - I'll plan a load test next week.

After merging the master there are some conflicts associated with changes made by [NUTCH-1480](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NUTCH-1480). I've tried to fix these issues in [here](https://github.com/r0ann3l/nutch/commits/NUTCH-1541). You can to pick them from there.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the options of this plugin should be migrated from the file nutch-site.xml to index-writers.xml as proposed by [NUTCH-1480](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NUTCH-1480) and perhaps the prefix \"indexer.csv.\" could be removed, because the index-writers.xml file avoids ambiguity across the index writers.\r\n\r\nAs a recommendation I believe the static attributes you're using should be moved to an interface, how we have been doing in other indexers. I can contribute if you are agree with me.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/comments/402545528/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/comments/402708320","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nutch/pull/294#issuecomment-402708320","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/294","id":402708320,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMjcwODMyMA==","user":{"login":"sebastian-nagel","id":1630582,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzA1ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1630582?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastian-nagel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-05T12:38:51Z","updated_at":"2018-07-05T12:38:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @r0ann3l, I'm happy if you could take over and make this plugin work with the new indexer plugin configuration.
