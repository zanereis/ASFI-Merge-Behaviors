thing is - adding a dependency is not free. It means that everyone who packages spark downstream needs to deal with a bunch of annoying stuff. For instance, this introduces a new way for us to get an unintentional version bump of slf4j in the Spark build. It also means that if users are upgrading sfl4j on their own, they might have an issue where scala-logging doesn't work against newer versions of slf4j. It means that OS packagers will have to create a new RPM/Debian package for scala-logging if one doesn't exist. Basically, my point is we should have a high bar for any dependency.\n\nIf we go with the default plan of \"add it if it provides nonzero benefit\" - that's way too low of a bar and would result in an unwieldy project.\n\nAnyways on this one, maybe the best answer is to just re-write the spark logging to use scala-logging. Seems like it would be very straightforward. From my end, the main concern is just consolidating it with the normal spark

This is great! For your question about `LabeledPoint`. Label is not part of the features. So I don't quite understand \n\n> It may get annoying once you deal with sparse data since you must add/subtract 1 to each feature index when training.\n\nIf you were talking about the LIBSVM format, it is because LIBSVM format's feature indices are 1-based, not because they put labels as the first column. It's okay to change `LabeledPoint` to a tuple in Scala, but it may make Java users a little unhappier and also hurt the readability of the code.

Good idea to move the forwarding setup out of there but in the process it seems that edd96307a10fe7e869bd39afb0cdbbc3a8f46c4d broke the forwarding again.\n\nAlso: I think it is confusing to set the log level to null (root level). Parquet hides most log statements behind `if (level >= WARN)` etc. and relies on the compiler to remove these for performance reasons. So we should just do the same as parquet.Log does and do `parquetLogger.setLevel(parquet.Log.LEVEL)` so we won't confuse users. Note that the actual level can be still set via Log4J (assuming it's not finer than that).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39701612/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39701613","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/343#issuecomment-39701613","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/343","id":39701613,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NzAxNjEz","user":{"login":"AmplabJenkins","id":4031291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzEyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4031291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/AmplabJenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-07T07:12:32Z","updated_at":"2014-04-07T07:12:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Merged build started. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39701613/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39701614","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/340#issuecomment-39701614","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/340","id":39701614,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NzAxNjE0","user":{"login":"AmplabJenkins","id":4031291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzEyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4031291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/AmplabJenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-07T07:12:32Z","updated_at":"2014-04-07T07:12:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Merged build started. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39701614/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
