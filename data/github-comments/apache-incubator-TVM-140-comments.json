I've gone back and forth a few times on this and have 2 issues with taking that approach.\r\n1) I don't know why this shouldn't be considered a legal schedule. If we prevent construction like this, I think it puts more difficulty on users to generate legal schedules.\r\n2) This stems from code that was intending to do a fast gemm tiling which looks like: smem tile load -> local tile load -> local compute -> gmem store. This with another change (I'm not liking that change, and am uncertain if there's a better way to do it) allowed me to make that situation work but I couldn't find another equivalent schedule that would work. \r\n\r\nHad one more thought. Instead of making this an error, why wouldn't we relax this case in the bounds inference? It makes life more manual in that instance as we may have to rebind the same thread to different axis many times, but at least it isn't an error.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/551229481/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/551230656","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4273#issuecomment-551230656","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4273","id":551230656,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MTIzMDY1Ng==","user":{"login":"yongwww","id":10205827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjA1ODI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10205827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongwww","html_url":"https://github.com/yongwww","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongwww/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongwww/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongwww/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongwww/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongwww/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongwww/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongwww/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongwww/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongwww/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-07T19:35:15Z","updated_at":"2019-11-07T19:35:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Have closed it, sent it out by mistake, will pr later once it is ready.

For the alternate implementation, they show up in artifacts (or disk). For current PR, the allocation happens internally in the conv operator.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/551344312/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/551349270","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4277#issuecomment-551349270","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4277","id":551349270,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MTM0OTI3MA==","user":{"login":"zhenhuaw-me","id":4936589,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MzY1ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4936589?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenhuaw-me","html_url":"https://github.com/zhenhuaw-me","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenhuaw-me/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenhuaw-me/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenhuaw-me/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenhuaw-me/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenhuaw-me/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenhuaw-me/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenhuaw-me/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenhuaw-me/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenhuaw-me/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-08T01:57:31Z","updated_at":"2019-11-08T01:57:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ha!

We use NHWC layout\r\n2. Currently, we use Tensorize.\r\n\r\nWe stuied QNNPACK, but QNNPACK can not be used by us directly, some concept in QNNPACK we can not simulate, for example, indirect buffer. So we write the kernel by ourselves.\r\n\r\nFor Depthwise Convolution\r\n1. We use NHWC layout\r\n2. We don't use Tensorize.\r\n\r\nYes. We use INT6 * INT16 + INT16 -> INT32 instruction (SMLAL), which is better than INT32*INT32 + INT32->INT32. The way we do is we will substract the input_zero_point / kernel_zero_point before computation, at there, we will cast the dtype from UINT8 -> INT16.\r\n\r\nFor Depthwise convolution, even though we don't use Tensorize, we still get the performance bettern than QNNPACK(in mobilenet V1 / mobilenetV2, only 2 layers slower than it, others we are faster than QNNPACK). Amazing result. I wanna list two keypoints:\r\n\r\n1. Avoid data pack. In im2col / spatial pack, we will do data pack on H / W, which is cost on depthwise convolution, you could compute it directly and just split C. i.e. like this:\r\n```\r\n    kvshape = (C // VC, M, KH, KW, VC)\r\n    oshape = (N, OH, OW, C)\r\n    dvshape = (N, OH, OW, C // VC, KH, KW, VC)\r\n```\r\n2. compute_at is very important in depthwise convoltion. `data_pad_inline` / `data_vec_inline` / `conv_inline` should be tunable, this is one important factor to beyond QNNPACK. \r\n\r\nCurrently, we have tested MobilenetV2 on rasp, we are 1.34X compared with QNNPACK. In our in-house model, we are beyond more compared with QNNPACK. We will present more in TVM meetup.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/551359926/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/551362798","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4277#issuecomment-551362798","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4277","id":551362798,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MTM2Mjc5OA==","user":{"login":"FrozenGene","id":7287321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyODczMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7287321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene","html_url":"https://github.com/FrozenGene","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-08T02:56:34Z","updated_at":"2019-11-08T02:56:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> @jackwish Yes, sharing code will be very helpful.

While we understand that the current PR achieves the purpose of supporting external library by a different kind of wrapping, it does brings additional code that has duplicated functionality with DSOModule.\r\n\r\nUnless there is a strong reason to do so, I think we should not introduce the new Extern runtime. Instead, let us document the DSOModule's calling convention clearly and rewrite compilers to generate functions that can be loaded by the DSO module. That is, instead of generating a function with the extern calling convention, generate a function that takes the following signature\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n// the original foo you intended to generate\r\nvoid foo_(float* a, int N, float* b, int M, float* c) {\r\n   bar(...);\r\n   foobar(...);\r\n}\r\n\r\n// DSOModule compatible c function that can be compiled by gcc.\r\nextern \"C\" int foo(TVMValue* value, int *type_code, int nargs) {\r\n   CHECK_EQ(nargs, 2);\r\n   DLTensor* arg0 = static_cast<DLTensor*>(value.v_handle);\r\n   DLTensor* arg1 = static_cast<DLTensor*>(value.v_handle);\r\n\r\n   foo_(static_cast<float*>(args0->data), args0->shape[0],\r\n           static_cast<float*>(args1->data), args1->shape[0]));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can just return the above code as a CSourceModule, compile it with gcc and link with to the other generated code. In this way, the generated code can enjoy all the benefits of our existing infra, pass through RPC and combined with other libs.\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\n\r\nThe main rationale behind the suggestion is that we want to avoid code specializations and reduce future technical debts.  As we can see the current PR introduces special changes to several locations to support the new mode. Which increases the cost of maintaining the separate loading mechanism.\r\n\r\nIn short: the best design is not achieved when there is nothing to add, but when there is nothing to take away \r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/551957000/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/551960356","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4280#issuecomment-551960356","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4280","id":551960356,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MTk2MDM1Ng==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-08T19:30:44Z","updated_at":"2019-11-08T19:31:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"As a followup thread about what we might be able to benefit from in terms of external module, it would be great if we have another function that generates something like a graph spec, which can be interpreted and calls into the library functions(just a bit like our graph runtime).

The reason (that I also got to know very recently while trying to use AutoTVM) is the tight relationship between AutoTVM and AlterOpLayout. In AutoTVM, we need to first extract the right kernels to tune (so we need to run AlterOpLayout to ensure that we have right layouts). And then after tuning is finished, we want to apply those tuned config. This again now needs to go through AlterOpLayout where we set up the config this time while also changing the layouts.\r\n\r\n\r\nLegalize and AlterOpLayout might seem very similar to each other, but they are somewhat different. Legalize is more like a local optimization where when we see a Relay operator, we can replace it with a sequence of another Relay operators. The link that you pasted for Legalize in ARM CPU was basically inserting layout transforms before and after each conv. AlterOpLayout, on the other hand, is somewhat of a global optimization, where the layouts are basically propagated as deep as possible before inserting the layout transform. Therefore, in this CR, I am removing the legalize and moving towards the AlterOpLayout. Once we insert the layout transform for first conv, it propagates the layout to next operator (preventing an insertion of layout transform if possible) and so on.\r\n\r\nOne way to reduce all this complexity is to write another pass that basically converts the whole graph from NHWC to NCHW (irrespective of target). One can call this pass before calling relay.build. In current scenario, where ARM only supports NCHW, that pass will be extremely useful. And then the AlterOpLayout remains unchanged. However, that pass is not yet finalized, and might take some time - https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/layout-conversion-pass/4009\r\n\r\nIn current implementation, I don't know of any better way to solve the problem. @yzhliu @kevinthesun  Please let us know what you think.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/552168343/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/552169896","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4277#issuecomment-552169896","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4277","id":552169896,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MjE2OTg5Ng==","user":{"login":"anijain2305","id":13822661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODIyNjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13822661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305","html_url":"https://github.com/anijain2305","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-10T07:19:24Z","updated_at":"2019-11-10T07:19:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jackwish Thanks for the comment.\r\n\r\nIf we go legalize way, following kind of transformation would happen\r\n\r\n\r\n~~~\r\nOriginal Relay graph --> conv2d(%int8_data, %int8_kernel)\r\n\r\nAfterLegalize Relay graph --> \r\n\r\n%int16_data = cast(%int8_data, dtype=\"int16\")\r\n%int16_kernel = cast(%int8_kernel, dtype=\"int16\")\r\nconv2d(%int16_data, %int16_kernel)\r\n~~~\r\nSo, in this case, even if we want to use tensorize, we will only see int16 inputs in conv.
