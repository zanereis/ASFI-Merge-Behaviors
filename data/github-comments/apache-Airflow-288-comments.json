Instead of sending `[\"airflow\", \"tasks\", \"run\", ...]` it would be nice to send `{'dag_id': dag_id, 'task_id': task_id, ... }`\r\n\r\nAs an aside, while considering options for an asyncio executor, there could be various ways that the task \"type\" (data/spec/payload - you name it) needs to be parsed by some kind of asyncio coroutine that can spawn and manage 1000's of coroutines on an event loop, such that each of those task coroutines can `await` any awaitable to yield control back to the event loop.  In a way, this idea might be similar to whatever is managing the messages in this PR.  I'd like to understand any changes to task designs.  I've kinda bumped into this while trying to do a small POC on the dask executor, i.e. #6984 \r\n\r\nI like the idea of a persistent message queue for tasks:\r\n- an option for using Kafka might help for users who need massive scale with fault tolerance\r\n- redis with persistence options could be useful too","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/570740844/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/570741250","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6985#issuecomment-570741250","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6985","id":570741250,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MDc0MTI1MA==","user":{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-04T00:52:27Z","updated_at":"2020-01-04T00:52:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Something is wrong with this change.

This is against the idea of short and long options in Unix (and argparse follows that). The main reason to have short options is that you can combine short options:\r\n\r\n`airflow task run -iAlm` \r\n\r\nWhen you have more than one letter \"short\" options this might become quickly ambiguous. We do not have -s yet but if we add few more options this might become a problem.\r\n\r\nAlso in the argparse documentation https://docs.python.org/2/library/argparse.html it's mentioned that short options should be single character only.\r\n\r\nDoes it bother others?

that?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/570891939/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/570892322","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/7057#issuecomment-570892322","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/7057","id":570892322,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MDg5MjMyMg==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-05T09:20:29Z","updated_at":"2020-01-05T09:20:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Needs

eventually hangs the whole build. \r\nThis seems to be connected to lack of enough resources on travis builds sometimes (we think they are running on shared machines and maybe those run sometimes too

Thanks for pointing out. I agree with @tooptoop4 that his change is only meant for DAGs with `schedule_interval` equal to None, i.e. those that are triggered externally using the CLI or other means. The ones scheduled by Airflow should not be affected.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/570979008/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/571005760","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6881#issuecomment-571005760","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6881","id":571005760,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MTAwNTc2MA==","user":{"login":"zhongjiajie","id":15820530,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODIwNTMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15820530?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie","html_url":"https://github.com/zhongjiajie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-06T05:09:26Z","updated_at":"2020-01-06T05:09:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"We still have discuss in https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6881#issuecomment-570850316, It's will be great if @potiuk @mik-laj to share your idea.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/571005760/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/571032638","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6881#issuecomment-571032638","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6881","id":571032638,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MTAzMjYzOA==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-06T07:19:50Z","updated_at":"2020-01-06T07:19:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@zhongjiajie : I think it will be best if sort according to long option only (especially if we fix the short options to be one-letter). General idea behind long options is that people - when learning CLI tend to use longer options and they are preferred in automation/scripts. They are easier to memorize and they carry the meaning. Also when using autocomplete, it is much easier to learn as you start using longer option prefix and it gets auto-completed.\r\n\r\nThe short (one letter) options are for \"expert mode\" only and they are pretty much just a shorthand if you get familiar with the CLI and want to use it quickly / have no autocomplete and you are very familiar with the tool itself.\r\n\r\nThat's why i prefer to sort only on long options.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/571032638/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/571033170","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6881#issuecomment-571033170","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6881","id":571033170,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MTAzMzE3MA==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-06T07:22:04Z","updated_at":"2020-01-06T07:22:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"BTW.
