Perhaps I should add the following as comments? \r\n\r\nThis renderer actually handles two classes: UISelectBoolean and UISelectMany. We are merely trying to fix UISelectBoolean in this patch, and not UISelectMany at this time to try to keep merge requests small and focused. \r\n\r\nThe single checkbox INPUT_ELEM for UISelectBoolean is opened in `encodeBegin()`, and closed in the `encodeEnd()`. \r\n\r\nThe INPUT_ELEM for UISelectMany is left alone in `encodeEnd()`. In `renderCheckboxList()` for UISelectMany, it calls the single checkbox renderer `renderCheckbox()`. The additional branch to check for an instanceof UISelectMany leaves the the current behavior for writing the end element unchanged for this class. \r\n\r\nWe can make changes to handle both classes in this patch, but we'd prefer to handle in a separate PR. \r\n\r\nWe have tested this manually and it is passing the unit tests written in `HtmlCheckboxRendererTest`. \r\n\r\nHopefully this clears things up.
