It appears the library allows the option to specify the dimensions for dataset.source.  When not explicitly specified, it makes a best-effort to detect dimensions on its own.  In the minimum example, it uses the first data point, which unfortunately happens to be the one missing GSWY dimension.  It would be inefficient for the library to scan all the data points in order to auto-detect all potential dimensions when it can be provided beforehand. It seems reasonable to first check the data and dimensions beforehand.  If not possible, there are a couple options. \r\n\r\n1) In the minimal example, reverse the order of dataset.source so the first data point contains all the dimensions.  For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    \"dataset\": {\r\n        \"source\": [\r\n            {\r\n                \"timestamp\": 1568191140000,\r\n                \"ECM\": 1666775.3333333333,\r\n                \"GSWY\": 1332.5333333333333,\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                \"timestamp\": 1568191020000,\r\n                \"ECM\": 26311.466666666667,\r\n            },\r\n        ]\r\n```\r\n2) If not, try explicitly specifying all dimensions in option.series\r\n\r\n```\r\n    \"series\": [{\r\n            \"type\": \"bar\",\r\n            \"name\": \"ECM\",\r\n            \"dimensions\": ['timestamp','ECM','GSWY'],\r\n            \"encode\": {\r\n                \"x\": \"timestamp\",\r\n                \"y\": \"ECM\"\r\n            },\r\n            \"stack\": \"one\",\r\n            \"itemStyle\": {\r\n                \"normal\": {\r\n                    \"color\": \"#2ec7c9\"\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"type\": \"bar\",\r\n            \"name\": \"GSWY\",\r\n            \"dimensions\": ['timestamp','ECM','GSWY'],\r\n            \"encode\": {\r\n                \"x\": \"timestamp\",\r\n                \"y\": \"GSWY\"\r\n            },\r\n            \"stack\": \"one\",\r\n            \"itemStyle\": {\r\n                \"normal\": {\r\n                    \"color\": \"#97b552\"\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    ],\r\n```\r\n\r\nHope this helps.

is not a bug. `left` means the distance between the left boundary of the element to the left boundary of the echarts.\r\n\r\nThere is a workaround for this issue:\r\n\r\n```js\r\noption = {\r\n    graphic: [\r\n        {\r\n            type: 'group',\r\n            left: '35%',\r\n            top: 'center',\r\n            bounding: 'raw', // Notice that this prop is necessary.\r\n            children: [{\r\n                type: 'text',\r\n                style: {\r\n                    text: 'ASDFASDF',\r\n                    fontSize: 50,\r\n                    textVerticalAlign: 'middle',\r\n                    textAlign: 'center'\r\n                }\r\n            }]\r\n        }\r\n    ],\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut indeed it is not easy to know the workaround of locating an element aligning with a component located via `center` (like `pie`, `polar`, `sunburst`).\r\nPerhaps we might provide some new approaches to locate. For example, provide an `center` prop:\r\n```js\r\ngraphic: [{\r\n      type: 'text',\r\n      center: ['35%', null], // null means only set x center but leave y center not set\r\n      style: {\r\n          text: 'asdfasdfasd'\r\n      } \r\n}]\r\n``` \r\nBut this idea seams not good enough.\r\n\r\nOr another option is just do nothing but use the workaround above to handle this kind of scenario.\r\nThat is, make the tutorial of \"custom layout by `group`\" in doc.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/568558396/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/568624687","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/4856#issuecomment-568624687","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/4856","id":568624687,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2ODYyNDY4Nw==","user":{"login":"Lykeios","id":32020504,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDIwNTA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32020504?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lykeios","html_url":"https://github.com/Lykeios","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lykeios/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lykeios/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lykeios/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lykeios/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lykeios/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lykeios/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lykeios/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lykeios/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lykeios/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-24T01:53:37Z","updated_at":"2019-12-24T01:53:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"关心进度","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/568624687/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/568632298","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/3976#issuecomment-568632298","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/3976","id":568632298,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2ODYzMjI5OA==","user":{"login":"mstcyj","id":22636303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjM2MzAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22636303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstcyj","html_url":"https://github.com/mstcyj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstcyj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstcyj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstcyj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstcyj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstcyj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstcyj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstcyj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstcyj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstcyj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-24T02:37:46Z","updated_at":"2019-12-24T02:37:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"我也是用chart.clear()
