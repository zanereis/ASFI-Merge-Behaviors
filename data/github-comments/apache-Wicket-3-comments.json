So the first step is run `$ ./run.sh`. \n\nThe next step is that there should be one index.adoc file which include all the other adoc files. Gdoc has toc.yml but asciidoc need a completely other syntax. `toctoindex.php` loads guide/toc.yml and give an output that should be index.adoc. To do that, run `$ ./toctoindex.php > asciidoc/index.adoc`.\n\nIf that's done, run `$ mvn` in `wicket-user-guide` to render index.adoc to index.html and index.pdf with all adoc files included. In `wicket-user-guide/target/generated-docs` is the result. Ignore the empty directories.\n\nI hope this will help.

This is a very deep manipulation of Wicket, we are fully aware of that, but it was essential for our high traffic scenario.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/132177334/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/132194422","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/wicket/pull/136#issuecomment-132194422","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/136","id":132194422,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMjE5NDQyMg==","user":{"login":"martin-g","id":232002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjAwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/232002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g","html_url":"https://github.com/martin-g","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-18T12:39:45Z","updated_at":"2015-08-18T12:39:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Please
