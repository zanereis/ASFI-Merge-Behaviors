Just to be clear: It's ok in my opinion to first concentrate only on the maven build. I just wanted to ask so we're sure what's included here and what is not. It would be great in that case if you could create a follow-up issue in Jira where you note what's still TODO after TINKERPOP-2749 is done.\r\n\r\nThe .NET code builds successfully as well, but there is an issue where intermediate GitHub actions runs fail for the windows build (~1-2 out of 10). This issue needs to be more thoroughly investigated so for now I haven't added the Windows build in the GHA jobs. My apologies, I should've explained why I didn't add it in. I have updated the PR description to include this detail.\r\n\r\nOfcourse! I will create a follow-up issue detailing all the rest of the work for this issue in JIRA.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1151660193/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1151665966","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1677#issuecomment-1151665966","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1677","id":1151665966,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc5EpQcu","user":{"login":"lyndonbauto","id":58273576,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MjczNTc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58273576?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto","html_url":"https://github.com/lyndonbauto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-09T22:02:56Z","updated_at":"2022-06-09T22:02:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"VOTE+1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1151665966/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1151745842","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1694#issuecomment-1151745842","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1694","id":1151745842,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc5Epj8y","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-10T00:28:35Z","updated_at":"2022-06-10T00:28:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1694?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) Report\n> Merging [#1694](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1694?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (78d9fa5) into [3.5-dev](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/tinkerpop/commit/f26bb10985f72d283ba85c0b23fce6e6518d931a?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (f26bb10) will **not change** coverage.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n```diff\n@@           Coverage Diff            @@\n##           3.5-dev    #1694   +/-   ##\n========================================\n  Coverage    63.35%   63.35%           \n========================================\n  Files           23       23           \n  Lines         3553     3553           \n========================================\n  Hits          2251     2251           \n  Misses        1129     1129           \n  Partials       173      173           \n```\n\n\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1694?src=pr&el=continue&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation).\n> **Legend** -

This looks mostly like a copy/paste of the existing `ShortestPathVertexProgram` with some minor change to `collectShortestPaths()`. is that the only change? If it is, is then I think you'd want to rethink how this is implemented so that you could offer this new functionality and make better re-use of existing code.\r\n2. For an \"algorithm\" I wouldn't typically be in favor of accepting a PR with just the `VertexProgram` implementation. We would want it accessible from Gremlin as we do with other algorithms which could mean a Gremlin language change (maybe?) which would in turn require some discussion.

gremlin-server as a replacement for AWS Neptune locally and on CI. Main use case - create tens of thousands of vertices and nodes(in parallel from multiple processes), run some queries, drop all the data with `g.V().drop()`. The error occurs even if I delete edges with `g.E().drop()` first.\r\n\r\nThe script that imports the data heavily relies on [the upsert pattern](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49758417/cosmosdb-graph-upsert-query-pattern), multiple processes may try to upsert same vertices and edges in parallel.\r\n\r\nAfter the first error, I'm able to drop all vertices one by one except the one which probably caused the error. Attempts to drop it lead to the same error. That vertex was created with an upsert.  Server has to be restarted to act normally.\r\n\r\nFrom my experience the error occurs more often if I use more parallel processes to import my data.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1154054781/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1154087445","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1699#issuecomment-1154087445","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1699","id":1154087445,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc5EyfoV","user":{"login":"javeme","id":9625821,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MjU4MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9625821?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javeme","html_url":"https://github.com/javeme","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javeme/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javeme/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javeme/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javeme/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javeme/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javeme/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javeme/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javeme/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javeme/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-13T15:47:00Z","updated_at":"2022-06-13T15:47:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The

I'd recommend that if you use Gremlin Server for testing that you switch from TinkerGraph to something more robust like neo4j, bitsy, janusgraph, etc. - i.e. a graph more suited to handling multi-threading.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1157569322/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1157585246","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1700#issuecomment-1157585246","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1700","id":1157585246,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc5E_1le","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-16T12:07:56Z","updated_at":"2022-06-16T12:07:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> It extracts the whitelisted set of per-request options in makeBytecodeRequests() and adds them to the bytecode request without modifying the generated bytecode.\r\n\r\nI don't think that's a bad approach and I can't think of any problems with this offhand.
