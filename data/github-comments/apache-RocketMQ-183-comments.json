In the test environment, due to different project branches, it may be further subdivided into testA, testB, testC and other sub-environments. Based on the actual needs, we can choose to create a separate topic/group with the “environment” logo for a specific environment, so as to realize multi-environment MQ message isolation, which is more common in practice.\r\nHowever, when we do a gray-scale release for a certain environment (e.g., prod environment), if we create additional shadow topics/groups for the purpose of gray-scale functionality, this may cause some problems. First, the criticality issue: when the grayscale validation passes and switches to the prod environment (e.g., the pod of the grayscale service is taken offline normally), the grayscale messages may be consumed underconsumed, which is unacceptable. Second, the cost issue: doubling each topic and group in order to implement the grayscale functionality brings significant cost overhead.\r\nFor multiple environments, complete isolation by adding new topics/groups, combined with the ability to partition grayscale during grayscale in specific environments (e.g., online environments) are not conflicting and are complementary.\r\n2, the gray-scale partitioning used in this program is, more often than not, by not adding a new topic/group, quasi-environment-specific (eg: prod environment) for gray-scale release, you can make MQ low-cost, convenient way to also have the ability to gray-scale. (ps: full-link grayscale scenario, http, gRPC and other interface calls can be gray-scale traffic forwarding, mq also need to have ...)\r\nThis design ensures that each environment can perform grayscale publishing in an orderly and independent manner.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/2290953556/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/2290956123","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/8462#issuecomment-2290956123","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/8462","id":2290956123,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl86IjTdb","user":{"login":"hxnan","id":5309375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMDkzNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5309375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hxnan","html_url":"https://github.com/hxnan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hxnan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hxnan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hxnan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hxnan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hxnan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hxnan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hxnan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hxnan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hxnan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-15T09:22:10Z","updated_at":"2024-08-15T09:22:10Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@RongtongJin  希望能发布包含这两个patch的 4.x的正式补丁版本。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/2290956123/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/2291027297","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/8508#issuecomment-2291027297","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/8508","id":2291027297,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl86Ijk1h","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-15T10:19:34Z","updated_at":"2024-08-16T02:24:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## [Codecov](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/rocketmq/pull/8508?dropdown=coverage&src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=apache) Report\nAll modified and coverable lines are covered by tests :white_check_mark:\n> Project coverage is 47.00%.

The PR requires that the \"gray consumer\" be started before the \"gray producer.\" If the gray consumer fails to start, it can lead to \"gray messages\" being sent to the base environment, may causing issues. In other words, the PR assumes that consumers in the base environment have the capability to consume gray messages, but this cannot be guaranteed.\r\n> 2. The plan does not account for scenarios where subscription are different. When gray consumers with different subscription and base consumers are running concurrently, how can we ensure that if client crashes or other exceptions, consumer offset is not skipped?\r\n> 3. The remoting protocol client  can be rewrite load balancing rules and select message queue function by users ; it is not a difficult task. Thus, the question arises whether it is necessary to merge this PR.\r\n> 4.

Even without the grayscale partitioning scheme, the same problem is faced when a grayscale consumer (grayscale pods) has a different subscription relationship than a normal consumer (normal pods). Solving the MQ subscription inconsistency problem requires another PR to deal with, and the commit scheme can be further explored if there is time, so we won't expand on it here.\r\n\r\nGray-to-normal bridging issue:\r\nWhen the grayscale validation passes, it triggers the normal downtime of the grayscale service and triggers the rebalancing logic. By way of admin tools, I have not tried this. Either way, it's essentially modifying the client's grayTag, clientId, and other related configurations so that all consumer instances under the same consumer group can sense each other's grayscale status.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/2292942981/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/2293622098","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/8469#issuecomment-2293622098","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/8469","id":2293622098,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl86IteVS","user":{"login":"syhleo","id":26354748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MzU0NzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26354748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/syhleo","html_url":"https://github.com/syhleo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syhleo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syhleo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syhleo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syhleo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syhleo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syhleo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syhleo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syhleo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syhleo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-16T14:32:21Z","updated_at":"2024-08-16T14:32:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you very much for all the great replies.
