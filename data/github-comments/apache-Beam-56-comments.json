a mess. Thanks for tackling this, and for linking to relevant context. If I understand correctly: \n1. `package-info.java` files generate spurious rebuilds because they don't by default generate a `.class` file which can be used to track necessary rebuild.\n2. Adding a package annotation in the file causes it to generate a `.class` file.\n3. The only standard annotation in JDK 1.5 is `@Deprecated`, so instead this defines a `@Package` annotation.\n\nDid I grok that correctly? Makes sense to me. \n\n[One comment](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MCOMPILER-205?focusedCommentId=14428953&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-14428953) recommends `<exclude>`'ing the problematic files from incremental analysis. Have you tried that? This would presumably only be a problem if you made local changes to a `package-info.java` file which were important for rebuild. Since ours are all boilerplate, this shouldn't be an issue.\n\nre: Is this ok for `build-tools`: I imagine `build-tools` for build resources rather than code dependencies, but that doesn't need be the case. This `@Package` annotation is specifically for influencing the build process, so in that context `build-tools` is the right place.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/256709956/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/256709975","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/1205#issuecomment-256709975","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/1205","id":256709975,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NjcwOTk3NQ==","user":{"login":"lukecwik","id":10078956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc4OTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10078956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik","html_url":"https://github.com/lukecwik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-27T17:14:50Z","updated_at":"2016-10-27T17:14:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Isn't this a problem for all java modules and not just sdks/java/core?\n\nThe reason why I don't like this annotation based approach is that it requires all package info files to contain it to prevent this problem and is to workaround a limitation in the maven compiler plugin.

With the one missing piece that `-Xpkginfo:always` was added in Java 7 to have `javac` create the class files even if they have no content, but in fact this _always_ throws a NPE in all Java 7 JDKs we use :-). I previously proposed a PR with `<exclude>` but @davorbonaci didn't like that. I do think that changes to the javadoc might get missed? Surely a release build always starts with a `mvn clean` but just to be safe, I do agree with him that it is nice to not exclude them. I'm happy either way.\n\n@lukecwik it could be, but the SDK is the one that I noticed having the rebuilds, while other modules did not (it has been a while since I bothered watching builds vs going and having a coffee - maybe this will get us closer to interactive speed). I didn't look into the status of other modules. I know our javadoc and/or checkstyle config now insists on having them.

I spent a few hours on this, plus @davorbonaci helped :).\n\nA few summaries:\n\n### Regression: not threadsafe as proposed\n\nThe current PR's lazy getters are not threadsafe. Making them threadsafe requires some work, see link below.\n- I am generally unhappy with putting any synchronized code on the encode()/decode() paths, because those are performance-critical. However, we hope is that a single volatile check will not be too bad.\n- So if the perf impact is fairly negligible, well, it's probably fine to go ahead. If there is large perf impact, I'd vote for just registering Kryo to use Java serialization for this class. (And, if necessary, rewriting the serialization code in a better way to not need to expose the inner proxy class.)\n  (The AvroCoder serialization was already convoluted crap, this is new crap, no change in amount of crap. ;).\n\nYou can assess the performance impact using the Avro microbenchmark:  https://github.com/apache/incubator-beam/blob/master/sdks/java/microbenchmarks/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/microbenchmarks/coders/AvroCoderBenchmark.java\n\nLink: http://jeremymanson.blogspot.com/2008/05/double-checked-locking.html\n\n### Does threadsafe matter?\n\nSuppose the `volatile` variable access on the hotpath affects perf significantly. Do we care if we just use double-checked locking with no threadsafety?\n\nMaybe not. So we create the ThreadLocals a bunch of times, if the instance is short-lived this may not matter much, and if the coder instance is long lived then eventually it will go across enough synchronization barriers that one will win. We will use extra memory, but since nothing is static we should eventually recover.\n\n-Dan\n\ncc: @lukecwik thoughts?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/256798085/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/256798325","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/1210#issuecomment-256798325","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/1210","id":256798325,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1Njc5ODMyNQ==","user":{"login":"dhalperi","id":526415,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNjQxNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/526415?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi","html_url":"https://github.com/dhalperi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-27T23:28:29Z","updated_at":"2016-10-27T23:28:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM, merging.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/256798325/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/256802048","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/1199#issuecomment-256802048","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/1199","id":256802048,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NjgwMjA0OA==","user":{"login":"dhalperi","id":526415,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNjQxNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/526415?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi","html_url":"https://github.com/dhalperi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-27T23:53:07Z","updated_at":"2016-10-27T23:53:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Awesome, thanks.

Essentially, what you call is `getInternalTimerService(String, TypeSerializer<N>)` which will get you an `InternalTimerService` for the given name/ID and that can store additional data (namespace) of type `N`. On this service you can register/delete processing-time and event-time timers. You can have several timers for each ID and deletion always requires giving the timestamp and namespace. \n\nSo this is different from your changes where there is always only one timer per ID, setting a new timer deletes the old timer and deleting a timer doesn't require the exact timestamp/namespace, just the ID. To the user, we don't expose the ability to delete timers, right now, because it is a potentially costly operation that we might in the feature want to also get rid of internally. \n\nI think the updated interface of this PR can be used with the Flink timer service but it will require keeping additional state to allow deletion by ID. (I think, for now, not 100% sure.)
