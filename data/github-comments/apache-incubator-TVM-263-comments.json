I missed renaming \"gpu\" to \"cuda\" in the command line flag in PR #8032. I prefer  using \"cuda\" as the device type because it is more consistent with other parts of the tvm code, for example, we are using `tvm.cuda()` now.

I have kept an alternative implementation of these:\r\n- TVMBackendAllocWorkspace (not used, under ifdef)\r\n- TVMBackendFreeWorkspace (not used, under ifdef)\r\n- TVMAPISetLastError (cannot use from c_runtime_api.c until next PR implemented)\r\n- TVMGetLastError (cannot use from c_runtime_api.c until next PR implemented)\r\nI will remove them at outcome of the next PR that will clean the c_backend_api.c. For now, prefer to keep these functions here.\r\n\r\n> my comments here are around how the Python emitter is written--it would be great to ensure the style is in line with the rest of the codebase since it is going into 'python/tvm'.\r\n\r\nAligned the code along with your comments. The only thing I'd like to keep are my headers of type:\r\n```\r\n# ==========================================================\r\n#   get_input_tensor_name\r\n# ==========================================================\r\n```\r\nI have moved any doc description from them into the python doc strings. However, I have a couple of scripts that rely on finding these headers. If removing them is not an absolute MUST, perhaps I can keep it. Let me know.\r\n\r\n> we need to avoid repo bloat by not adding large test data (this model is MBs). can you download this from somewhere? see download_testdata in python/tvm/contrib/download.py.\r\n\r\nFixed that.\r\n\r\n> thinking again about the SDK - TVM split, I see a bunch of stuff here that I think makes sense in TVM, e.g. 'struct ai_network_report'_ and dependencies. then I see some other stuff e.g. this ICC-specific logic here. It seems pretty hard to test this--wondering if it's necessary to place all of this in 'ai_platform.h'?\r\n\r\nI need to verify and will get back on this point quickly.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/853790415/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/853854095","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8023#issuecomment-853854095","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8023","id":853854095,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg1Mzg1NDA5NQ==","user":{"login":"Mousius","id":4933431,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MzM0MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4933431?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius","html_url":"https://github.com/Mousius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-03T13:06:39Z","updated_at":"2021-06-03T13:06:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@areusch

I slightly prefer`fake_quantization_to_integer` because it's a bit more concise. \r\n\r\nAlso, I did a quick google search and I think that the term affine space is used when talking about quantization in physics, but I didn't see any references to it in computer science literature. The only thing that comes up if you search \"affine space\" is stuff about vector spaces, and if you search \"quantization affine space\" you get physics papers. \r\n\r\nSo I think if we do use the term affine space, we should be careful to explain what we mean by it in code comments and documentation since it's not a term that is commonly used.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/854120045/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/854134852","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8126#issuecomment-854134852","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8126","id":854134852,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg1NDEzNDg1Mg==","user":{"login":"mbrookhart","id":4065489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNjU0ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4065489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart","html_url":"https://github.com/mbrookhart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-03T19:51:43Z","updated_at":"2021-06-03T19:51:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm

Note that our TVM-native sorting performance is quite good thanks to https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7611, and it works equally well on dynamic inputs, so thrust is no longer a requirement for good performance. Also the new implementation does not call `get_valid_count`, which uses thrust for exclusive scan on relatively large input (total number of boxes, which in our case num_boxes * num_class).\r\n\r\nI see that the number of boxes is quite small in your model, I believe the new implementation would be much faster when the number of boxes is large. Do you have other models, preferably the one with more input boxes?\r\n\r\nI've been testing tf2 models from https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf2_detection_zoo.md, their ssd mv2 model (FPNLite 320x320) has 12480 boxes,  and ssd resnet 50 v1 has more than 50000,

Since batched sort with thrust is implemented via two calls to stable sort, when the axis to sort is small the overhead from the two calls become relatively big. And for small sort, TVM's sort should be faster than Thrust.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, the previous implementation does sort on `(batch, num_boxes * class)` along the second axis, so Thrust sort is fast.
