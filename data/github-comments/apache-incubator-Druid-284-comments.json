interesting analysis.\r\n\r\n> This means that creating concurrent and non-concurrent groupers should be un-generalized (currently generalized in `RowBasedGrouperHelper.createGrouperAccumulatorPair()` method), but this seems to be beneficial because this looks like a false abstraction which only adds coupling and confusion of execution paths (harder to see which grouper type is created and used when) rather than lifts any logic. For that matter, `ConcurrentGrouper` doesn't need to implement `Grouper` interface, too, providing _only_ `aggregate(int threadNumber, key)` method, but not standard `Grouper`'s methods `aggregate(key)` and `aggregate(key, keyHash)`. I think it would also make things clearer because it would become more evident for people who try to unwind the logic of the subsystem in their heads where `ConcurrentGrouper` could and could not appear.\r\n\r\nI also think splitting ConcurrentGrouper out of the Grouper interface would make things clearer. Or maybe redesigning the Grouper interface somehow. The various implementations have a lot of similarities, but I think the attempt to unify everything into a single interface was not done well.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how I feel about the specific idea of introducing a thread number in the concurrent version. It seems error-prone, but may perform better enough than the instance-level threadlocals that it could be worth it.\r\n\r\nBy the way, the vectorized version is already split out (see VectorGrouper).\r\n\r\n> Also, it means that `concurrencyHint` is not actually a \"hint\", that is, something completely heuristical/performance-related which could be any number, but actually a parameter which should have a very specific meaning of the actual number of concurrent threads calling `aggregate()` on the instance of `ConcurrentGrouper`.\r\n\r\nYeah, it's more than a hint. It is the exact parallelism level.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/554767182/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/554767555","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/8878#issuecomment-554767555","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8878","id":554767555,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NDc2NzU1NQ==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-17T17:27:31Z","updated_at":"2019-11-17T17:27:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I restarted the travis job that failed.\r\n\r\nThe LGTM analysis seems hung up on an `npm` step. @vogievetsky or other npm gurus - any idea what might be going on here?

In https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/issues/7491, a new assumption has been added that `partitionId` is never greater than `Short.MAX_VALUE` to reduce the memory usage in the coordinator and the broker. This assumption makes sense to me since `partitionId` is assumed to be consecutive in most cases and having such a large number of segments in a time chunk generally doesn't happen in practice.

Yah, I just realized this limitation was introduced by the minor compaction. No, the assumption doesn't hold for our use case, as I described, we created our own Indexer based on core Druid libraries.\r\nOur Indexer pulls events from Kafka and split them into small slices to further improve the parallelism, e.g.\r\n1. Our service coordinator pulls 6M events from Kafka per partition per `Batch`, and split this batch into 6 small `Slices`.\r\n2. Then the coordinator sends this 6 slices to downstream service which is our indexer, and each indexer creates segments independently.\r\n3. To avoid having collision and creating locks between our indexer instances, we created a partition number generator which creates the partition number base on `Kafka Partition Number`, `Slice Number` and `Kafka Batch Number` (unique and maintained by our coordinator), sample rule as follows,\r\n```\r\nKafka Partition Number * PARTITION_NUMBER_MULTIPLIER + Slice Number * SLICE_NUMBER_MULTIPLIER + Kafka Batch Number % SLICE_NUMBER_MULTIPLIER\r\n```\r\n\r\nHence we have large numeric values for our partition numbers even we may not have so many segments per interval.\r\n\r\nI understand it's not trivial to modify current minor compaction, but we should state this situation clearly on the release doc - https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/releases/tag/druid-0.16.0-incubating, so that people can do some pre-checks on their system.
