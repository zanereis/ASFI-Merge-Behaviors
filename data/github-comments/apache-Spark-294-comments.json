RecordReaders get closed in a finally block after the tasks that they're used in.\n\nSo there's a race between these two and I can't think of a good way to make one execute after the other.  I'm a little confused as to why the HadoopRDD finally block is running at all.  Some googling seems to indicate that finally blocks don't run during a System.exit().  And I would think a ShutdownHook would run after that happens anyway.  So I can't claim to have 100% understanding of what's going on here.  Spark isn't closing the FileSystem on its own.\n\nMore generally, I think logging a warning is overkill on a reader close error.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/52262225/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/52262303","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1958#issuecomment-52262303","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1958","id":52262303,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMjYyMzAz","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-15T00:30:22Z","updated_at":"2014-08-15T00:30:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA tests have started for PR 1958.

We create a class called BinaryData with a method open() that returns an InputStream. The BinaryData object has information about an InputSplit inside and can thus be shuffled across the network, cached, etc. And whenever users want to read it, they can get a stream. Would this solve the problem?\n\n—\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/52267833/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/52268330","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1960#issuecomment-52268330","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1960","id":52268330,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMjY4MzMw","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-15T02:25:16Z","updated_at":"2014-08-15T02:25:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA tests have started for PR 1960.

Is the reason why we have to add the timestamp field to the event case classes themselves the following: we can't use the time when the logger actually logs the event because it's technically inaccurate? E.g. the block manager might have been added ages ago, and by the time we actually process the event many milliseconds may have already passed. This isn't a huge problem if the event queues are small, but we have seen them go up to O(100) even after #1679.
