After searching issues I found a issue about [sharding jdbc do not support batch update](https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/6665).For batch update sharding-jdbc is not support and have no plan to support because this kind of SQL may be routed to multiple data nodes, which will cause distributed transaction problems. Using mybatis foreach like below：\r\n\r\n```\r\n<update id=\"batchUpdateList\" parameterType=\"java.util.List\">\r\n    <foreach collection=\"list\" item=\"item\" separator=\";\">\r\n        update table\r\n        set name = #{item.name},\r\n        where id = #{item.id}\r\n    </foreach>\r\n</update>\r\n```\r\n\r\nActual SQL\r\n```\r\nActual SQL: ds_1 ::: update stock_change_detail_023\r\n           set \r\n           update_time = now()\r\n           where\r\n           id = ?\r\n           and tenant_id = ?\r\n           and warehouse_no = ?\r\n         ;\r\n           update stock_change_detail\r\n           set \r\n           update_time = now()\r\n           where \r\n           id = ?\r\n           and tenant_id = ?\r\n           and warehouse_no = ? ::: [[[1, jd, 26, 2, jd, 26]]]\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, I change batch update operation to single update with loop.
