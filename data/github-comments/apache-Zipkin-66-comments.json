It could certainly clear up the verbiage issue we're having.  I attached a rough mockup below of what it would look like (in IE).  Having it below the \"go to trace\" box isn't really practical as I don't think Bootstrap navs support multi-row very well (at least, I've never seen one).  Either way, I can't say it looks very clean.  It's not immediately obvious which textbox should be used for what purpose without some descriptive text around the file input.  Additionally, there are some workflow complications with doing it that way.  After selecting the file we'd have to change the URL to remove any reference to current state.  Otherwise somebody may try to copy/paste it and expect the same results.  Which won't happen.  We can use JS to fix the URL but we have to be careful with history management so the back/forward buttons work as expected.\r\n\r\nSo the short version is that I believe a dedicated page for viewing the traces is the simplest way to do it.  But I'm not sure how to disambiguate the online from offline stuff like you're concerned about.  We can consider a multi-level nav but that means extra clicks to get to a page.  With as simple as the UI is at the moment I don't think that's appropriate either.\r\n\r\n![mock-ie](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25107222/35985393-78053b4e-0cee-11e8-9da0-a4938012e071.png)\r\n\r\n> I tried the functionality and notice I can't collapse any of the spans (even clicking expand-all collapse-all). Might want to check that.\r\n\r\nWorks on my box in Zipkin 2.4.6 with this change applied.  Tried IE, FF, and Chrome.  Behaves identically to normal/stored traces.  Did those work for you?  Which version/branch were you using?\r\n\r\np.s.

I wouldn't expect as much handiness in JDBC, for example, as prepared\nstatements etc tend to be too big. Similarly cassandra has this concern.\nThat doesn't mean that a prepared statement or similar tag doesn't end up\nbeing defined in these domains. We'd cross-reference this work when doing\nsomething similar.\n\nbear in mind that http.route isn't enough for a name, as it isn't always\nthere. To make a stable name, we'd need to make constants like redirect or\nnot_found, such as micrometer do. In other words http.route is an input to\na good naming engine, but not necessarily a great name by itself.

got tests added for the span conversion stuff.  Unfortunately there is a somewhat higher level bug that may make them moot.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the /zipkin/v1/trace/{traceIdHex} has an optional query parameter to dump raw traces.  From what I can tell, getting that dump avoids some timestamp adjustments and sorting that a non-raw dump would do.  Unfortunately, it seems like /zipkin/v2/trace/{traceIdHex} defaults to the same /v1 raw behavior.  Now, it's unfortunate because the UI doesn't like it when the initial/root span isn't the first in the list of spans.  It actually fails quite miserably when that's the case.  Additionally, the lack of timestamp adjustments can cause spans to render in odd places on the timeline.  Is this something that would hold up this feature?  If so, I have no idea how I'd handle the situation at the moment.\r\n\r\nFor reference:\r\n- We just deployed Zipkin 2.4.2 to our production servers so I was using it as my test case\r\n- I dumped a normal v1 trace, a raw one, and a v2 trace for comparison\r\n- The normal v1 trace rendered properly, neither of the latter did\r\n- The raw v1 trace and v2 trace rendered identically after moving the root span up to be the first span\r\n\r\np.s.

Some people do span adjustments after the fact, like with sparkstreaming.\r\n\r\nRelying on code conventions to tell if http.route was processable or not can be a problem, if doing span renaming downstream. For example, we'd like to consistently apply a naming pattern, even if it is not found or redirected.\r\n\r\nEx zipkin, in a framework that doesn't support routes, it could be more sensible to default to the span name to http method vs have http method or not_found, for consistency's sake. Knowing a route is possible allows us to be consistent: use a template based span namer or another one, depending on what's supported.\r\n\r\nThe easiest path out is to use \"\" as a signal that there is route support, but a route didn't match (for any reason). Use \"http.status_code\" to clarify. This is similar to how we used the marker tag key \"lc\" permitting empty values.\r\n\r\nIndexing impact is limited. For example, optimized backends write one index entry per trace each time \"http.route\" -> \"\" is stored. Of course, it isn't required to be stored ever: it isn't a MUST use empty string on no match, but SHOULD.

For grouping to work, we want routes that are effectively the same, to in fact be the same. Here are a couple things on that.\r\n\r\n* Require a leading slash - prefixing with slash allows you firstly to identify a root path as different than empty string. More importantly it allows you to group \"users/:userId\" with \"/users/:userId\" which some frameworks can be inconsistent about (due to user defined template expressions)\r\n* Try to normalize paths -  For example, if a framework somehow can allow an accident of \"//users/:userId\" to strip out the extra slash. This is to help with grouping, and tests \"should\" be able to smoke this out.\r\n\r\nSeems like only one leading slash can be a MUST as it is cheap to enforce.

And I'm unaware of anyone actually using it, so can't speak to it's popularity and stability in the C* codebase.\r\n - RF=1 is not recommended. There's a reason the code logs a warning if RF remains at 1.\r\n\r\nFor what you're trying to achieve it would be smarter (imo) to use the Zipkin collector, or the kafka transport, as the buffering mechanism as you perform a rolling restart. ('ConsistencyLevel.ANY' really can't be recommended for such buffering.)\r\nFor example you could turn off the collector while performing the rolling restart (if insisting on RF=1). Maybe the collector fails gracefully (it does have a retry mechanism in place) and handles the rolling restart already?\r\n\r\nAnyway, because this is a improvement request to accept a situation that breaks two recommendations i'd be uneasy about agreeing to it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/367231935/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/367280038","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1861#issuecomment-367280038","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1861","id":367280038,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NzI4MDAzOA==","user":{"login":"michaelsembwever","id":559444,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1OTQ0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/559444?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelsembwever","html_url":"https://github.com/michaelsembwever","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelsembwever/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelsembwever/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelsembwever/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelsembwever/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelsembwever/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelsembwever/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelsembwever/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelsembwever/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelsembwever/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-21T10:26:55Z","updated_at":"2018-02-21T10:27:43Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> If the delimiter character was parameterised, then as a DelimiterTokenAnalyzer i think it would be a patch that would get excepted.

It seems like pyramid should be able to avail the route pattern somehow (even if it doesn't now). I'm looking at https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/narr/urldispatch.html#route-pattern-syntax. In spark web I've had to request the ability to see this, as they hadn't exposed it prior (eventhough it is reachable).\r\n\r\nOn your other points, I do think that http.route isn't necessary, as in necessary for all, but it is a nice choice that is still http abstraction.. and certainly helps some or else they wouldn't have done similar ad-hoc. As not necessary, I mean a symbolic route name or function name can also be a nice tag and/or span name. Just such are more pinned to the application abstraction vs http, which could be a pro or con depending on POV. For example, regardless of syntax.. /users/{userId} /users/:userId /users/* etc people who don't know the app probably can figure out what the route means in context of the http request. Similarly constants like not_found redirected are fairly intuitive and explain the http layer reasonably well. Importantly, presence of http.route does not mean don't add another identifier like a generated one or otherwise.. for example, in java code there are often other tags for the method the request dispatched to.\r\n\r\nDoes this make sense?

Thanks for thinking with us. The problem we have is that we need to ingress a lot of services/backends in the same namespace and domain, as you can see in the configuration file above. I can only set the annotations on the top level and they will be applied to all services/backends. If I only had Zipkin, then my rewrite-target would be '/zipkin'. We need to set it to '/' so that we can use it for e.g. Kibana, Grafana and Prometheus at the same time. Those services have settings with which you can make them work with the ingress controller with the settings above. Hopefully there is already something similar in Zipkin and/or it is easy to investigate if it can be made to work in Zipkin.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/368254796/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/368259719","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1731#issuecomment-368259719","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1731","id":368259719,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2ODI1OTcxOQ==","user":{"login":"abesto","id":59982,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5OTgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59982?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abesto","html_url":"https://github.com/abesto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abesto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abesto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abesto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abesto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abesto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abesto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abesto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abesto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abesto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-24T20:57:54Z","updated_at":"2018-02-24T20:57:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@wdittmer Thanks for the detailed response. So translating this to my non-k8s-trained mind: annotations apply globally to the ingress definition, but this specific rule would need to apply to just one backend, so like you've already explained before, this is not possible to implement from the k8s side.\r\n\r\nFWIW, to me it'd be weird anyway to depend on a reverse proxy to rewrite HTML content. Since the HTML is served up in this setup by something “we” (as in OpenZipkin) control, it shouldn't be hard to implement logic similar to Kibana and Prometheus in Zipkin. I believe the backend for the UI in this setup is _the_ Zipkin backend, so we should be able to conditionally inject the HTML `<base>` tag based on an ENV var. @adriancole am I making any wrong assumptions here / messing up the conclusion?\r\n\r\n(Meta: should we move this discussion to a separate issue?)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/368259719/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/368273820","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/1929#issuecomment-368273820","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1929","id":368273820,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2ODI3MzgyMA==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-25T01:05:01Z","updated_at":"2018-02-25T01:05:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"great. thanks again @igorwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww !","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/368273820/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/368274011","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1731#issuecomment-368274011","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1731","id":368274011,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2ODI3NDAxMQ==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-25T01:08:49Z","updated_at":"2018-02-25T01:08:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":">\n> I believe the backend for the UI in this setup is *the* Zipkin backend,\n> so we should be able to conditionally inject the HTML <base> tag based on\n> an ENV var. @adriancole <https://github.com/adriancole> am I making any\n> wrong assumptions here / messing up the conclusion?\n>\nYes I think we are at a point where we need to rewrite HTML to accomplish\nthe goal.
