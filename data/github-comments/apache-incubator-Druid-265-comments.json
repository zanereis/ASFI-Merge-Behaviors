to me, it looks easier to add unit tests to `KafkaRecordSupplierTest`. I guess perhaps you could parameterize that class to test both byte array serde and a simple custom serde. This custom serde doesn't have to be the one you're using. It can be any custom serde. Alternatively, you can add a new test class to only verify that the custom serde works with `KafkaRecordSupplier`. \r\n\r\nI prefer the former one because we can test both default and custom serdes in a single place. But, if it's not feasible or too complex, then I'm ok with adding a new test class.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/514421963/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/514425389","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/8135#issuecomment-514425389","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8135","id":514425389,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNDQyNTM4OQ==","user":{"login":"jon-wei","id":8729063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MjkwNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8729063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei","html_url":"https://github.com/jon-wei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-23T23:55:14Z","updated_at":"2019-07-23T23:55:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@clintropolis Reverting #8073 sounds good","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/514425389/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/514429791","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/8135#issuecomment-514429791","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8135","id":514429791,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNDQyOTc5MQ==","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-24T00:17:47Z","updated_at":"2019-07-24T00:17:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Raised https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/pull/8143.

This causes the lifecycle stop on the indexer to hang during graceful task stop, because the task is waiting to hear from the overlord a message it will never be able to hear without a running jetty. \r\n\r\nThe supervisor on the overlord is then forever stuck in a loop, performing an action it can never complete because the indexer has stopped listening.\r\n\r\n```2019-07-24T01:58:21,268 INFO [KafkaSupervisor-wikipedia] org.apache.druid.indexing.seekablestream.supervisor.SeekableStreamSupervisor - [wikipedia] supervisor is running.\r\n2019-07-24T01:58:21,268 INFO [KafkaSupervisor-wikipedia] org.apache.druid.indexing.seekablestream.supervisor.SeekableStreamSupervisor - {id='wikipedia', generationTime=2019-07-24T01:58:21.268Z, payload=KafkaSupervisorReportPayload{dataSource='wikipedia', topic='wikipedia', partitions=1, replicas=2, durationSeconds=600, active=[{id='index_kafka_wikipedia_ed020815fc3c3f4_bebmfiod', startTime=2019-07-24T01:55:50.422Z, remainingSeconds=449}, {id='index_kafka_wikipedia_ed020815fc3c3f4_cfcibngo', startTime=2019-07-24T01:55:50.525Z, remainingSeconds=449}], publishing=[], suspended=false, healthy=true, state=RUNNING, detailedState=RUNNING, recentErrors=[]}}\r\n2019-07-24T01:58:36,268 INFO [IndexTaskClient-wikipedia-0] org.apache.druid.indexing.common.IndexTaskClient - submitRequest failed for [http://localhost:8092/druid/worker/v1/chat/index_kafka_wikipedia_ed020815fc3c3f4_bebmfiod/offsets/current], with message [Connection refused (Connection refused)]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe indexer eventually gives up after 5 minute timeout and ungracefully stops, but the supervisor/overlord appears to remain stuck until either the indexer comes back on the same host/port or the overlord is restarted. This also jams up what the web ui displays as the task status, where the task of the stuck indexer remains in the 'running' state until the same condition of the indexer returning or the overlord is restarting is met.\r\n\r\nThis issue aside, I'm still +1 on this if you'd rather fix this in a follow-up PR, since this is currently an undocumented feature anyway.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/514496119/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/514508227","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/8147#issuecomment-514508227","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8147","id":514508227,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNDUwODIyNw==","user":{"login":"ighack","id":6670377,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NzAzNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6670377?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ighack","html_url":"https://github.com/ighack","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ighack/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ighack/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ighack/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ighack/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ighack/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ighack/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ighack/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ighack/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ighack/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-24T07:05:44Z","updated_at":"2019-07-24T07:08:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"```\r\n\"metricsSpec\": [\r\n{\"name\": \"views\", \"type\": \"count\"},\r\n{\"name\": \"latencyMs_SUM\", \"type\": \"doubleSum\", \"fieldName\": \"latencyMs\"}\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nselect sum(latencyMs) from mytable\r\nor\r\nselect latencyMs_SUM from mytable\r\n\r\nwhice one is right?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/514508227/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/514534791","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/8135#issuecomment-514534791","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8135","id":514534791,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNDUzNDc5MQ==","user":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-24T08:31:19Z","updated_at":"2019-07-24T08:31:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@asdf2014 Yes, we cannot bundle the annotations with Druid, since the license is incompatible with Apache.

It is best to avoid such objects, but if they do exist, then checking Boolean objects for equality using == or != will give results than are different than you would get using .equals(...)\r\n\r\n<hr> \r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n  [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/514834543/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/514837303","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/8151#issuecomment-514837303","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8151","id":514837303,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNDgzNzMwMw==","user":{"login":"clintropolis","id":1577461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzc0NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1577461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis","html_url":"https://github.com/clintropolis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-24T23:33:55Z","updated_at":"2019-07-24T23:33:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"teamcity seems to be failing with the same unrelated errors for these backports to 0.15.1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/514837303/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/514837508","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/8125#issuecomment-514837508","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8125","id":514837508,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNDgzNzUwOA==","user":{"login":"himanshug","id":246308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjMwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug","html_url":"https://github.com/himanshug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-24T23:34:52Z","updated_at":"2019-07-24T23:34:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> is it really a good idea to try to compute cache entries asynchronously and in parallel?\r\n\r\nI think, no . it is ok to compute the entry in the same thread reading sequence.\r\n\r\n> is it a good idea to have background cache population be a generic thing at all?

Then we can \r\n\r\n* remove all of the old consoles from the codebase\r\n* have more opportunity for visibility when the cluster is in a degraded state\r\n\r\nI think the former is important to me from a development/code hygiene/maintenance standpoint, and Druid itself would seem much more coherent if it didn't have a bunch of random old web interfaces that look nothing like the new one scattered everywhere.\r\n\r\nThe latter feels important for large clusters, as the current console is sort of a happy path console. It does have some graceful degradation, but it still requires _multiple_ nodes to be functioning for it to work. I think there is value in being able to still load the traditionally coordinator views directly from the coordinator, or the indexing views from the overlord, in cases where other parts of the cluster are down.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/515179768/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/515226198","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/8144#issuecomment-515226198","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8144","id":515226198,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNTIyNjE5OA==","user":{"login":"vogievetsky","id":177816,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzgxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177816?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky","html_url":"https://github.com/vogievetsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-25T21:44:13Z","updated_at":"2019-07-25T21:44:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you for the fixes! 👍 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/515226198/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/515321136","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/8152#issuecomment-515321136","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8152","id":515321136,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNTMyMTEzNg==","user":{"login":"clintropolis","id":1577461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzc0NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1577461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis","html_url":"https://github.com/clintropolis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-26T06:02:10Z","updated_at":"2019-07-26T06:02:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The integration test and teamcity keep failing for this.
