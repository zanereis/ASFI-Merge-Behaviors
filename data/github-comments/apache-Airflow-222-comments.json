I believe my commit permissions still have to propagate, but LGTM.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/486086339/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/486086718","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5167#issuecomment-486086718","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5167","id":486086718,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NjA4NjcxOA==","user":{"login":"feng-tao","id":3223098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjMwOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3223098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao","html_url":"https://github.com/feng-tao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-24T06:30:46Z","updated_at":"2019-04-24T06:30:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@potiuk , nice work :) 👍 I wonder what is your approach to root cause the issue is due to multiprocessing.Queue.empty()?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/486086718/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/486086813","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5127#issuecomment-486086813","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5127","id":486086813,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NjA4NjgxMw==","user":{"login":"sdikby","id":12047164,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDQ3MTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12047164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdikby","html_url":"https://github.com/sdikby","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdikby/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdikby/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdikby/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdikby/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdikby/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdikby/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdikby/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdikby/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdikby/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-24T06:31:13Z","updated_at":"2019-04-24T06:31:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@ashb Nice feature.

And I think we already think about replacing the nvd3 library soon-ish (I saw that we are looking for nvd3 replacement for example) - which in turn will remove the need for slugify.\r\n\r\nI don't really think there is harm in modifying the files - there is a very slim chance we are going to upgrade to a later version, but even if we do - we should be able to re-apply our own changes anyway. We try to make it in separate commits (https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5168) so that we can later cherry-pick those changes in case we want to upgrade to newer version of the library. \r\n\r\nI think this current change here was a bit unfortunate because the slugify change was not separated out to separate commit, but it's so small change that it will be no problem to re-apply it in case we upgrade.\r\n\r\nI guess there are also no licensing limitations that would prevent us from doing so - both libs are MIT licence that allows us to modify this code.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/486087993/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/486090076","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5019#issuecomment-486090076","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5019","id":486090076,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NjA5MDA3Ng==","user":{"login":"feng-tao","id":3223098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjMwOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3223098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao","html_url":"https://github.com/feng-tao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-24T06:44:06Z","updated_at":"2019-04-24T06:44:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"thanks @potiuk for the explanation:) Make sense.

I'm curious to know what was the concerns back then but from my point of view we should be good, only that we need to be careful about the way we create new DAG run--the current implementation would be problematic if we have DAG with large number of dag run pending as we check the `max_active_runs` later on and creating all the pending DAG runs one by one is not the most efficient way.\r\n\r\nAbout the concern of task scheduling, I'm 100% following what @vijaysbhat was describing but this change would definitely be very helpful for Airflow to schedule task faster. Esp. for those DAGs want to catch up from an old execution_date and those cluster with long scheduler DAG file parsing interval.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/486513814/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/486520336","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5179#issuecomment-486520336","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5179","id":486520336,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NjUyMDMzNg==","user":{"login":"milton0825","id":6065051,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNjUwNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6065051?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825","html_url":"https://github.com/milton0825","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-25T05:02:08Z","updated_at":"2019-04-25T05:02:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"tests passed on: https://travis-ci.org/milton0825/airflow/builds/524299752","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/486520336/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/486524033","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5179#issuecomment-486524033","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5179","id":486524033,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NjUyNDAzMw==","user":{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-25T05:24:41Z","updated_at":"2019-04-25T05:24:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks @milton0825 for the fix.\r\n\r\nI have restarted the failing test here.

Using that as a frontend for visualizing / searching logs seems like quite a useful central feature to have as compared to a plugin. Semantically we'd use extra links plugin for features that are more specific to each individual Airflow DAG / Task / Provider.\r\n - This can be quite easily integrated and extended like the existing download logs / view logs, and seems on the same plane w.r.t. utility.\r\n - Also referring to the proposed metrics changes in this PR (https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5139), having a standalone endpoint for serving logs allows us to track metrics for just that endpoint better than a common extra links section. (like tracking views and failures, etc). \r\n\r\nThoughts?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/486761108/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/486813713","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5185#issuecomment-486813713","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5185","id":486813713,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NjgxMzcxMw==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-25T19:49:27Z","updated_at":"2019-04-30T13:56:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/5185?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#5185](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/5185?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/commit/188b3193c7a5484253a13ad293e124569e8a2c04?src=pr&el=desc) will **increase** coverage by `<.01%`.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/5185/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=WdLKlKHOAU&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/5185?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@            Coverage Diff             @@\n##           master    #5185      +/-   ##\n==========================================\n+ Coverage   78.54%   78.55%   +<.01%     \n==========================================\n  Files         469      469              \n  Lines       29952    29952              \n==========================================\n+ Hits        23527    23528       +1     \n+ Misses       6425     6424       -1\n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/5185?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [airflow/models/taskinstance.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/5185/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9tb2RlbHMvdGFza2luc3RhbmNlLnB5) | `92.59% <0%> (+0.17%)` | :arrow_up: |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/5185?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/5185?src=pr&el=footer).
