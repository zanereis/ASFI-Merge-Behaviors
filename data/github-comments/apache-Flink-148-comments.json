@mushketyk , thanks for the updating. \r\n\r\nRegarding to the `TableSource` , currently, there are 8 `TableSource` interfaces provided to users including trait and abstract class. It is a little hard to choose which one to use to implement a custom table source. What about to implement `TableSource` as abstract class and provide default implementation for `getFieldNames()` and `getFieldsIndices()`. And provide three other abstract class : `BatchTableSource` (with `getDataSet` interface) , `StreamTableSource` (with `getDataStream` interface) and `BatchStreamTableSource` (with both interfaces), they all extend `TableSource`. In this way, we only provide 4 classes to user, the implementers should extend one of the latter three abstract class. What do you think ?

Make `StreamTableSource` extend `TableSource` abstract class and implement  `DataStreamGetter` interface. And  make `BatchStreamTableSource` implement both `DataSetGetter` and `DataStreamGetter`.  So that we can use `TableSource` plus `DataSetGetter` where only `BatchTableSource` is expected. For example, the `BatchTableSourceScan` can be changed to like this: \r\n\r\n```scala\r\nclass BatchTableSourceScan(\r\n    cluster: RelOptCluster,\r\n    traitSet: RelTraitSet,\r\n    table: RelOptTable,\r\n    val tableSource: TableSource[_],\r\n    val datasetGetter: DataSetGetter)\r\n```\r\n\r\nCan this solve our problem ? \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/270279725/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/270329375","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3047#issuecomment-270329375","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3047","id":270329375,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MDMyOTM3NQ==","user":{"login":"shijinkui","id":648508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0ODUwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/648508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shijinkui","html_url":"https://github.com/shijinkui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shijinkui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shijinkui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shijinkui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shijinkui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shijinkui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shijinkui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shijinkui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shijinkui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shijinkui/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-04T09:30:51Z","updated_at":"2017-01-04T09:30:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Same to FLINK-4861. close it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/270329375/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/270443497","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3056#issuecomment-270443497","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3056","id":270443497,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MDQ0MzQ5Nw==","user":{"login":"rmetzger","id":89049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger","html_url":"https://github.com/rmetzger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-04T18:14:16Z","updated_at":"2017-01-04T18:14:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you for looking into the issue.
