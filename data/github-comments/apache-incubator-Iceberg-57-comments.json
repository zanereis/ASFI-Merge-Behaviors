We don't need to support it to support the Schema DDL, so it would be fine with me to throw an exception and reject its use for now.\r\n\r\nIn the long term, I think we do want Iceberg partitioning to be exposed in the normal way for Hive because it would be confusing for a partitioned Iceberg table to show up as unpartitioned. That said, there are significant differences between the two partitioning approaches:\r\n1. Partitioning never changes the table schema, but Hive partition columns are always at the end\r\n2. Hive partition columns can't be changed\r\n3. Iceberg supports hidden partitions that can't be shown in Hive\r\n\r\nThe differences may be significant enough that it would cause problems to expose even Iceberg identity partitions to Hive. For example, if Hive expects to get a partition key and fill in data values, then that would be a problem.\r\n\r\nWhat are the chances of integrating Iceberg into Hive itself and solving some of these limitations?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/715592301/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/715594455","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1559#issuecomment-715594455","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1559","id":715594455,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxNTU5NDQ1NQ==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-23T21:17:43Z","updated_at":"2020-10-23T21:19:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Good to understand the points about rename with overwrite flag.

Those also expose some test gaps.\r\n> \r\n> Otherwise, there are two things I'd fix:\r\n> \r\n> * It would be really nice to depend on only one version of the AWS SDK. If the URI class is only used to parse path and bucket, can we replace it with something? @jackye1995, any ideas?\r\n> * Implement `create`. We can do this in a follow-up, but it seems like it will bite us if we don't and forget\r\n\r\nI expanded the read path testing to cover a number of other cases.\r\n\r\nI agree it's not ideal to depend on v1 and v2 of the SDK, but they are intended to coexist and from what I can see there isn't a current alternative to the `AmazonS3URI` class, I'd rather not create a utility just to mimic that behavior.\r\n\r\nI actually disagree with implementing `create()` because, as I mentioned earlier, just about any scenario depending on \"create if not exists\" behavior is risky with S3.  Considering that the object doesn't even appear until a stream is closed, which can be any amount of time, it leads to any number of potential race conditions.  Seeing as how `create()` is not used anywhere currently, we should leave this unimplemented until the need arises and revisit this decision at that time.

There are two reasons we don't do this already:\r\n\r\n1. The catalog must be defined in Spark properties, so we either need to have a \"default\" catalog or have a way to configure a catalog for the source\r\n2. If we use a catalog, then we still need to support path-based tables. We will need to add a way to pass a path as an identifier to the catalog and have it load using `HadoopTables`\r\n\r\nFiguring out how we want to do this shouldn't be too difficult.

This looks like a great start and mostly correct to me.\r\n> \r\n> What is the plan for atomic commits? I don't see locking in this PR, so it looks like that will be added later with some configuration to enable it and point a catalog to a dynamo instance? It would also be great to know what the timeline for an atomic swap in Glue is. Maybe we could avoid adding the external locking, although it may be useful to have an external locking option.\r\n\r\nCurrently the `doCommit` method uses Glue's `ConcurrentModificationException` to detect commit conflicts. However, because we are doing a client-side compare-and-swap, there is still a potential race condition. But the code should still work for low concurrency use cases. I am actively discussing with Glue about a native support, but it's not a very common use case for them to support yet at this point of time.\r\n\r\nYes, there will be another PR for adding the DynamoDB locking. When I add that, it will be enabled based on a config value, and user can choose to enable it or not based on the access pattern. As discussed in the original draft, I did not include this functionality to control the size of the PR. I already have the code, just waiting for this PR to be merged before adding that support.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/718143478/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/718144692","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1051#issuecomment-718144692","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1051","id":718144692,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxODE0NDY5Mg==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-28T19:02:05Z","updated_at":"2020-10-28T19:02:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm going to close this for now.
