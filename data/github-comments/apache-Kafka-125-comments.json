@rajinisivaram about \r\n\r\n> Looks like we are allowing some clients using the static jaas config and other clients using different dynamic jaas config properties to co-exist in the same JVM.

I am not sure I fully understand what you mean, but what do you think if I add the code like this:\r\nIn WindowedSerializer.configure method, \r\n`if (inner == null) {`\r\n`    inner = new ProducerConfig(configs).getConfiguredInstance(isKey ? \"key.serializer\" : \"value.serializer\", Serializer.class);`\r\n`    inner.configure(configs, isKey);`\r\n`}`\r\nHowever, seems that we have to modify the access level for ProducerConfig init to 'public', do you live with that?\r\n\r\nBesides, that's the unit test code:\r\n`@Test\r\n    public void testWindowedSerdeNoArgConstructors() {\r\n\r\n        WindowedSerializer<StringSerializer> windowedSerializer = new WindowedSerializer<>();\r\n\r\n        Map<String, String> props = new HashMap<>();\r\n\r\n

Refined the code as per your suggestions. Now all the unit test cases should pass. Since we already have about 7 unit test cases (such as FileRecordsTest.testRead), do you think we still need to add new test cases for this method?

My concern is that just seeing a message generated by the task isn't actually enough to be sure the topic has been created. (In practice, I'm pretty sure we'd not see an issue with this, but as we're closing a few correctness gaps in system tests that came back to bite us, it seems better to get a fix that properly guarantees correctness.)

In principle, seems like a fair change. A couple of thoughts:\r\n\r\n1. Is there a significant benefit to this? It seems the copyrights that it standardized mostly just had slight variants that aren't all that significant -- mostly just longer line widths. These changes admittedly don't affect git history in any significant way since they are just copyrights, but it's still a huge change (tied with some actual code changes as described in the next item).\r\n2. We have quite a few unrelated changes in imports in the patch. Normally I wouldn't worry about these since IDEs do this automatically and the scope is usually pretty limited, but this touches a *lot* of files. I think it's fine to change it, I'm primarily worried about how this will end up impacting a bunch of other in-flight PRs.\r\n3. If we merge this, maybe we should give folks a heads up on the -dev list? IDE settings are probably how we got the 3 or 4 different variants of the header already.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/270579242/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/270579986","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2315#issuecomment-270579986","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2315","id":270579986,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MDU3OTk4Ng==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-05T07:21:12Z","updated_at":"2017-01-05T07:21:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer
