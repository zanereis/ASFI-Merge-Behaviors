In practice, input data is gaussian or sub-gaussian and highly correlated. Anyway this observation made me dubious about modifying algorithms to make them on average more accurate with a random distribution that might not reflect the data that they will be used with in practice. I think a proper error analysis would be measured in Resnet-34 or Resnet-50 using actual weights and real images.\r\n\r\nAlso here are some  optimizations that are often overlooked.\r\n\r\n1) It is possible to use different algorithms for the horizontal and vertical dimensions of a 2D convolution. So you could nest F(4,3) with F(2,3) for example (call it `F(4x2, 3x3)`), or even F(6,3) with direct convolution, `F(6x1, 3x3)`.\r\n\r\n2) Loop partitioning and reordering can make a big difference in the efficiency of any dense computation, and Winograd/Cook/Toom conv2d is no different. Look to fit a super-tile of transform -> batch matrix multiply -> inverse transform in the innermost loops, so that the transform data stays in the fastest memory (eg shared memory on GPU, L1/L2 cache on CPU). This is important, because the fast convolution algorithms decrease computational density by simultaneously expanding the input data and reducing the number of arithmetic operations.\r\n\r\n3) In order to make the inner loop of 2) efficient, you probably need to use a small tile algorithm for the inner loop, otherwise computational density will be too low and you will be memory bound. Consider using 1) to nest a 1D fast algorithm with a 1D direct convolution (1D tiles are the smallest!), or move a large tile 1D algorithm to the outer loop (so that it goes to DRAM on GPU or L3 cache on CPU), and do a small tile 1D algorithm in the inner loop.\r\n\r\nSorry this is so long. I did not have the time to make it shorter. ;-)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/513369643/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/513378307","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3489#issuecomment-513378307","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3489","id":513378307,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMzM3ODMwNw==","user":{"login":"yongsun","id":23637,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23637?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongsun","html_url":"https://github.com/yongsun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongsun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongsun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongsun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongsun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongsun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongsun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongsun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongsun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongsun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-19T21:06:41Z","updated_at":"2019-07-19T21:06:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> OK.

We do that currently for backends relying on Xilinx IPI flows (i.e. pynq), it helps reducing some lines to maintain in tcl (see [here](https://github.com/Xilinx/SDAccel_Examples/blob/master/getting_started/rtl_kernel/rtl_vadd/scripts/package_kernel.tcl#L53-L54)).\r\n\r\nIf there is no pattern-matching option available in Quartus, then maybe we can just instantiate [VTAShell](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/master/vta/hardware/chisel/src/main/scala/test/Test.scala#L32) directly in the [Config](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/02ca7141f8d199cddb870b7bfc8120a481914323/vta/hardware/chisel/src/main/scala/vta/Configs.scala#L51).

If there is any, I would be very glad to use and reform the tcl script.\r\n\r\nThe reason why I didn't \"instantiate VTAShell directly in the Config\" is that Intel's implement of AXI bus is slightly different from Xilinx's counterpart. Specifically, it is **required** to provide `arprot` and `awprot` port in Intel's AXILite, although the ports are not connected to any module internally in VTA. Also, Intel only support burst length of 4-bits instead of the default 8-bit in `VTAShell`. Therefore, I currently instantiated `IntelAXILiteClient` and `IntelAXIMaster` in `IntelShell`. On the other hand, I was just thinking, since there is an [XilinxShell](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/02ca7141f8d199cddb870b7bfc8120a481914323/vta/hardware/chisel/src/main/scala/shell/XilinxShell.scala#L32) implemented, why not just add another `IntelShell`.\r\n\r\nAn alternative option I could have is to create `arprot` and `awprot` in the commonly used `AXILiteClient` and `AXILiteMaster`, and configure `VTAShell` to use 4-bit burst length directly for `de10-nano`.\r\n\r\n@tmoreau89 What do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/513842743/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/513863243","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3494#issuecomment-513863243","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3494","id":513863243,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMzg2MzI0Mw==","user":{"login":"vegaluisjose","id":2478335,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzgzMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2478335?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vegaluisjose","html_url":"https://github.com/vegaluisjose","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vegaluisjose/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vegaluisjose/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vegaluisjose/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vegaluisjose/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vegaluisjose/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vegaluisjose/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vegaluisjose/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vegaluisjose/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vegaluisjose/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-22T16:47:54Z","updated_at":"2019-07-22T16:47:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Interesting,\r\n\r\nWe can configure burst length bits in the Config file and that will automatically configure `VTAShell`.

experience, I ever did a vta change to let compute module do the 'weight' loading instead of let load module do that, doing so means we need to change the VTA runtime logic and hardware change, I first did the change in VTA runtime . I run it on simulator and every thing is work, then I changed hardware and i put new hardware with this new runtime together, the hardware stuck,  the problem trouble shooting very consume time ,first bitstream build time is very long, secondly the hardware debug is not so straightforward, Finally I found the issue caused by a dependency setting issue and be VTA Runtime problem, but to find such root cause I need to spend lot of effort in hardware part for isolation, if that time simulator can do the synchronization(tlpp)/dependency check, I can find the run time problem without involve hardware and save time, that is what i means , software and hardware developing decouple and catch bug help. \r\n\r\nRegards\r\nHua","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/513932462/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/513932498","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3531#issuecomment-513932498","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3531","id":513932498,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMzkzMjQ5OA==","user":{"login":"anijain2305","id":13822661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODIyNjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13822661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305","html_url":"https://github.com/anijain2305","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-22T20:01:37Z","updated_at":"2019-07-22T20:01:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@u99127 Thanks for going through the code in detail.

Instead of complicating the Conv2D API, our proposal is to add a bias_add after the qnn.conv2d. Relay fusion will itself fuse the computation.\r\n* TFLite and QNNPACK also have output_scale and output_zero_point. This is again because they want to fuse conv + bias + requantize in one op. We will have all of these 3 ops separately, connected by the framework parser depending on the framework graph. We will rely on Relay fusion. \r\n* TFLite also has output_min_activation/max_Activation because of fused relu. We can easily call a clip operator to do that.\r\n\r\nAn example of conversion from TFLite to Relay graph will look like this.\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13822661/61725395-93b43700-ad24-11e9-8956-dfea536bf2ef.png)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/514037896/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/514038090","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/3301#issuecomment-514038090","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3301","id":514038090,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNDAzODA5MA==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-23T03:21:05Z","updated_at":"2019-07-23T03:21:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"ping @yzhliu ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/514038090/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/514038094","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3555#issuecomment-514038094","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3555","id":514038094,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNDAzODA5NA==","user":{"login":"tmoreau89","id":5974488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQ0ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89","html_url":"https://github.com/tmoreau89","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-23T03:21:06Z","updated_at":"2019-07-23T03:21:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"One thing I'd argue (and I believe @tqchen and @vegaluisjose agree) is that MT is not necessary to ensure correctness of dependence mechanmisms.
