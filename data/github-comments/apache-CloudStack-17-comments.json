Rohit,\nSorry for spamming you guys so hard this weekend eheh :)\nI've found the problem, but it's still not properly fixed. Cause seems to\nbe a 20k+ string in XenTest.java\nGave me some work to make that a StringBuilder instead of just adding\nstrings.. this should use a lot less heap and cpu, but now it seems to be\nfailing consistently, although build doesn't stop because i've put a flag\non the compiler plugin to continue anyway.\nWill squash the whole thing when i get all SUCCESS instead of UNSTABLE ;)\nAlthough 0 travis failures so far.. yay for the other fix hehe\n\nOn Sun, Jun 21, 2015 at 7:47 PM, Rohit Yadav notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> Looks like you've got it @rsafonseca

The minor improvements i referred to are simply getting rid of some lint checker warnings about serializable classes not having the serialversionuid and doing redundant explicit casts. Also added a couple of non declared dependencies to the pom, and that's it

we continue in a face-to-face chat, which would be better, just few point to take into account:\n- The Profiler class is used as a profiler, to just measure how long a code took to be executed; used along with sleep calls - like a stop watch; and, still, as a monitor - there are lock implementations based on it. It makes the Profile class a profile, a stop-watch and a monitor.\n- From a profiler perspective, do a Star, wait for 1 second, then a Stop and check how long it took to compute doesn't seem right to me.\n\nThe comments above are only related to the fact that the Profiler class is being exploited inside ACS.\n\nConcerning the getDuration(). I agree that once it is taken into account to calculate milliseconds, it will be flaw.\n\nIn that case, it's too bad I trusted the existing test - which has a glitch in the assertion.\n\nMy suggestion is to refactor the getDuration(), renaming it into getDurationInMillis() and create a getDuration() which returns the nanotime - microseconds. The test has to be fixed as well.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/114421017/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/114432879","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/510#issuecomment-114432879","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/510","id":114432879,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNDQzMjg3OQ==","user":{"login":"DaanHoogland","id":2486961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODY5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2486961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland","html_url":"https://github.com/DaanHoogland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-23T10:24:34Z","updated_at":"2015-06-23T10:24:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"why should we return machines that no longer exist?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/114432879/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/114435233","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/497#issuecomment-114435233","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/497","id":114435233,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNDQzNTIzMw==","user":{"login":"karuturi","id":186833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjgzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/186833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi","html_url":"https://github.com/karuturi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-23T10:27:28Z","updated_at":"2015-06-23T10:27:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for the update @rsafonseca \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/114435233/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/114465874","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/510#issuecomment-114465874","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/510","id":114465874,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNDQ2NTg3NA==","user":{"login":"resmo","id":23809,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23809?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/resmo","html_url":"https://github.com/resmo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/resmo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/resmo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/resmo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/resmo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/resmo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/resmo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/resmo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/resmo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/resmo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-23T11:53:11Z","updated_at":"2015-06-23T11:56:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@DaanHoogland We already do :).
