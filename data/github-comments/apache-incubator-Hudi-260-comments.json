For multiple update actions, how would overlapping matched actions be evaluated?\r\n> \r\n> For example:\r\n> \r\n> ```sql\r\n> when matched and target.age = -1 then update set name = source.name, age = source.age\r\n> when matched and target.age > -10 then update set name = source.name\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> I am not really sure how traditional SQL parsers/engines handle these situations.\r\n\r\n@voonhous @fengjian428 Let's take this implementation discussion to the JIRA HUDI-4361. We should prioritize this improvement in the next release (0.13.0). Since the issue itself has been triaged, I am going to close it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1202059274/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1202059975","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/5629#issuecomment-1202059975","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/5629","id":1202059975,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5HpfrH","user":{"login":"danny0405","id":7644508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NDQ1MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7644508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405","html_url":"https://github.com/danny0405","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-02T06:11:28Z","updated_at":"2022-08-02T06:11:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I don't think we are aligned on this one: Hudi is and will be staying engine-neutral project. However for the top-of-the-line performance on _any_ engine (to stay competitive with other formats) we _have to_ use engine-specific representations (think `Row`, `RowData`, `ArrayWritable`, Arrow, etc). There's just no other way\r\n\r\nI do have some different thoughts, performance is on first priority if it is critical, say Hudi performs bad on some benchmark, but for the long run, i do think as a storage we should have our own data structures/reader writers/schema like every storage engine do, looks like how easy it is to a new engine to integrate with Iceberg and how hard it is for Hudi, the ease to integrate  is important for the ecosystem especially as a `format`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1202059975/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1202080927","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/6245#issuecomment-1202080927","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/6245","id":1202080927,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5Hpkyf","user":{"login":"JerryYue-M","id":10253313,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjUzMzEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10253313?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JerryYue-M","html_url":"https://github.com/JerryYue-M","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JerryYue-M/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JerryYue-M/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JerryYue-M/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JerryYue-M/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JerryYue-M/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JerryYue-M/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JerryYue-M/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JerryYue-M/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JerryYue-M/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-02T06:41:38Z","updated_at":"2022-08-02T06:41:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"this

嘿@qianchutao，我能够解决这个问题，也许该解决方案也可以帮助你。 因此，基本上会发生此错误，因为镶木地板文件中声明的模式与 Athena / Presto 上的表模式 ddl 之间的顺序不匹配。这通常适用于 Athena，因为在 Athena 上映射列的默认方法是使用名称 [1]，对于 Presto，默认方式是按列索引 [2]，因此当您进行架构演变或出于某种原因列的顺序时parquet 文件和表模式之间不匹配，这开始发生，与 hudi 本身无关。\r\n> \r\n> 要解决此问题，请`hive.parquet.use-column-names=true`在 EMR 配置选项卡下或在启动时添加配置，这将更新配置文件并重新启动 presto 集群。如果您想在正在运行的集群上执行此操作，您需要在主节点和工作节点上执行并重新启动 presto，否则配置将不起作用。\r\n> \r\n>
