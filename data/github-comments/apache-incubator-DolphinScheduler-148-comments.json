Search before asking\n\n-[X] I had searched in the [issues](https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues?q=is%3Aissue) and found no similar issues.\n\n\n### What happened\n\nbranch: dev\r\nDevelopment branch\r\n\r\nWhen use standalone server, the DolphinPluginManager looks for plugin dependencies from local maven repository. but the local maven repository is a fixed value in `DolphinPluginManagerConfig.java` who's value is `${user.home}/.m2/repository`.\r\nWhen using local stand-alone development, the plugin loader will load the plugin from the local Maven repository, but the value of the local repository is hard-coded in the code: `${user.home}/.m2/repository`.\r\n\r\nIn my developement envirionment, I set the maven local repository path (localRepository) to `D:\\\\repository` in `${user.home}/.m2/settings.xml`.\r\nIn my development environment, I set the address of the local repository (localRepository) in the Maven configuration file `${user.home}/.m2/settings.xml`\r\n![Local Maven Repository Settings](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23203149/139199519-7c7705a3-5d3d-4931-93ce-e2d1affc137f.png)\r\n\r\nso that the plugin manager could not load plugin correctly\r\nTherefore, the plugin loader cannot load the plugin correctly\n\n### What you expected to happen\n\n* we should load from settings.xml firstly\r\n  1. load from `${user.home}/.m2/settings.xml`\r\n  2. if `${user.home}/.m2/settings.xml` not exists, load from `${MAVEN_HOME}/conf/settings.xml`\r\n* if settings.xml not exists or the node `localRepository` not exists in settings.xml, use default value\n\n### How to reproduce\n\n* set local repository into another path in ide\r\n* start standalone server\n\n### Anything else\n\n_No response_\n\n### Are you willing to submit PR?\n\n-[X] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n-[X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of
