things.\r\n\r\nWould be good to get some extra input from people experienced with Hive on whether this is the right API or if there are any pitfalls to avoid.\r\n\r\n@jbonofre -\r\n- javadoc is not correct in HiveIO (it says write() for read ;)).\r\n- estimated size is global to the table (doesn't consider the filter). It's not a big deal, but it should be documented.\r\n- you don't use the desired bundle size provided by the runner for the split. \r\nYou are using the Hive split count, which is fine, just explain in the main javadoc maybe.\r\n- the reader should set current to null with nothing is read\r\n- getCurrent() should throw NoSuchElementException in case of current is null\r\n- in the writer, the flush should happen at the end of the batch as you did, but also when the bundle is finished\r\n\r\n@iemejia -\r\nmaybe it is a good idea for the guys working on the Beam SQL implementation to take a look at their needs for this IO considering that it could be quite useful to test the SQL (given the structured nature of

and @jkff you are right about the fact that GroupIntoBatches is a good simplification for this code however I don't think we should do this at this moment, because there is still a big issue. Not all the runners support the State/Timer API today so this will limit the use of this IO to only the runners who do.\r\n\r\nI think we should create a new independent JIRA for the use of GroupIntoBatches when most of the runners support both the State/Timer APIs. We can even create a meta-JIRA to cover other IOs that do batches like this, e.g. ElasticSearchIO, another idea would be to include this in a de-facto and abstract manner for the SDF API. WDYT ? I can create the JIRA if you agree.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/303963213/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/303965842","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3220#issuecomment-303965842","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3220","id":303965842,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMzk2NTg0Mg==","user":{"login":"iemejia","id":79476,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79476?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia","html_url":"https://github.com/iemejia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-25T09:29:56Z","updated_at":"2017-05-25T09:44:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@seshadri-cr Another thing that we already discussed in the review of the HIFIO based version of the IO is that the Hive name is inappropriate considering the fact that this IO is used only to access the HCatalog part of Hive.
