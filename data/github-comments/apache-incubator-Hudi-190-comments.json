What do the hudi-spark2-extensions/hudi-spark3-extensions do? What code would these have in the future?\r\n> 2. Users may have spark jobs that depend directly on `hudi-spark` . any impact to these from the changes?\r\n> 3. I feel there are way too many packages now - hudi-spark*, then it depends hudi-spark-common* . Is there a way for us to merge hudi-spark-common into hudi-spark* ?  is the hudi-spark3-common so we can share code across the different 3.x versions? Can you add a README that explains what code should go where going forward\r\n> 4. Any updates to release notes or README?\r\n\r\n1. I did intend to remove the modules but wrongly added. removed now.\r\n2. I did not change hudi-spark module, so it should have no impact on the users.\r\n3. I think the current modules has be in a good shape, if merge code from hudi-spark-common into hudi-spark* or merge code from hudi-spark3-common into hudi-spark3 & spark3.1.x, there would be many duplicate classes, which i think is not an ideal way.\r\n4.
