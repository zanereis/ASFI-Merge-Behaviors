obvious, as values are progressing from low to high values, with no intertwined values from other threads).\r\n\r\nI think the conclusion must be that in general it works as it should, and with quite a good boost on XLS speed, _maybe_ at the cost of a little bit of writing speed on the XLXS side.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/441467440/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/441468657","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metamodel/pull/194#issuecomment-441468657","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/194","id":441468657,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MTQ2ODY1Nw==","user":{"login":"LosD","id":1282832,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODI4MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1282832?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD","html_url":"https://github.com/LosD","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-25T20:07:12Z","updated_at":"2018-11-25T20:07:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"D'oh,

code involved here is a bit complicated in the first place I guess, because it's located in the generic `JdbcDataContext` class which applies to all database types.

I came to think that maybe a safer way to ensure that is if you sort the schema names by length (longest schema name first).

This code will break once there is a new version 4 of Hive, or something like that. So instead of throwing exceptions I think it should use the logic that we consider safest.\r\n * I think it would be nicer to split out the logic into subclasses. We could maybe have a `Hive2QueryRewriter` and a `Hive3QueryRewriter`.\r\n * Most of the functionality of `rewriteQuery` is already existing in super classes. So hopefully we can built these two new subclasses in a way where much less is being overwritten.

To answer this question:\r\n```\r\nThe ElasticSeachRestUpdateCallback#execute(ActionRequest) method is public, but I would like to make it package private, because it contains an Elasticsearch internal class in its method signature and is only meant to be used internally by other classes in the same package. Is this something I can just change or do I have to do some evil trickery?\r\n```\r\nI would say that you can just make it package private. I don't think we should expose this sort of stuff as an API.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/534598512/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/535190325","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metamodel/pull/229#issuecomment-535190325","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/229","id":535190325,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNTE5MDMyNQ==","user":{"login":"kaspersorensen","id":291450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTQ1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/291450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen","html_url":"https://github.com/kaspersorensen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-25T20:06:33Z","updated_at":"2019-09-25T20:06:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Now the build failed :-/","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/535190325/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/535814659","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metamodel/pull/230#issuecomment-535814659","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/230","id":535814659,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNTgxNDY1OQ==","user":{"login":"kaspersorensen","id":291450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTQ1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/291450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen","html_url":"https://github.com/kaspersorensen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-27T06:52:57Z","updated_at":"2019-09-27T06:52:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It would have been nice to have  a small discussion about this change before doing the PR because I feel like there's maybe a few things I would  have liked to do differently:\r\n\r\n* The idea of detecting column type seems general enough that we should have a facility for it as a decorator pattern or such.\r\n* The PR does not do anything to ensure conversion of values to conform with the data types.
