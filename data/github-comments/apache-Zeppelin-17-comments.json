Current rule of paragraph creation is\n1. automatically adds one after execution of last paragraph.\n2. manually inserts between paragraphs.\n\nAnd this patch changes to\n1. automatically adds one, after execution of last paragraph.\n2. manually inserts between paragraphs.\n3. automatically adds one, after saving non empty last paragraph.\n\nI think it could be confusing, if i see a new paragraph created automatically while editing the last paragraph. Another strategy, with less confusing(i think) is, \n1. automatically adds one, after execution of last paragraph.\n2. manually inserts between paragraphs.\n3. automatically adds one, when user starts editing the last paragraph.\n\nI personally prefer the current rule, but what do you guys
