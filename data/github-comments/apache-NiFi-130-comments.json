It looks like there is a method `resetHttpClientBuilder()` that we should call at the beginning of `createSolrClient`, but we also need to ensure we are inside a synchronized block so that two different Solr processors don't alter `HttpClientUtil` at the same time. We can do that by making `createSolrClient` synchronized.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/606110930/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/606132267","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4170#issuecomment-606132267","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4170","id":606132267,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwNjEzMjI2Nw==","user":{"login":"mkazia","id":3633226,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MzMyMjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3633226?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkazia","html_url":"https://github.com/mkazia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkazia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkazia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkazia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkazia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkazia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkazia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkazia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkazia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkazia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-30T17:22:43Z","updated_at":"2020-03-30T17:22:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing this so that I can open a new clean PR with just one commit.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/606132267/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/606341926","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4126#issuecomment-606341926","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4126","id":606341926,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwNjM0MTkyNg==","user":{"login":"MuazmaZ","id":38145027,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MTQ1MDI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38145027?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuazmaZ","html_url":"https://github.com/MuazmaZ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuazmaZ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuazmaZ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuazmaZ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuazmaZ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuazmaZ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuazmaZ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuazmaZ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuazmaZ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuazmaZ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-31T01:25:40Z","updated_at":"2020-03-31T01:25:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@turcsanyip confirmed with the SDK team that getDirectoryClient(“”) is valid.

In the case of `select *, 'red' AS color from FLOWFILE`, the type of the `color` ends up being char with a length of 3.

However, I just want to reiterate so there is no confusion. Technically, we already do what you just suggested. If it is anonymous, we need to authorize it as such. This is the case today. The intent of this JIRA/PR was to disable default anonymous authentication. In other words, when the incoming request contains no attempted authentication the user becomes the anonymous user. This PR changes that to be disabled by default. The NiFi admin would need to opt in to this behavior.\r\n\r\nThe case I'm highlighting right now is when the incoming request is proxied by a trusted source. In this scenario, the request is authenticated and authorized. It just happens that the end-user is anonymous. So in that way, it differs from the original intent here. However, I believe this would be the expected behavior when the NiFi admin sets this new property.

Our position is that unlike an external ZK cluster which may have many different clients, the embedded ZK instance should only listen on the HTTPS port if the admin configures that, as NiFi will only attempt to connect on that port, and listening on HTTP has the potential to expose sensitive information. However, this is different from normal ZK behavior and therefore we listed some potential approaches to reduce confusion. More details are available in [this comment](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-7203?focusedCommentId=17083557&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-17083557), but I would like to hear your perspective on this.

Specifically the test uses `facet.range.start=NOW/MINUTE` and `facet.range.end=NOW/MINUTE+1MINUTE`.\r\n\r\nThat range condition can be fail if the minutes when the processor executes the query, and the date field value are different. That can be happen by a long GC pause or in an extremely bad timing.\r\nFor example, if `createSolrClient()` method creates the doc at `10:23:59.999`, and the query is executed at `10:24:001`, then the facet range would be `10:24 to 10:25` which does not query documents created at `10:23`.\r\n\r\nI was able to reproduce the assertion error by addint `Thread.sleep(60_000)` at the `testAllFacet Categories` method between it creates `solorClient` and `runner.run`.\r\n\r\nSince the test does not have to filter documents by date range, we can make the range wider (cannot remove the range as Solr requires it). I suggest changing the facet range as follows:\r\n```\r\n        runner.setProperty(\"facet.range.start\", \"NOW/MINUTE-3MINUTE\");\r\n        runner.setProperty(\"facet.range.end\", \"NOW/MINUTE+3MINUTE\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis makes the test passing even with sleeping 1 minute between doc creation and query execution.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/614473511/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/614604897","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4201#issuecomment-614604897","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4201","id":614604897,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxNDYwNDg5Nw==","user":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-16T11:51:55Z","updated_at":"2020-04-16T11:51:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @ijokarumawak!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/614604897/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/614760704","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4204#issuecomment-614760704","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4204","id":614760704,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxNDc2MDcwNA==","user":{"login":"MikeThomsen","id":108184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODE4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeThomsen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-16T16:34:00Z","updated_at":"2020-04-16T16:34:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mattyb149 thanks for the feedback.
