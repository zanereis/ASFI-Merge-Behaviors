Iceberg itself implements the SparkWrite#abort method and could delete datafile with uncatched `java.lang.Error` or `java.lang.Exception`.  ` RuntimeException` can not cover`OutOfMemoryError` , so I did catch all `java.lang.Throwable` to avoid clean-up live data files.

Impala uses Iceberg's HiveCatalog and HadoopFileIO instance with an S3A input stream to access data from S3. We did a full 10 TB TPC-DS benchmark and found that query compilation can go for several seconds, while it used to be less than a second with native hive tables. This slowness in single query compilation is due to the requirement to call planFiles several times, even for scan nodes targetting the same table. We also see several socket read operations that spend hundreds of milliseconds during planFiles, presumably due to S3A HTTP HEAD request overhead and backward seek overhead (issue #4508). This is especially hurt fast-running queries.\r\n\r\nWe tried this caching solution and it help speed up Impala query compilation almost 5x faster compared to without on Iceberg tables. Our original solution, however, is to put a Caffeine cache as a singleton in AvroIO.java. I thought it is better to supply the cache from outside.\r\n\r\nI have not considered the solution of adding a caching FileIO instance. I'm pretty new to the Iceberg codebase but interested to follow up on that if it can yield a better integration. Will it require a new class of Catalog/Table as well, or can we improve on the existing HiveCatalog & HadoopFileIO?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1095389667/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1095393793","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4518#issuecomment-1095393793","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4518","id":1095393793,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85BSmIB","user":{"login":"rizaon","id":6033430,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMzM0MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6033430?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rizaon","html_url":"https://github.com/rizaon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rizaon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rizaon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rizaon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rizaon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rizaon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rizaon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rizaon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rizaon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rizaon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-11T18:18:45Z","updated_at":"2022-04-11T18:18:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"A relevant Impala's JIRA is here:\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IMPALA-11171","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1095393793/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1095405864","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4518#issuecomment-1095405864","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4518","id":1095405864,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85BSpEo","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-11T18:29:07Z","updated_at":"2022-04-11T18:29:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rizaon, caching in the FileIO layer would be much more general.

I believe whenever iceberg is used as a library, iceberg-api and iceberg-core will both be dependent upon. So I wouldn't believe introducing Jackson in the API module will (additionally) pollute downstream dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf we take the java primitive approach, I think my current code could be adapted this way:\r\n\r\nMaintain the current json validation logic, then add a `ValueParser` with `toJson` and `fromJson` to convert between json and their respective java primitive representations.

The original plan was to provide an overloaded `appendsBetween` with `long` and `Long`. But during implementation, I found that overload caused compiling error as I mentioned in one of the comments. So I have to rename the new method to `appendsInRange`, which unfortunately is not as good a name as `appendsBetween`. This PR is actually relatively small change even though it touched many files.\r\n\r\nRegarding special value, I am not sure if there is a special invalid snapshot id that Iceberg reserves in the table format spec. The only special value is `null`.

Hopefully this will make things a bit more straightforward. (So using ResolvedSchema and LogicalSchema  vs just Schema, things like that).\r\n\r\nIm opening a PR to support Flink 1.15 tomorrow (the release candidate anyway). It’s just a port with the minimum required changes to make it work. And then the process of upgrading to the newer APIs can begin.\r\n\r\nHowever, there’s one test case somewhat in this realm (change data capture) that isn’t passing in the 1.15 rc0. I’ll tag you and hopefully if you have time you can take a look? I’d greatly appreciate it.\r\n\r\nAlso feel free to reach out on Slack.

propose another way to solve this for Hive (I'm not sure if this is an issue for other engines, or if they even serialize the tasks the same way a Tez AM does in Hive ecosystem..)\r\n\r\nAs @rdblue mentioned, the expression that goes with the file scan tasks is actually not a \"residual\" one, but rather the original data filter. This is good for us, as now we know that for any Hive job the expression is the same object - so we can transfer it another way to Hive execution processes:\r\n\r\n- The expression itself is generated via https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/master/mr/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/mr/hive/HiveIcebergInputFormat.java#L82-L93 before split generation within the AM. There's nothing to prevent us from reusing this same logic on the executors.\r\n- At the same time we can ask ignoreResiduals() on the table scan, so that Iceberg only uses the filter for split generation, but won't actually attach it to the file scan tasks, and therefore their enwrapping splits.\r\n- On the execution side we can just simply retrieve the original filter expression by the logic above and evaluate it against the current task (whose spec and partition value information are present anyway), ending up with the actual residual expression for the task. This is then passed to the underlying file formats the same way as before.\r\n\r\nI've opened a PR for this in the Hive repo for now: https://github.com/apache/hive/pull/3203\r\nIt looks like there will be some bigger refactors required to separate MR and Hive related stuff in the MR module in the Iceberg repo before this solution could be ported here too.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1096818564/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1096877673","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2105#issuecomment-1096877673","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2105","id":1096877673,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85BYQZp","user":{"login":"klam-shop","id":78921373,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4OTIxMzcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/78921373?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/klam-shop","html_url":"https://github.com/klam-shop","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klam-shop/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klam-shop/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klam-shop/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klam-shop/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klam-shop/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klam-shop/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klam-shop/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klam-shop/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klam-shop/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-12T15:29:06Z","updated_at":"2022-04-12T15:29:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"👋 Is work still ongoing for the FLIP-27 IceBerg Flink source?

This expression hangs on every baseFileScanTask.residuals.expr in its original form i.e. un-evaluated against partition info. (This actually makes it less of a \"residual\" so to speak.)\r\nIf the expression is big and we have thousands of splits, this leads to OOM at the point where every split is getting serialized. (A limitation of TezAM is that streamed serialization is not possible..)\r\nOn the executors, after deserialization we have these baseFileScanTasks along with the original filter expressions which get evaluated against the partition value of the task when we call task.residual(), and thus it becomes an actual \"residual\" expression to be pushed down to file format libs.\r\n\r\nSo far this is how it works currently.\r\n\r\nMy proposal is that since the expressions that get serialized into the splits are always all the same for a given job, Hive should call ignoreResiduals() to make Iceberg set Expressions.alwaysTrue() in the baseFileScanTask instances. Therefore we don't serialize the original filter expressions into every split. We can do this, because the original filter can be retrieved from the Hive job conf anyway. Then with a little trick on the executor processes, we won't take task.residual(), but instead look for the original filter in the job conf, evaluate it according to the current task (spec and partition), and pass the resulting real residual filter to file formats/record readers.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1096956287/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1097040456","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2105#issuecomment-1097040456","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2105","id":1097040456,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85BY4JI","user":{"login":"stevenzwu","id":1545663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDU2NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1545663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu","html_url":"https://github.com/stevenzwu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-12T18:15:03Z","updated_at":"2022-04-12T18:15:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@klam-shop yes, The uber draft PR is meant for the full context for how things work together.
