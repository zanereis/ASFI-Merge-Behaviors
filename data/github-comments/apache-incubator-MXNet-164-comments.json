PooledStorage with new executor won't work. The reason of memory increasing is the memory allocated by new executor using PooledStorage can't be released, and  can't be reused for the future executors.

input data is a tensor containing several video frames with the shape (batch_size, frame_per_video, 3, 224, 224). Then, I use ResNet152 to extract each frame's feature and utilize a temporal fusion method to get a single feature representation for each video. Now, the tensor with the shape (batch_size, feat_dim) will be feed into your LSoftmax operator. The code is like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndata = mx.sym.Variable('data') # shape = (batch_size, frame_per_video, 3, 224, 224)\r\nlabel = mx.sym.Variable('label') # shape = (batch_size,)\r\n# ...\r\n# ResNet152 and temporal fusion\r\n# ...\r\nvideo_feat = ... # shape=(batch_size, feat_dim)\r\nvideo_clf = mx.symbol.LSoftmax(data=video_feat, label=label, num_hidden=num_classes, margin=2, scale=0.99, beta=200, beta_min=0, verbose=True)\r\nvideo_prob = mx.sym.SoftmaxOutput(data=frame_clf, label=label, name='video_prob')\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not sure if it is all right to allow `req[lsoftmax_enum::kDataNorm]== kNullOp` in your implementation. But you can find similar code in mxnet's bn operator(line 98, 99).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/281553214/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/281553883","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/4365#issuecomment-281553883","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/4365","id":281553883,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MTU1Mzg4Mw==","user":{"login":"lji72","id":8282003,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyODIwMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8282003?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lji72","html_url":"https://github.com/lji72","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lji72/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lji72/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lji72/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lji72/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lji72/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lji72/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lji72/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lji72/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lji72/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-22T02:57:27Z","updated_at":"2017-02-22T02:57:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@fanlu @xinghedyc To solve it, you just provide the init_states values which are zeros. and https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/issues/5047","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/281553883/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/281554871","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/5083#issuecomment-281554871","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/5083","id":281554871,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MTU1NDg3MQ==","user":{"login":"luoyetx","id":2768843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3Njg4NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2768843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyetx","html_url":"https://github.com/luoyetx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyetx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyetx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyetx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyetx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyetx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyetx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyetx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyetx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyetx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-22T03:03:56Z","updated_at":"2017-02-22T03:03:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It seems OK to let `req[lsoftmax_enum::kDataNorm]== kNullOp` as the graph already allocate memory for the output.

To avoid such problems it is necessary to use locale independent functions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/281578754/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/281579082","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/5056#issuecomment-281579082","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/5056","id":281579082,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MTU3OTA4Mg==","user":{"login":"piiswrong","id":568948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODk0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong","html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-22T06:10:37Z","updated_at":"2017-02-22T06:10:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"is int('3.3') locale dependent in python?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/281579082/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/281579526","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/5094#issuecomment-281579526","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/5094","id":281579526,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MTU3OTUyNg==","user":{"login":"sampathchanda","id":16012004,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDEyMDA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16012004?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sampathchanda","html_url":"https://github.com/sampathchanda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sampathchanda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sampathchanda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sampathchanda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sampathchanda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sampathchanda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sampathchanda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sampathchanda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sampathchanda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sampathchanda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-22T06:13:57Z","updated_at":"2017-02-22T06:13:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@qiyuangong Thanks for the reply.\r\n\r\nI have actually been trying out multiple AWS AMIs (on Amazon Linux), both from community AMIs and the ones that I made, after installing MXNET with latest source code from GitHub, using installation steps provided on the website. The one I posted above is from the deeplearning.template which is linked from the mxnet repository.\r\n\r\nWhen I installed MXNET from scratch on AWS CPU instance (t2.micro/t2.medium) with Amazon Linux, it is not even starting the training at all. (Nothing being printed) when the following command is launched:\r\n`../../tools/launch.py -n 2 -H hosts python train_mnist.py --kv-store dist_sync`\r\n\r\nAlso, while installing, I made sure that USE_CUDA=0 and also USE_DIST_KVSTORE=1 (used for distributed training). In fact, I have used the script at $MXNET_HOME/setup-utils/install-mxnet-amz-linux.sh\r\n\r\nFollowing are the options being populated into my config.mk from my installation script:\r\n`echo \"USE_CUDA=0\" >>config.mk`\r\n`echo \"USE_CUDNN=0\" >>config.mk`\r\n`echo \"USE_BLAS=openblas\" >>config.mk`\r\n`echo \"USE_DIST_KVSTORE=1\" >>config.mk`\r\n`echo \"ADD_CFLAGS += -I/usr/include/openblas\" >>config.mk`\r\n`echo \"ADD_LDFLAGS += -lopencv_core -lopencv_imgproc -lopencv_imgcodecs\" >>config.mk`\r\n\r\nWhen you said that you tried out distributed training on multi CPU cluster using MXNET, can you please share more details like --\r\n1. What kind of nodes you used? If AWS instances, what type of instances?\r\n2. Did you use Amazon Linux or Ubuntu as OS ?\r\n3. Any specific version of MXNET ? or the latest one available?\r\n\r\nSince I have been using the standard installation script for AWS Linux, I am not sure, what could probably be going wrong now. With the training not even starting or no log being printed, I am not sure how to debug even.

\r\n\r\nMay be it gets stuck when downloading data file (22 MB). This url is always unreachable in my env. I suggest download data files and load locally in `train_mnist.py` (need to modify this script).\r\n\r\nHere are the details about our env:\r\n1. **Ubuntu 16.04 or Centos 7**. Personally, I suggest Ubuntu nodes on VMs (you can launch multiple nodes with Virtual Box, which is free).\r\n2. **Client with Python and MXNet installed**, and MXNet source code in `$HOME$`. So we can use `launch.py` to submit tasks. \r\n3. **SSH no login is configured for remote nodes**. (I am not sure if this step is necessary)\r\n4. **MXNet is not necessary on remote nodes when using `--sync-dst-dir`, but the dependencies are necessary. Because you can sync `mxnet/python/mxnet` (python interface)  and `libmxnet.so` to remote nodes.** Check it in [Run MXNet on Multiple CPU/GPUs with Data Parallel](http://mxnet.io/how_to/multi_devices.html).\r\n5. **New a dir (e.g., `/tmp/mxnet`) on remote nodes**, if you want to use `--sync-dst-dir`.\r\n6.  We put all data files in single dir (`$Home$/train_mnist`) like this:\r\n-----`__init__.py` (empty)\r\n------`mxnet` (from mxnet/python/mxnet)\r\n---------`libmxnet.so` (build from src)\r\n------`train_mnist.py`\r\n------`hosts`\r\n------`common` (from example/image-classification/common)\r\n------`symbols` (from example/image-classification/symbols)\r\n------date files (t10k-images.......)\r\n7. We use the following cmd:\r\n`../mxnet/tools/launch.py -n 2 -H hosts --sync-dst-dir /tmp/mxnet python train_mnist.py --kv-store dist_sync`\r\n\r\nIn this case, MXNet will sync the train_mnist dir (with data files) to all remote nodes (/tmp/mxnet). Then launch the training command.\r\n\r\nYour command is also valid, but you need to install MXNet on each node, and make sure your network is fine (for both client and nodes).

This design is problematic in relation to the MakeLoss function.  MakeLoss causes the output of the network to be the loss value, but all of the built in output layers output the last layer of the net and silently compute the gradient respect to the loss on the backward pass. \r\n\r\nI also second forcecore's question above.  The multiple output example is confusing.  The example should expanded to understand how loss is computed when using multiple outputs.  If I use Makeloss, can one output be the loss and the other be the final layer?  Otherwise how is one expected to access the final layer for making predictions?\r\n\r\nOverall, what is the proper way to define a custom loss in the mxnet framework.  Is it to define a custom operator that outputs the final layer on the forward pass, but computes the gradient with respect to a loss function on the backward pass?  If so, how would one plot the loss overtime during training?\r\n\r\nThanks for taking the time to explain your design.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/281804283/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/281810758","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/5095#issuecomment-281810758","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/5095","id":281810758,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MTgxMDc1OA==","user":{"login":"freddycct","id":1184555,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODQ1NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1184555?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/freddycct","html_url":"https://github.com/freddycct","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freddycct/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freddycct/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freddycct/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freddycct/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freddycct/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freddycct/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freddycct/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freddycct/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freddycct/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-22T21:31:58Z","updated_at":"2017-02-22T21:31:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"there's definitely a bug, i am debugging and will submit a PR later.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/281810758/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
