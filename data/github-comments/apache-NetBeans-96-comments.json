I think I would prefer if the changes would be done in one step, unless it is very difficult to do so.\r\n\r\nI thought about this a lot while writing jackpot scripts in past (I uploaded some general purpose ones here: https://github.com/mbien/jackpot-inspections). At first I tried to maintain \"shortcuts\" which attempted to refactor everything in one step, but quickly saw that this would let the rule count explode. A shortcut is also only a single path from a specific bad code pattern to clean code, there are more creative ways of bad code than there can be shortcut rules - finding them all is a bit hopeless.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, experience shows from refactoring multiple projects from old java to new java that rules interact in fairly unpredictable ways. I always apply the same set of rules twice, since the second time will usually find something new if the project is large enough - its not really possible to account for that in a shortcut rule.\r\n\r\n(Maybe its worth investigating if there would be a way to automatically merge rules. If a rule triggers, it could check if the refactoring would trigger another one.)\r\n\r\nBut back to this concrete PR. The problem here was that the rules were all over the place. There are autoboxing rules in Tiny and also several in the jdk package.  There were gaps, some overlapped and some were not correct (as noticed in https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/3221). Its probably worth to move everything into one package and see after that if some steps could be left out somehow by merging rules (but this would be a different PR).\r\n\r\n> \r\n> Thanks for working on this!\r\n\r\nno problem","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1003738718/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1003914909","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/3385#issuecomment-1003914909","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/3385","id":1003914909,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M471oad","user":{"login":"MKuettner","id":72084885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyMDg0ODg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72084885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MKuettner","html_url":"https://github.com/MKuettner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MKuettner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MKuettner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MKuettner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MKuettner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MKuettner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MKuettner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MKuettner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MKuettner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MKuettner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-03T07:40:23Z","updated_at":"2022-01-03T07:40:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@matthiasblaesing:  I tested your changes with the Python LSP and it seems to works fine (it looks much better than before).\r\nIt would be nice if you could create an own PR and merge it independently.
