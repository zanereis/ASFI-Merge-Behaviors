But If we want provide some backward compatibility that’s what we should figure out.How to fix it? the user should set OAP instance to use UTC that should be well documented for upgrading.\n\nFor service mesh, eg. istio mixer,envoy, there’s no chance to grab timezone of senders. But a good news for us is they are both deployed in docker whose default timezone is UTC, especially envoy’s access log is [designed to support it](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/3546 <https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/3546>).So the details should be declared in our documents.\n\n\n\n> On Apr 30, 2019, at 9:39 AM, 吴晟 Wu Sheng <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n> \n> So we should document it well.
