The idea is very simple - make sure the declared methods go first (so the methods that are declared by the class itself are checked first). Before processing, the methods are ordered by declaring class:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        List<Method> methods = Arrays.asList(tclass.getMethods());\r\n        Collections.sort(methods, (m1, m2) -> {\r\n            if (m1.getDeclaringClass().equals(m2.getDeclaringClass())) {\r\n                return 0;\r\n            } else if (m1.getDeclaringClass().equals(tclass)) {\r\n                return -1;\r\n            } else {\r\n                return 1;\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have to contradict myself (the `Beanspector` introspection should not depend on order, this was my first impression but it turned out to be trickier) but there is a high risk to break existing application by changing this logic. My apologies for side tracking you - it is essentially your initial idea to involve `getDeclatedMethod()` but a bit simplified from implementation standpoint.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/2040643978/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/2040684505","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cxf/pull/1784#issuecomment-2040684505","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/1784","id":2040684505,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQMOR855ol_Z","user":{"login":"jgoodyear","id":402721,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjcyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/402721?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgoodyear","html_url":"https://github.com/jgoodyear","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgoodyear/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgoodyear/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgoodyear/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgoodyear/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgoodyear/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgoodyear/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgoodyear/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgoodyear/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgoodyear/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-05T22:00:43Z","updated_at":"2024-04-05T22:00:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Doing declared methods first works for me - i had originally flagged for IBM Java just to limit any potential impacts a deeper change could have to existing applications.
