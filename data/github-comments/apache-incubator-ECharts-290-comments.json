@susiwen8 Thanks for your fixing.\r\nI've been inspired by following code lines from @Ovilia ~\r\nMaybe we can make some changes like this\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-echarts/blob/5a94212c43f0a4b5a8da7c26cf20192d29fb1d02/src/component/tooltip/TooltipRichContent.js#L139-L147\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, there may be no need to solve this issue as present scheme.\r\n```js\r\nvar textRect = textContain.getBoundingRect(text, font, null, null, null, labelModel.get('lineHeight'));\r\n```\r\n\r\nSome changes are as follows\r\n```js\r\nstyle: graphic.setTextStyle({}, labelModel, {\r\n    text: text,\r\n    fill: bgColor,\r\n    stroke: labelModel.get('borderColor') || 'transparent',\r\n    lineWidth: labelModel.get('borderWidth') || 0,\r\n    textFont: font,\r\n    textPosition: 'inside',\r\n    textPadding: paddings,\r\n    textFill: labelModel.getTextColor()\r\n})\r\n```\r\nThis can solve the issue that `lineHeight` is invalid and in the meanwhile, there are more supported properties of label.(Note that some new supported properties are now missing description in the official document)\r\n```js\r\nlabel: {\r\n    fontWeight: 'bold',\r\n    fontSize: 20,\r\n    textShadowBlur: 10,\r\n    textShadowOffsetX: 10,\r\n    textShadowOffsetY: 10,\r\n    textShadowColor: 'red',\r\n    backgroundColor: 'yellow',\r\n    textBorderColor: 'blue',\r\n    textBorderWidth: 5,\r\n    borderWidth: 2,\r\n    borderColor: 'cyan',\r\n    padding: [10, 20, 30, 40],\r\n    shadowColor:
