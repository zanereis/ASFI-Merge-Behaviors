Good improvement. I made a few comments-in line.\r\n\r\nOne part that I am not sure if it is worth starting two transactions per task item just to compute version stamps and maybe a few other fields. That seems quite expensive if, say, someone is polling status on a cluster with hundreds of tasks, given that jobs already have the dbs open and all that data available to start with. The reason we decided to do that was to ensure we are below 100KB for JobData, I think?\r\n\r\nWe'd have to make a convincing case that our active_jobs status section in each JobData would have a chance of pushing it over the 100KB value limit. I tried encoding a large-ish object similar to the one we are adding for the task status:\r\n\r\n```\r\nS = #{\r\n    <<\"database\">> => << <<\"x\">> || _ <- lists:seq(1,256) >>,\r\n    <<\"changes_done\">> => 999999999999999999999999999999,\r\n    <<\"design_document\">> => << <<\"d\">> || _ <- lists:seq(1,512) >>,\r\n    <<\"current_version_stamp\">> => <<\"1111111111111111111111111111111111111111\">>,\r\n    <<\"db_version_stamp\">> => <<\"222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222\">>\r\n}.\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n>> size(iolist_to_binary(jiffy:encode(S))).\r\n984\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo we'd be adding at most another 1KB (in the worst case) to get closer to the 100KB limit if we save the status in the job data that doesn't seem that bad perhaps and it would simplify the design quite a bit more.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/662529977/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/662550336","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/3024#issuecomment-662550336","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/3024","id":662550336,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2MjU1MDMzNg==","user":{"login":"rnewson","id":47223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson","html_url":"https://github.com/rnewson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-22T16:21:39Z","updated_at":"2020-07-22T16:22:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"With this feature, we can add aegis support with an encode_fun like this;\r\n\r\n```\r\n    EncodeFun = fun\r\n        (encode, Key, Term) ->\r\n            Bin = term_to_binary(Term, [compressed, {minor_version, 2}]),\r\n            aegis:encrypt(TxDb, Key, Bin);\r\n        (decode, Key, Ciphertext) ->\r\n            Bin = aegis:decrypt(TxDb, Key, Ciphertext),\r\n            binary_to_term(Bin, [safe])\r\n    end.\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/662550336/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/662552156","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/3003#issuecomment-662552156","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/3003","id":662552156,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2MjU1MjE1Ng==","user":{"login":"davisp","id":19929,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19929?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp","html_url":"https://github.com/davisp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-22T16:25:01Z","updated_at":"2020-07-22T16:25:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I'm actually counting three possible transactions between opening the database if its not in cache, one for the reading the design doc, then one for the other two bits of info.\r\n\r\nCan someone point me to the discussion where we decided to move away from storing active task info in the job state?

The first items claim to \"store the reduce results\" is misleading to the casual reader as, without something like ebtree and its storage of data on inner nodes, it's not possible to calculate useful intermediation reductions. What I think you're doing is reducing the k-v's emitted by a single document? If so, that is not something that CouchDB has done to date and seems to have limited value, certainly in the common case that a map function emits one row per document.\r\n\r\n> A simple design that uses less space over all would be to insert the emitted keys and values directly into ebtree and pass in a reducer function that calculates each of the desired reductions specified, and store those in a tuple or a map. couch_views can then call ebtree's functions for lookup (?key=), ranges (for ?startkey=X&endkey=Y&reduce=false) and the various reduce functions as needed (group=true, group_level=X, reduce=true). This ensures we only store each distinct thing once and the logic gets much simpler.\r\n\r\nI'm currently doing this, if a document emits the following from a map function:\r\n```\r\n([1, 1], 1)\r\n([1, 1], 2)\r\n([3, 3], 1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen the reduce results for a `_sum` would be:\r\n```\r\n([1, 1], 3)\r\n([3, 3], 1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would then store those values like this in ebtree\r\n\r\n```\r\n(([1, 1], doc_id), (KVSize, 3))\r\n(([3, 3], doc_id), (KVSize, 1))\r\n```\r\n\r\nI know this is different to how CouchDB had done in the previously. But I don't see what we would gain from storing the map index a second time. Querying the current map index should be faster than reading from the b-tree since we can do a range scan of the map index. I'm really not comfortable using ebtree for the map index. We would need to determine how performant it would be to do that and what advantages we would get. I would really like to keep ebtree just for the reduce part. I'm very cautious on the idea of using it outside of that. I think if we start loosing a lot of the functionality we get with FDB. \r\n\r\n>Finally, on insertion generally, if it's possible to do even a small amount of batching we'll reap considerable performance rewards. For the case where we update the view atomically with the document, obviously that can't happen, but for new indexes it would be good if we would update 10 or 20 documents per fdb txn that involves an ebtree. Insert performance would be approximately 10x / 20x faster.\r\n\r\nThis is already done in `couch_views_indexer`.
