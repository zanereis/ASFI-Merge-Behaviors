PR is initially for discussion about how to proceed. As I mentioned more work is needed, that I can purse, if we agree to go this route. That work will of course need to include updated to docs like DEVELOPMENT.md  and also .travis.yml.\n\nThis PR is not against the gradle branch. I started fresh from master as I felt that if we move to a gradle build, we should do things the gradle way (e.g. jars in build/libs) rather than just replace ant with gradle and continue to use the ant builds places for class file, jar files, etc. One of the points of having a gradle build is that gradle knowledgeable engineers can understand the build quickly. Having non-standard places for outputs go against that. \n\nThis branch can be merged to master with no affect on the ant build since this gradle build puts it output in gradle standard places which are different than the places the ant build uses. So we could merge this into master and then continue to improve the gradle build while the ant build continues to function. Then when the gradle build is at functional parity, we can remove the ant build.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-retired-edgent/issues/comments/224719089/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-retired-edgent/issues/comments/224720047","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-retired-edgent/pull/131#issuecomment-224720047","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-retired-edgent/issues/131","id":224720047,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNDcyMDA0Nw==","user":{"login":"ddebrunner","id":3769612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3Njk2MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3769612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddebrunner","html_url":"https://github.com/ddebrunner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddebrunner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddebrunner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddebrunner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddebrunner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddebrunner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddebrunner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddebrunner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddebrunner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddebrunner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-08T20:39:03Z","updated_at":"2016-06-08T20:39:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bjhargrave FYI - the convention is to prefix the pull request with `[WIP]` to indicate work-in-progress\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-retired-edgent/issues/comments/224720047/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-retired-edgent/issues/comments/224720270","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-retired-edgent/pull/131#issuecomment-224720270","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-retired-edgent/issues/131","id":224720270,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNDcyMDI3MA==","user":{"login":"bjhargrave","id":277682,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NzY4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/277682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjhargrave","html_url":"https://github.com/bjhargrave","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjhargrave/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjhargrave/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjhargrave/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjhargrave/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjhargrave/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjhargrave/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjhargrave/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjhargrave/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjhargrave/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-08T20:39:49Z","updated_at":"2016-06-08T20:39:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @bjhargrave FYI - the convention is to prefix the pull request with [WIP] to indicate work-in-progress\n\nFixed.
