I don't know the heritage of graaljs, but either the team that build it and the NetBeans team were close or even two intersecting groups. It looks as if at some point the original graaljs parser was used in NetBeans to build the AST of the language, but then development in the JS area of NetBeans slowed while graaljs was further progressing and the to versions drifted apart. Today there are two versions of graaljs: The original one used in graalvm and the netbeans fork Jaroslav Tulach kindly created to get the NetBeans fork onto a usable license, which I took and added the necessary parser features for es.next.
