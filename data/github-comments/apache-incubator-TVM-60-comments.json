This would allow an incredibly minimal interpreter (O(10kb) of object code, since it's basically just doing malloc + dlopen + dlsym) which is very useful for certain code-size-constrained CV applications in embedded systems.\r\n\r\n2) More complex interpreter with support for dynamic allocation. This you can imagine as something that's used underneath the existing APIs of various platform `{mxnet,c2,tf}::Predictor` objects (e.g. https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/scala-package/infer/src/main/scala/org/apache/mxnet/infer/Predictor.scala, https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/amalgamation/python/mxnet_predict.py, https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/predictor, https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/caffe2/predictor/predictor.h, etc). This would probably need to support dynamic memory allocation (as e.g. input dimensions like batch sizes may be different from invocation to invocation), possibly JIT-specializing to different shapes at runtime, etc.  Another possible usage model could be as a backend for e.g. https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/tree/master/torch/csrc/jit/fuser which would introduce some more constraints.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/439559496/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/439565315","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/2122#issuecomment-439565315","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2122","id":439565315,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzOTU2NTMxNQ==","user":{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-17T00:04:59Z","updated_at":"2018-11-17T00:04:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Is

In a word, just dump data anywhere in global memory is fine, do not waste time concatenating them, reordering them or moving them around before they are actually needed in real computation. For example, in `concat`, can we avoid memory allocation, kernel launching, etc, which just move data to somewhere, even if there is no actual computation? We could maintain discontiguous memory chunks lazily, and only indexing them when real computation happens. Although memory access cost in this kernel is possibly increased, it does eliminate overall memory accesses. I guess this could be implemented by an extra pass.\r\n2) Dynamic batching. If 1) is enabled, dynamic batching could be realized very easily. I do believe dynamic batching will be a nice feature so that NLPers could focus on the model itself rather than batching data, while get performance gain automatically. I think we have some usecases in industry  as well @yidawang .\r\n3) Fine-grained streaming. It is possible to stream data on CUDA GPU, but kind of complicated. We do hear about usecases when doing heterogeneous FPGA-CUDA acceleration, streaming row by row from GPU to FPGA helps a lot in reducing latency to nearly zero.\r\n4) The ability to get rid of a runtime, i.e. pure AOT. Having a heavy runtime is repeating the mistakes of previous generation of deep learning framework. What's more, any extra dependency means extra plain on edge devices. I think it could be great to just dump a binary which allows us to call a subset of computation (which contains no control flow, only dataflow), and let users themselves assemble these binarized when containing branches, loops etc.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/439581161/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/439581496","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/2122#issuecomment-439581496","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2122","id":439581496,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzOTU4MTQ5Ng==","user":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-17T02:43:16Z","updated_at":"2018-11-17T02:43:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I agree with @szha that we should have a scope of discussion.

seems that the boundary checking is introduced by the following code snippet, which I don't quite understand.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/c5e1da936a4b583a957c3f325aea0da36aeaf8d3/src/schedule/message_passing.cc#L490-L499\r\n\r\nThe logic here is: (let `iv` be a IterVar, e.g. `lstm_scan.idx`)\r\n1) Let `value = iv - min(iv)`.\r\n2) Let `vmin = min(value)`, and `vmax = max(value)`.\r\n3) Add boundary checks for `value >= 0`  ===> `iv >= min(iv)` if line 494 is true.\r\n4) Add boundary checks for `value + min(iv) < extend(iv)` ===> `iv >= extend(iv)` if line 497 is true.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 things I think weird\r\n1) The first boundary check, i.e. `iv >= min(iv)`, should be likely to be true. It should be the main cause of the issue in this thread. But I found that it was introduced by PR #1091 which fixes Issue #1014. I will spend some time looking into it.\r\n2) The second boundary check, i.e. `iv >= extend(iv)`, seems to compare a concrete var to its extent, which does not make sense to me.\r\n\r\nLet's take `iv = iter_var(lstm_scan.idx, Range(min=1, extent=(num_step - 1)))` as an example. Here\r\n1) `iv->dom = range(min=1, ext=(num_step - 1))`\r\n2) `value = lstm_scan.idx`\r\n3) `vmin = 0`, and `vmax = num_step`\r\n\r\nSo it automatically inserts a predicate `lstm_scan.idx >= 0` in line 495 (which causes aforementioned issue), and skips line 498.\r\n\r\nPing @tqchen @were if you are interested.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/439659006/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/439671853","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/2088#issuecomment-439671853","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2088","id":439671853,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzOTY3MTg1Mw==","user":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-18T06:48:54Z","updated_at":"2018-11-18T06:48:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Should
