Would this cause EVERY git commit locally to run full integration tests? I'm not entirely sure yet if that is not too much. At least me I relatively often make small changes, and would want to be able to commit them without having to run full integration tests locally. I'm assuming that the problem you are trying to solve is the failing PRs on GitHub. But the reason for that, IMHO, isn't really that people don't run tests locally - I think they (mostly) do. What's really hurting us is are all the flaky test issues linked from https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FINERACT-850.
