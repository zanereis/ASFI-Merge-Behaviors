I was looking at this with @hsiang-c who is also working with Geo data , we are starting a POC of geo-data on Iceberg.\r\n\r\nWe were reading a previous thread on the subject:  https://lists.apache.org/thread/t6nk5t5j1p302hmcjs77lndm07ssk8cl   , it seems there, @rdblue was thinking an alternative to adding geo-type was to use binary type with WKD encoding.  That way we don't have to add new types to Iceberg.  Also, I noticed that changing partition transform from taking one primitive, to taking a complex type, is probably a bigger change and can be avoided if possible, as it may raise more questions.\r\n\r\nI also agree with the thread that the benefit of Iceberg will be having some geo_partition partition transform, to avoid the user to have to manually generate a partition column.   There's also a few open question for geo_partition transform, as there's several formats , we need to decide which one we support, or my thought to leave it a pluggable implementation.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1672276132/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1672317226","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/8278#issuecomment-1672317226","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/8278","id":1672317226,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85jrYkq","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-09T23:32:51Z","updated_at":"2023-08-09T23:33:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"cc

Overall, I'm not opposed to adding a bom, but I'm not sure if this will be more helpful or confusing. Many projects that depend on iceberg (Flink/Spark/etc.) do not publish a bom and Iceberg will frequently be dropped in. If you build fat job jars, they may pull in transitive dependencies that conflict with the existing libraries. We try to match the upstream dependencies, so maybe it will generally be ok.\r\n\r\nBOMs are useful when multiple dependencies from the same project are needed - to align versions. BOMs are actually good practice IMO.\r\n\r\n\"Fat/uber jars\" do not need BOMs.\r\n\r\n(flame off) Fat/uber jars that contain not-relocated dependencies are a gift that keeps on giving dependency issues - having non-relocated dependencies in a fat/uber jar intended to be used with other dependencies is an absolute no-go IMHO. Fat/uber jars are a relict from the time when the only option was to manually drop a jar somewhere - even Spark has a (rudimentary) dependency resolution mechanism. Beside that, fat/uber jars containing dependencies are way too big.

Disabling column stats filtering would clearly be a bad idea in that use case, even though the planning speed improved.

Right now, we can not change the compression codec for the ManifestFile/ManifestListFile. The default one is GZIP. We have implemented some code to support changes by the write.avro.compression-codec. I could submit a PR for it if it is acceptable.\r\n\r\nYeah, we use `DeflateCodec` by default.
