Looking at the code I could see that the logic for waiting was wrong, so maybe sometimes the test did not wait long enough.\n\nIn the place where the test failed it was attempting to verify the Fluo GC iterator worked correctly.  So if there is a problem, its with garbage collection not cleaning up everything it should.

The problem this issue is trying to solve is getting good throughput from a source of continuous information that needs feedback on when that information was successfully processed by Fluo.  The LoaderExecutor gives good throughput for committing transactions, but lacks the feedback mechanism.\n\nI was thinking about how to solve  this w/ the current 1.0.0 release.  One way would be to process batches with the loader executor.  For example process 10,000 transactions with the LoaderExecutor and then shut the LoaderExecutor down.  After its shut down, then feedback can be given to the information source that all 10,000 transactions completed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/257617340/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/257678371","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fluo/pull/796#issuecomment-257678371","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/796","id":257678371,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NzY3ODM3MQ==","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-01T20:01:58Z","updated_at":"2016-11-01T20:01:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"May want to document the issues with logback vs log4j when running in Yarn, with some background on this issue.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/257678371/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/257709831","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fluo/pull/796#issuecomment-257709831","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/796","id":257709831,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NzcwOTgzMQ==","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-01T21:51:36Z","updated_at":"2016-11-01T21:51:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"We also need to document that it would be best if observers used slf4j when doing their own logging.

If a caching feature is introduced, the user should have control over the size and lifecycle of the cache, to learn from Accumulo's lessons.\n\nOf the options, I think the short-lived cache is most appealing. But, if it's user-provided, they could selectively re-use the same cache for many operations.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/260815430/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/261365908","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fluo/issues/800#issuecomment-261365908","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/800","id":261365908,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTM2NTkwOA==","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-17T20:52:28Z","updated_at":"2016-11-17T20:52:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"In #804 I did some very narrow caching.
