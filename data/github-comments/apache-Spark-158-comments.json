true @kayousterhout , but my point is that what if all the tasks only specify NODE_LOCAL preference (common case when the RDD is created from some HDFS file)?

I ran into this during the test for the patch.\nIs it possible that we set some time out waiting for new executors to come up? Before the time out, only tasks without preference (if any) in pendingTasksWithNoPrefs can run as PROCESS_LOCAL. After this period, we believe it's unlikely new executors gonna come up, so all tasks in pendingTasksWithNoPrefs can be treated as PROCESS_LOCAL (pendingTasksWithNoPrefs can still be re-computed if new executors do come up later).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/45184290/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/45186138","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/976#issuecomment-45186138","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/976","id":45186138,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MTg2MTM4","user":{"login":"AmplabJenkins","id":4031291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzEyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4031291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/AmplabJenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-06-05T06:47:59Z","updated_at":"2014-06-05T06:47:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":" Merged build triggered. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/45186138/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/45186158","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/974#issuecomment-45186158","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/974","id":45186158,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MTg2MTU4","user":{"login":"AmplabJenkins","id":4031291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzEyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4031291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/AmplabJenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-06-05T06:48:19Z","updated_at":"2014-06-05T06:48:19Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Merged build finished.

revised the patch as @mateiz suggested: tasks will be added to corresponding lists even when preferred location is unavailable, in which case it'll also be added to pendingTasksWithNoPrefs. Later when new executor comes up, pendingTasksWithNoPrefs is re-computed to remove tasks that have available preferred locations.\nI also added a \"waiting for new executor\" period. During that period, tasks in pendingTasksWithNoPrefs will wait until we tried all other locality levels (unless they really have no constraints). After this period, tasks left in pendingTasksWithNoPrefs will be scheduled as PROCESS_LOCAL.\nPlease help to review this,
