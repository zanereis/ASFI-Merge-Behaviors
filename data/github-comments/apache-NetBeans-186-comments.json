Otherwise they also use heavy-weight popups. So this issue also occurs in Metal or GTK Laf if the NB \"document list\" popup does not fit into the NB main window.\r\n\r\n> This change in the JDK looks like it might be a culprit? [openjdk/jdk@3d550f7](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/commit/3d550f748521443dc2e148aa4f786060419f1113)\r\n\r\nYes, this is the cause. I've debugged it.\r\nThe popup `JWindow` gains focus, therefore the main window looses focus and the [popup is hidden](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/commit/3d550f748521443dc2e148aa4f786060419f1113#diff-06394e306da8bd8cd5afb8887820511ffd26a05cbabb6aabedc92301f02f76ddR503-R511). This is a regression in JDK 21.\r\n\r\nSo why do other popups (menu, tooltips, etc) work in NB with Java 21? Because they do not receive focus.\r\n\r\nThe NB \"document list\" popup internally uses a `JTable` and for keyboard navigation is seems that the focus is transferred to the table.\r\n\r\nI'm working on a fix/hack for FlatLaf that removes that bad window focus listener 😒 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1773802287/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1773843015","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/6603#issuecomment-1773843015","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/6603","id":1773843015,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5purJH","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-21T16:13:23Z","updated_at":"2023-10-21T16:13:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"You were in the \"Projects\" view and closed this when you pressed CTRL+W.

Github destroys author information and that is not acceptable from my POV, so I normally use git cli.\r\n\r\nThis might help: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase#_interactive_mode\r\n\r\nBefore doing a rebase with your work branch (`java_registry_read`) I suggest you try it first on a copy of the branch.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1774050490/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1774059644","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/6601#issuecomment-1774059644","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/6601","id":1774059644,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5pvgB8","user":{"login":"vieiro","id":564140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NDE0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/564140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro","html_url":"https://github.com/vieiro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-22T10:45:56Z","updated_at":"2023-10-22T10:45:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It seems the plugin has a manifest version 2, but [Chrome cannot run manifest version2 plugins since January, 2023](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/mv2-transition/).\r\n\r\nSo the plugin should be upgraded to manifest version 3.

I couldn't try on Windows yet, but there's a chance this would happen even without the manual modification on Windows, as the files may be internally marked as modified due to different line endings, or alike. Not sure about that.\r\n\r\nMy understanding  of the cause so far is that files are locked when they are modified, but the lock is not materialized as a file in most cases. But when two files with the same name (not path) are modified, the locks are materialized as files. I was not able to find out what is the reason for this behavior.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1779124256/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1779685219","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/6579#issuecomment-1779685219","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/6579","id":1779685219,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5qE9dj","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-25T16:55:11Z","updated_at":"2023-10-25T17:56:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"rebased.

I tried to do a rebase of this and aborted it as it failed multiple time and the commit count is very high. I think it would be best, if you create a new branch and replicate the changes there manually.\r\n\r\nWhile doing this:\r\n\r\n- ensure that your git client is configured not to mess with line endings (disable `core.autocrlf`), if in doubt line endings follow unix convention, `.bat` and `.cmd`  are the exception (see `.gitattributes`)\r\n- ensure your author information is correct in the git client it should be \"REALNAME <EMAIL>\", this varies in your case. You can check it locally running `git log` in the project folder\r\n- before you commit run `git diff` if the whole file is reported as being changed, line endings were modified. Stop at that point, recheck you settings\r\n- before you open a PR, check the resulting commit git with git log to see if author information is correct\r\n- also check all comments, whether or not the remarks were addressed.

I was about to test the devbuild but will stop since it is not the right branch (assuming it is supposed to go into delivery?).\r\n\r\nI would personally prefer the lowest risk approach and revert (#6623) the changes and prepare a new PR for NB 21 where they have some time to stabilize. For future integrations of non-trivial PRs which have possible risks of side effects, please state what kind of testing has been done before integration (example: #6597, #6533).

Once the instances are in the map, the read operations should be really fast while using synchronization since the critical sections are tiny.\r\n\r\nthe refactoring does also not get rid of many critical sections, e.g:\r\n```\r\n        public boolean isEmpty() {\r\n            synchronized(delegate) {return delegate.isEmpty();}\r\n        }\r\n```\r\nso there would be more work left to finish it.\r\n\r\nI usually would see concurrency updates a bit outside the scope of cleanups. Is it worth spending the extra time in review for risky changes when the access pattern is ending up to be get() after short initialization?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1783881774/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1783898402","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/6458#issuecomment-1783898402","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/6458","id":1783898402,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5qVCEi","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-28T19:00:51Z","updated_at":"2023-10-28T19:00:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"a starting point would be to take a look at the eclipse or intellij keybindings which are here:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/netbeans/blob/master/ide/defaults/src/org/netbeans/modules/defaults/Eclipse-keybindings.xml#L24\r\nand\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/netbeans/blob/master/java/java.editor/src/org/netbeans/modules/java/editor/resources/eclipse-global-keymap.xml#L30\r\n\r\nWe don't really assign issues, you can simply start working on something and open a PR if you have any results.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1783898402/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
