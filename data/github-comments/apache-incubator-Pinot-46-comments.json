Should be pretty straight forward to do that.\r\n\r\n@mayankshriv , thanks for the suggestion. Yes that is what I was doing (after intially trying to put the avro file in a hive table and then updating it via sql). After a brief discussion with @mcvsubbu , we also decided that it will be good to have an option in SegmentGeneratorConfig to enable/disable (if at all needed) this time validity check in segment generation code path. The check is enabled by default and we can see later if realtime code has any surprises in production -- in that case we can disable it. \r\n\r\nSecondly, we also discussed about the changes to failing unit tests. Very few of them were fixed by changing the data generation code. For rest of them, I was in the middle of changing the avro datasets. However, for current PR, I have just explicitly disabled the check for these unit tests that use avro file. I have another patch in progress that cleans up the avro data through a simple java program that updates the records. \r\n\r\nAlso, a unit test has been added to test the exception code in SegmentGenerationWithTimeColumnTest.java","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/506910360/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/507010083","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/4386#issuecomment-507010083","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/4386","id":507010083,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNzAxMDA4Mw==","user":{"login":"kishoreg","id":850791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg","html_url":"https://github.com/kishoreg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-30T05:51:52Z","updated_at":"2019-06-30T05:51:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This is a good feature.

I personally think that's a nice-to-have change and will help to reuse the byte array store code for both mutable and immutable dictionaries.\r\nHowever, @Jackie-Jiang is working on refactoring/cleaning the mutable byte array store related code so #4348 isn't going to be merged soon. Also, @Jackie-Jiang and I discussed that the byte array store used for VariableLength dictionary is different enough from the regular mutable store that it's okay for VarLength dictionary to have it's own immutable bytes store. We can definitely find better optimizations for immutable byte store that may not be applicable for mutable store.\r\nHence, I am now going to work on addressing the review comments on this PR and will get it ready to be merged. @mcvsubbu @Jackie-Jiang Please reply if you guys think otherwise.\r\ncc @kishoreg ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/507135532/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/507658913","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/4332#issuecomment-507658913","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/4332","id":507658913,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNzY1ODkxMw==","user":{"login":"vasilije90","id":35026838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MDI2ODM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35026838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasilije90","html_url":"https://github.com/vasilije90","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasilije90/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasilije90/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasilije90/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasilije90/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasilije90/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasilije90/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasilije90/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasilije90/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasilije90/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-02T12:39:59Z","updated_at":"2019-07-02T12:40:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @akshayrai \r\nI fixed the issue by adding \r\nString fixed_str = groupKeyVal.split(\"\\\\.\")[0];\r\nmillis = DateTime.parse(fixed_str, inputDataDateTimeFormatter).getMillis();\r\nto line 133 in parseResultSets function","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/507658913/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/507850596","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/4321#issuecomment-507850596","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/4321","id":507850596,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNzg1MDU5Ng==","user":{"login":"kishoreg","id":850791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg","html_url":"https://github.com/kishoreg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-02T21:26:00Z","updated_at":"2019-07-02T21:26:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@buchireddy Have you addressed all the comments? @Jackie-Jiang, can you take another look and approve.

The broker emits metrics that track against these numbers. There are no guarantees around this - they are used to obtain overall availability numbers of the service at the desired threshold (ie, 99.999/99.99 etc). The time interval over which the numbers are derived is not dictated by this implementation - its left to the users to derive.

Ingest\r\n- Druid supports two modes Push (Tranquility) and Pull (Kafka Indexing Service). Push has the limitation that late arriving events (after a certain window) will be dropped. I am not sure if the limitation applies to the pull mode.  https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/ingestion/stream-ingestion.html\r\n\r\nPinot support ingesting data from directly from Kafka. We support two modes - using high level Kafka Consumer or low level Kafka consumer. Using low level you can get exactly once semantics. Pinot does not drop late arriving events.\r\n\r\nSegment\r\n- Pinot & Druid have their own custom columnar format to store data. At a high level, a segment contains forward index (mostly dictionary encoded) and inverted index (optional). Pinot has additional indexing schema known as star-tree index which can speed up Aggregations.

So we are migrating to direct metrics reporter that allow us to grab metrics from registry and send to our internal metrics report system. However, our internal metrics system expect a different prefix compared to the one we defined here and it will be great if we can customize the prefix with config\r\n\r\n2. well, anything configurable is better than hard-coded values for flexibility :)\r\n\r\nfor minion we are not really using it, so we are not sure if our change would be correct or not. we could make similar change to minion if you think it is necessary, but it would be a bit hard for us to test it","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/510998605/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/511016818","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/4430#issuecomment-511016818","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/4430","id":511016818,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMTAxNjgxOA==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-12T20:06:38Z","updated_at":"2019-07-13T04:51:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#

So we are migrating to direct metrics reporter that allow us to grab metrics from registry and send to our internal metrics report system. However, our internal metrics system expect a different prefix compared to the one we defined here and it will be great if we can customize the prefix with config\r\n> 2. well, anything configurable is better than hard-coded values for flexibility :)\r\n\r\nNot all the time. It is good to have a product with fewer knobs so a rollout can be faster, and adoption better.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> for minion we are not really using it, so we are not sure if our change would be correct or not. we could make similar change to minion if you think it is necessary, but it would be a bit hard for us to test it\r\n\r\nIf we are supporting configurable prexies, might as well support it for all. Yes, please make change to minion as

This proposal is to filter out null values in the form of predicates (leaf nodes of query execution). This has 2 potential issues:\r\n\r\n1) Incorrect results when transforms are used in aggregation functions (eg: MAX(ADD(A, B)) if either A or B is null, ADD should return NULL. However if we filter out nulls very early, then we will return a non null value here - which is not consistent with ANSI SQL.\r\n2) Multiple aggregation functions in the same query: This also might be inconsistent if we filter out the nulls very early in query execution.\r\n\r\nLooks like a better approach might be to \"tag\" DocIDs as null or non-nulls and let the aggregation function (or another intermediate node) process it in the right manner. However, this will affect the entire query execution flow and is a much bigger effort than what's proposed in this issue.\r\n\r\nThoughts ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/511595289/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/511676470","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/4368#issuecomment-511676470","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/4368","id":511676470,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMTY3NjQ3MA==","user":{"login":"siddharthteotia","id":2150694,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTA2OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2150694?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia","html_url":"https://github.com/siddharthteotia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-16T05:56:58Z","updated_at":"2019-07-16T05:56:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Rebased","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/511676470/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/511880217","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/4368#issuecomment-511880217","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/4368","id":511880217,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMTg4MDIxNw==","user":{"login":"siddharthteotia","id":2150694,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTA2OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2150694?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia","html_url":"https://github.com/siddharthteotia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-16T16:02:50Z","updated_at":"2019-07-16T16:02:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It looks like the build (for integration tests) was stalled.
