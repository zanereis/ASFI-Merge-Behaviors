PR is proof-of-concept of `lr_scheduler`. It works, but not perfect. There is one parameter I am still digging into, i.e. `epoch_size`.

Do I have to use CUDA 7.5 strictly? Since this Amalgamation is like a platform independent framework and it's only dependency is OpenBlas, why would we need the other things like cuda.

Since some parameter had bind to the base_executor, it goes to second branch in executor_manager.py:L118, in which case it does not check shared_data_arrays, but refer to base_exec.arg_arrays to retrieve the arg_arr. And in my case, two different parameter (encoder_data/5, decoder_l0_i2h_weight) happened to occupy the same slot in base_exec.arg_arrays, thus triggering the shape incompatible error. \n\nWhat I find weird is, when I go back to the original example using lstm for ptb language modeling. \nIt does not have any trouble in name-arrays alignment.\n\nDoes this have anything to do with my bucket setup. Since in seq2seq model, each bucket is a tuple of (encoder_len, decoder_len), while in ptb language model, bucket only contain seq_len?\n\nLooking forwards to your suggestion and help.\nThank you.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/195368334/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/195384294","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/842#issuecomment-195384294","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/842","id":195384294,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5NTM4NDI5NA==","user":{"login":"liuagen","id":16620677,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjIwNjc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16620677?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuagen","html_url":"https://github.com/liuagen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuagen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuagen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuagen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuagen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuagen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuagen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuagen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuagen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuagen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-11T14:21:35Z","updated_at":"2016-03-11T14:21:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I've got your idea and  I will try,Thanks.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/195384294/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/195476249","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/1615#issuecomment-195476249","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1615","id":195476249,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5NTQ3NjI0OQ==","user":{"login":"pluskid","id":3542,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3542?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid","html_url":"https://github.com/pluskid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-11T17:50:14Z","updated_at":"2016-03-11T17:50:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@0rchard Thanks for the information.
