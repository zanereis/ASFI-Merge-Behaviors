comment before reviewing any more changes. The LOBGlobals class is instantiated from the ex_globals constructor. The heap_ stored in LOBGlobals is derived from the executor heap. In ExLOB::Initialize, we get the lobGlobalHeap_ from the LOBGlobals->heap_ pointer. So the lobGlobalsHeap_ is not an STL heap.  Hence replacing the \"new\" from lobGlobalHeap_ with STL calls isn't really correct.

comment: It is good to have any local variables within the executor portion of the code unless we are sure it is allocated from the stack entirely.  Rationale: If the scope of the variable is at a statement level,  and allocated from the statement heap, it will be automatically deallocated when the statement heap is de-allocated. If any variable is allocated from system heap, it increases the possibility of creating fragmented memory though you have correctly deallocated the variable in question, Some other part of the code might have had some memory leaks from system heap and that caused the block of the memory to be left behind. This bloats the virtual memory of the process.
