\r\nThe code of this PR uses `momentjs` to parse the string to date.\r\nSpecifically, http://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/string/ \r\nIntegers are not of ISO8601 format so javascript's native method `Date` is called to parse the string.\r\nMore details can be found at  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/parse\r\nIn your example, integer strings smaller than 13 are parsed as `nn/01/2001` and `44` is parsed as `01/01/2044`.\r\nTo be honest I am also confusing why `23` and `24` are not parsed but it is definitely related to how `Date` parses them.\r\n
