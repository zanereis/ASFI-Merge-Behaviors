Why not do this like Heron. Every Topology has one component \"TopologyMaster\", TopologyMaster will collect all heartbeat then send this heartbeats to Nimbus.</p>\n\n<p>1. Add Pacemaker will add difficulty of maintain one cluster, especially take care of HA.<br/>\n2. It is hard to do extension, the Pacemaker will become the cluster's bottleneck, if it is become the cluster's bottleneck, it is very hard to do extension. If something is wrong with Pacemaker, it will impact all topology, not only one topology.<br/>\n3. The logic is a little complicated, the JStorm's TopologyMaster logic is more simple and clear, the code of handle heartbeat is no more than 300 lines. worker --> topologymaster --> nimbus, due to topologymaster is one component of Topology, it is easy to do HA. Even if the topologyMaster is down, it won't impact any other topology.

A lot of this depends on your use case and where the aggregated data is stored.  I really think the cloud dataflow API captures most of what an API like this should support.

If you see some other examples, like the nimbus hook (though it is not really a great example as its on nimbus side and not worker but still close) we ask the user to just provide the Fully qualified classname as a config option, create an instance of it using reflection and invoke prepare (start in your case) or cleanup on that instance. The only advantage of putting this as part of topology is that users will be able to provide objects that are completely serialized so it can be initialized with constructor args or with any other way that relies on instance variable initialization but I don't see that as a huge upside. On the other hand a consistent way to implement all hooks will make code easy to read and reason about.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612438489/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612438492","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/3968#issuecomment-2612438492","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/3968","id":2612438492,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI0Mzg0OTI=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-18T15:30:22Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T12:39:49Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=githubbot\">githubbot</a>:</i>\n<p>Github user schonfeld commented on a diff in the pull request:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/884#discussion_r45213316\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/884#discussion_r45213316</a></p>\n\n<p>    &#8212; Diff: storm-core/test/jvm/backtype/storm/utils/ThriftTopologyUtilsTest.java &#8212;<br/>\n    @@ -0,0 +1,94 @@<br/>\n    +/**<br/>\n    + * Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one<br/>\n    + * or more contributor license agreements.

But in our internal testing, Nimbus itself becomes a bottleneck before Pacemaker. Furthermore, it is <b>not</b> very hard to do extension. I have a prototype here for Pacemaker HA that only adds a small number of lines of code, which I am planning on pushing out in the relatively near future.<br/>\n3.
