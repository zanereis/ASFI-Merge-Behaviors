your comments all relate to a test that tests resuming from checkpoint - `ResumeFromCheckpointStreamingTest`.\r\nThis test reads a bunch of elements from Kafka, keeps the state in state internals implementation (checkpointed), and recovers to read more and fire in the second execution (with watermark hitting infinity).\r\nTo orchestrate this, while being able to terminate every run once its \"complete\", and eventually assert across multiple executions, I had to put in hooks to manually override the watermark that terminates pipeline execution and the expected number of assertions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/284665268/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/284680545","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/2168#issuecomment-284680545","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/2168","id":284680545,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NDY4MDU0NQ==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-07T10:19:53Z","updated_at":"2017-03-07T10:19:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer
