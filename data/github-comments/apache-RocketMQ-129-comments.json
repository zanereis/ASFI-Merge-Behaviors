between these two offset may confirmed by master, so slave should compute confirmOffset to maxOffset first.\r\n\r\n当一条日志被传输到 Follower，Follower 确认收到这条消息，主再把这条日志应用到自己的状态机时，通知客户端和通知所有的 follower 去 commit 这条日志这两件事是并行的，假如 leader 先回复 client 处理成功，此时 leader 宕机，由于其他 follower 的确认位点 confirm offset 一般会略低于 leader，中间这段未决日志还没应用到 follower 的状态机上，这时就出现了状态机不一致的情况，即已经写入 leader 的数据丢失了。所以当备切换为主的时候，直接截断就意味着客户端已经发送到主的消息丢失了，正确的水位应该被提升 max offset。但是备还没有收到 confirm 的 event，这个行为相当于要提交了未决消息。事实上新 leader 会遵守 \"Leader Completeness\" 的约定，切换时任何副本都不会删除也不会更改旧 leader 未决的 entry。新 leader 在新的 term 下，会直接应用一个较大的版本将未决的 entry 一起提交，这里副本组主备节点的行为共同保证了复制状态机的安全性。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1272197831/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1272199733","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/1159#issuecomment-1272199733","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/1159","id":1272199733,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl85L1Do1","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-08T02:18:10Z","updated_at":"2022-10-08T02:18:10Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This
