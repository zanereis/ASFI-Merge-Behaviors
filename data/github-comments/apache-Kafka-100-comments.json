Usually people are expecting to receive the `WakeupException` when calling `wakeup()` (e.g. because they want to shutdown), which means there's always a race where you might accidentally call it in between calls to `poll()`.

general question I would like to ask is that, what should we expect / tell users to do in the exception handler and in `getRuntime().addShutdownHook`? I think in general users should be able to call `streams.close` in the exception handler as well as shutdown hook (note this is per thread) since here may be more than one thread in the instance and when one of it abruptly stops, they may want to stop all other threads as well; however, I'm not sure if it is a good pattern to call `System.exit()` in the exception handler, since this is per thread, and instead we would only call `System.exit()` after the streams instance is completed shutdown.\n\nFor Kafka Server, here is the common recommended pattern:\n1. In `Kafka.scala`, where the main function is triggered to start the `KafkaServerStartable` class, the Shutdown hook is set to call `KafkaServerStartable.shutdown`, which is mainly for catching ctrl-c; it calls `System.exit(1)` on catching any exceptions while calling `KafkaServerStartable.startup`.\n2. In `KafkaServerStartable`, similar to above any exceptions will be caught with `System.exit(1)`; and in `shutdown` it will catch exceptions with `Runtime.getRuntime.halt(1)` to avoid deadlocks.\n\nThis is because the shutting down logic is caught in two functions `shutdown` and `awaitShutdown`, whereas `shutdown` only sets the flag and `awaitShutdown` is called after the `start` function.\n\nAs for Kafka Streams, I feel it is better to execute a similar pattern; more specifically, say we have not have exposed APIs to query the state of the instance (e.g. like if the instance is shutdown). I.e. 1) either you can implement the pattern indicated in the blog post where the `main` function thread just call `streams.start` and then call `streams.close` before exiting, or using the shutdown hook to call `streams.close`, or 2) keep the main thread alive after calling `streams.close` and then have a similar `awaitShutdown` function by polling on the instance state in the end before exiting, and then optionally add the per-thread exception handler to call `streams.close`.\n\nAs for the report scenario in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-4366, where the streams code may be only part of the whole `main` function logic, but the whole app still wants to exit when the streams have any exceptions, they can possibly fall into the second case above, where exception handler should only call `streams.close` and the main function wait on streams state to close and then `System.exit()`. What do you think? @dguy @enothereska @mjsax \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/259317716/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/259321666","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2117#issuecomment-259321666","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2117","id":259321666,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1OTMyMTY2Ng==","user":{"login":"mjsax","id":8959638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NTk2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8959638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax","html_url":"https://github.com/mjsax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-09T02:43:43Z","updated_at":"2016-11-09T02:43:43Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@guozhangwang @enothereska @dguy @miguno @hjafarpour \n\nI am not happy with the name `RobustConsumerRecordTimestampExtractor` but could not come up with anything better...

think I realize that the original idea of splitting the functionalities of the timestamp extractor and  the handler (for messages with invalid timestamps) might have been the better idea:  The timestamp extractor should only be responsible for extracting the timestamp, whereas the handler (which would be used e.g. inside `addRawRecords`) should only be responsible for determining what happens to records with invalid timestamps.\n\nAt the moment, we are in the unfortunate situation where, for example, the (new) timestamp extractor is effectively identical to the default extractor with regards to timestamp extraction.  The only difference is that it also logs a WARN message (which arguably is ok -- e.g. it may log information to say \"Hey, I came across a message that doesn't include a timestamp, and in my case I won't do anything about that and return a negative timestamp as-is, but at least I can let you know\") saying \"this message will be dropped\" (and this wording/information is wrong, because, based on its local knowledge, it can't determine whether or not any downstream code will or will not drop the message).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/259360348/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/259371168","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2051#issuecomment-259371168","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2051","id":259371168,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1OTM3MTE2OA==","user":{"login":"dguy","id":54829,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54829?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dguy","html_url":"https://github.com/dguy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dguy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dguy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dguy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dguy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dguy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dguy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dguy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dguy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dguy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-09T09:37:30Z","updated_at":"2016-11-09T09:37:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@guozhangwang updated to remove the `dirtyKeys.remove(..)` from evict\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/259371168/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/259380712","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2117#issuecomment-259380712","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2117","id":259380712,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1OTM4MDcxMg==","user":{"login":"dguy","id":54829,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54829?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dguy","html_url":"https://github.com/dguy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dguy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dguy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dguy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dguy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dguy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dguy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dguy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dguy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dguy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-09T10:22:37Z","updated_at":"2016-11-09T10:22:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"If we are going to go with this approach, i'm wondering if we should change the signature of `TimestampExtractor.extract` to: `long extract(ConsumerRecord<Object, Object> record, long currentStreamTime)` -
