After the above data has been created, use the search endpoint to run this query:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"from\": 0,\r\n  \"size\": 2,\r\n  \"indices\": [\r\n    \"*\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"query\": \"guid=snort_test_2\",\r\n  \"sort\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"field\": \"_timestamp\",\r\n      \"sortOrder\": \"ASC\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe result should look similar to the following, and have the messages we'd expect (one from snort and one from metaalerts):\r\n```\r\n\r\n{\r\n  \"total\": 2,\r\n  \"results\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"id\": \"snort_test_2\",\r\n      \"source\": {\r\n        \"msg\": \"snort test alert 2\",\r\n        \"threat:triage:rules:0:reason\": null,\r\n        \"ip_dst_port\": \"8080\",\r\n        \"ethsrc\": \"0A:00:27:00:00:00\",\r\n        \"threat:triage:score\": 10,\r\n        \"is_alert\": \"true\",\r\n        \"protocol\": \"TCP\",\r\n        \"source:type\": \"snort\",\r\n        \"ip_dst_addr\": \"192.168.66.121\",\r\n        \"ip_src_port\": \"50187\",\r\n        \"guid\": \"snort_test_2\",\r\n        \"ip_src_addr\": \"192.168.66.1\",\r\n        \"threat:triage:rules:0:score\": 10,\r\n        \"timestamp\": 1504708744000\r\n      },\r\n      \"score\": 1,\r\n      \"index\": \"snort_index_2017.09.06.14\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"id\": \"d414a9f2-7a03-4e47-9108-16b6fc800dd3\",\r\n      \"source\": {\r\n        \"average\": 10,\r\n        \"min\": 10,\r\n        \"median\": 10,\r\n        \"alert\": [\r\n          {\r\n            \"msg\": \"snort test alert\",\r\n            \"threat:triage:rules:0:reason\": null,\r\n            \"ip_dst_port\": \"8080\",\r\n            \"ethsrc\": \"0A:00:27:00:00:00\",\r\n            \"threat:triage:score\": 10,\r\n            \"is_alert\": \"true\",\r\n            \"protocol\": \"TCP\",\r\n            \"source:type\": \"snort\",\r\n            \"ip_dst_addr\": \"192.168.66.121\",\r\n            \"ip_src_port\": \"50187\",\r\n            \"guid\": \"snort_test_1\",\r\n            \"ip_src_addr\": \"192.168.66.1\",\r\n            \"threat:triage:rules:0:score\": 10,\r\n            \"timestamp\": 1504708744000\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            \"msg\": \"snort test alert 2\",\r\n            \"threat:triage:rules:0:reason\": null,\r\n            \"ip_dst_port\": \"8080\",\r\n            \"ethsrc\": \"0A:00:27:00:00:00\",\r\n            \"threat:triage:score\": 10,\r\n            \"is_alert\": \"true\",\r\n            \"protocol\": \"TCP\",\r\n            \"source:type\": \"snort\",\r\n            \"ip_dst_addr\": \"192.168.66.121\",\r\n            \"ip_src_port\": \"50187\",\r\n            \"guid\": \"snort_test_2\",\r\n            \"ip_src_addr\": \"192.168.66.1\",\r\n            \"threat:triage:rules:0:score\": 10,\r\n            \"timestamp\": 1504708744000\r\n          }\r\n        ],\r\n        \"max\": 10,\r\n        \"threat:triage:score\": 20,\r\n        \"count\": 2,\r\n        \"guid\": \"d414a9f2-7a03-4e47-9108-16b6fc800dd3\",\r\n        \"groups\": [\r\n          \"group_one\",\r\n          \"group_two\"\r\n        ],\r\n        \"sum\": 20,\r\n        \"status\": \"active\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"score\": 1,\r\n      \"index\": \"metaalerts\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/327590792/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/327616862","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/735#issuecomment-327616862","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/735","id":327616862,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNzYxNjg2Mg==","user":{"login":"mattf-apache","id":908957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwODk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/908957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache","html_url":"https://github.com/mattf-apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-06T21:25:19Z","updated_at":"2017-09-06T21:25:19Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"+1 by inspection, trusting your manual test.

My question with regards to the necessity for a refactor came from wanting to handle the exception in the HDFSWriter, where the exceptions where being caught at the time.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the tuples are 'unpaired' from their messages, and that we handle them all together seems to me to be problematic if you want to take per message/sourcehandle action.\r\n\r\nI think your approach removes the immediate problem with that, although having both the hdfs writer and the source handler itself take actions and split the 'ownership' doesn't feel quite right to me.\r\n\r\n@cestella It would be good to know why this is happening, but in truth, any persistent network connection in a long lived 'forever' type application needs to guard against these kinds of errors.\r\n\r\nFor reliability reasons, and where we want to get to, we require a more clear documentation of the failure and recovery states of the writers, esp. the hdfs as we are batching.  We also need to understand all the ways the stream can fail, to the extent that that is possible.\r\n\r\nI am not sure that limiting it to this one case is enough,  there will still be many possible ways to end up with a very unclear situation, that the writer is failing continuously and but the source handler is not removed from 'service'.  Users, as we have seen on the list will be left to track through system to work their way to this problem.  \r\n\r\nFailure to store is a critical failure of the system.  Esp. in systems where there are data retention rules or SLA's on data loss.  Thus we need in addition to the handling of this, an alerting strategy.\r\n\r\nWhile this fix ( questions pending ) is an improvement of the symptom, it does not address the higher level issue or severity of this problem.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/328243368/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/328243907","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/741#issuecomment-328243907","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/741","id":328243907,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyODI0MzkwNw==","user":{"login":"cestella","id":540359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella","html_url":"https://github.com/cestella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-09T00:55:54Z","updated_at":"2017-09-09T00:55:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I absolutely agree, this does not address the higher level issue or severity.

I know much of the innards of Stellar is only documented in the code (if that), so let's level set on that.  \r\n> \r\n> A \"StellarExecutor\" is responsible for running Stellar code for the REPL.  The executor can maintain additional \"Context\" that provides resources for the Stellar code that it is executing.  Each of these resources in the \"Context\" are called \"Capabilities\".   For example, a Zookeeper Client is available as a Capability called \"ZOOKEEPER_CLIENT\".  There is also the \"GLOBAL_CONFIG\" capability that exposes Metron's global configuration to Stellar code.\r\n> \r\n> These capabilities, like the GLOBAL_CONFIG, are exposed to Stellar code in the same way when running either in the REPL or in a topology.  A Stellar function can be written that fails if the GLOBAL_CONFIG is not available.  It can also be written to use acceptable defaults, if a GLOBAL_CONFIG does not exist.\r\n> \r\n> Previously the only way to create the GLOBAL_CONFIG in the REPL, was to have a Zookeeper service running with the Metron config deployed and then launch the REPL with `bin/stellar -z node1:2181\".  Without doing that there was no GLOBAL_CONFIG.  Any function that was written to expect a GLOBAL_CONFIG, was not usable in the REPL, unless you launched and configured a Zk instance.\r\n> \r\n> This PR provides the ability to...\r\n> (1) Create a GLOBAL_CONFIG manually in the REPL without the need for Zk and \r\n> (2) Modify a GLOBAL_CONFIG manually within a single session, without modifying Zk.\r\n> \r\n> There really is no such thing as an \"incompletely formed\" GLOBAL_CONFIG.  The GLOBAL_CONFIG is just a key/value store.  It contains whatever it contains.  But if there is a missing value in the GLOBAL_CONFIG that your function needs, then this change only makes it far simpler to add that missing value to the GLOBAL_CONFIG. \r\n> \r\n> And this is something you would need per your PR #690.  If you expect to run the REPL disconnected from a Metron cluster, then you need a way to create a GLOBAL_CONFIG without a Zk instance.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/328544266/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/328546043","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/740#issuecomment-328546043","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/740","id":328546043,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyODU0NjA0Mw==","user":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-11T14:26:16Z","updated_at":"2017-09-11T14:26:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"\"There really is no such thing as an \"incompletely formed\" GLOBAL_CONFIG.
