I would be happy if you do a johnzon-snippet module exposing such a constructor and using `Json.createGeneratorFactory(<....>)` while it is not in mapper/jsonb modules. Alternative would be to ensure at build with a maven plugin this constructor is never used outside tests with a comment explaining this is not a reliable API for a generic purposes as the mapper/jsonb instance (agree it is simpler when you know you are UTF-8 for ex but it is generally not true from johnzon standpoint). Guess personally I would expose it in `johnzon-json-extras` a bit by default since it is already a generic module for such extensions not having other strong dependencies and it requires almost no work except having a new SnippetBis class delegating to Json and Snippet.\r\nHope it makes
