@zhuangchong  \r\nHi, I don't think it's a good fix. \r\n\r\nThis code only considers the situation when a yarn job is done and collect its appId. However, when killing a running yarn job, there will be a remote network call to get all logs in `LogClientService`. If log size is large, this method maybe not a good solution.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I'm working on a new way to handle this which replace current way to collect appIds, and I am willing to submit a PR when I finish it!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1202302102/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1202319701","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/11261#issuecomment-1202319701","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/11261","id":1202319701,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms5HqfFV","user":{"login":"SbloodyS","id":17822915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODIyOTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17822915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SbloodyS","html_url":"https://github.com/SbloodyS","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SbloodyS/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SbloodyS/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SbloodyS/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SbloodyS/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SbloodyS/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SbloodyS/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SbloodyS/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SbloodyS/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SbloodyS/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-02T10:44:35Z","updated_at":"2022-08-02T10:44:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Is
