Even if it is, it seems to do redundant work, like looking at the URLs twice (in the `findClass(name);` call and the `super.loadClass(name, resolve);` call).\r\n\r\nWe have a working version of a ChildFirstClassLoader here, why not use that? Is that implementation suboptimal?\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/flink/blob/fa11845b926f8371e9cee47775ca0e48176b686e/flink-contrib/flink-statebackend-rocksdb/src/test/java/org/apache/flink/contrib/streaming/state/RocksDbMultiClassLoaderTest.java#L78\r\n\r\nWe should also never reference the System Classloader directly, it breaks all embedded setups or service architecture (OSGI) setups where you end up with hierarchical class loaders.\r\n\r\nMy feeling is also that this does many changes that may not be necessary, like change the setup of the client, packaged program, etc. Passing the configuration through everything makes this change rather involved.\r\n\r\nI was wondering if it is not sufficient to simply let the TaskManager pass this as a flag to the library cache manager. Then you would not need to pass configs everywhere - the only ever config access is by the TaskManager or Task when it creates the classloader, and the config is available there anyways. \r\n\r\nConcerning class loader setup on the client - not sure if we should change this in the same PR. This is probably much less critical (the main method does not instantiate many of the dependencies) and that part changes so heavily with flip-6 already. Various setups may not even have separate classloaders on the client anyways, but everything is in the app class loader there.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/323131099/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/323188476","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4534#issuecomment-323188476","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4534","id":323188476,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMzE4ODQ3Ng==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-17T20:42:31Z","updated_at":"2017-08-17T20:42:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @sunjincheng121, can you please update the PR description and fill out the PR template? \r\n\r\nThe community decided to extend the PR template and to be more strict about the PR submission process a few weeks ago.\r\nThank you.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/323188476/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/323237522","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4530#issuecomment-323237522","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4530","id":323237522,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMzIzNzUyMg==","user":{"login":"xccui","id":1452518,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NTI1MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1452518?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xccui","html_url":"https://github.com/xccui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xccui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xccui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xccui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xccui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xccui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xccui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xccui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xccui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xccui/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-18T01:42:08Z","updated_at":"2017-08-18T01:42:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for the comments @fhueske.

abstract class that contains a collection of `MessageParameter`s that are suppported for the given request, and provides a utiltiy method for checking whether these parameters were resolved\r\n* `MessageParameter` is also an abstract class, that defines the key, accepts a value (i.e. resolve the parameter), defines whether the parameter is mandatory/optional and whether it is a query/path parameter\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nLet's say we want to have a request for getting the details of a job, with a path parameter for the job id :\r\n\r\nWe first define a path parameter for the job id (or reuse an existing one!):\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic final class JobIDPathParameter extends MessagePathParameter {\r\n\tpublic JobIDPathParameter () {\r\n\t\tsuper(\"jobid\", MessageParameterRequisiteness.MANDATORY);\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tpublic void resolve(JobID jobID) {\r\n\t\tsuper.resolve(jobID.toString());\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe then define the sum of all parameters for the request:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic final class JobDetailsParameters extends MessageParameters {\r\n\tprivate final JobIDPathParameter jobID= new JobIDPathParameter ();\r\n\r\n\t@Override\r\n\tpublic Collection<MessageParameter> getParameters() {\r\n\t\treturn Collections.singleton(jobID);\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd finally, we include it in the JobDetailsHeaders:\r\n```\r\npublic final class JobDetailsHeaders extends MessageHeaders<JobDetailsRequest, JobDetailsResponse, JobDetailsMessageParameters> {\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe usage for the client would then look like this:\r\n```\r\nJobID jobID = ...\r\nJobDetailsParameters parameters = headers.getUnresolvedParameters();\r\nJobDetailsParameters.jobID.resolve(jobID);\r\nclient.sendRequest(headers, parameters, request);\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/324283573/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/324289208","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4546#issuecomment-324289208","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4546","id":324289208,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNDI4OTIwOA==","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-23T10:31:34Z","updated_at":"2017-08-23T10:31:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Please

I've reworked the client response parsing: the `ClientHandler` now only parses the response as JSON, whereas the conversion to the respective `ResponseBody` is handled in a future declared in `RestClientHandler#submitRequest()`. With this the `ClientHandler` is once again immutable and we don't have to do any casts.\r\n\r\nI've also reworked how handlers communicate failures: The `HandlerResponse` classes have been removed, and handlers may now throw a (checked) `RestHandlerException` or complete the future with an exception (with special treating for RestHandlerExceptions). Unchecked or non-RestHandlerExceptions are still treated as implementation errors and will return a \"500 Internal Server
