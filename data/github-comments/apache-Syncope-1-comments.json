allows to define and maintain the internal data model:\n- schema - defines which attribute types are available\n- classes: group schemas (similar to LDAP object classes)\n-  types: allow to assign

I have reverted your changes to `travis.yml` for this reason.\n\nNow, after running `mvn -PskipTests,all` from the root directory, you can move to `ide/eclipse/bundles/org.apache.syncope.ide.eclipse.tests` and launch `mvn -P eclipse-it`: this will first start the Syncope core locally via cargo, then execute the available tests.\n\nI have tried on my laptop and it works.\n\nYou should now revert your modifications here and manually apply the attached diff file and check if everything is
