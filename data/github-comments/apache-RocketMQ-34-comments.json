HmacSHA1这个算法是在${JAVA_HOME}/jre/lib/ext文件夹下的sunjce_provider.jar,所以需要将此目录增加到CLASSPATH中，注意如果启动脚本使用`-Djava.ext.dirs`，这个参数会将默认的ext覆盖掉，如果使用这个参数，注意将${JAVA_HOME}/jre/lib/ext追加到后面。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/489893747/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/489894219","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/403#issuecomment-489894219","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/403","id":489894219,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4OTg5NDIxOQ==","user":{"login":"xh800","id":33193403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTkzNDAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33193403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xh800","html_url":"https://github.com/xh800","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xh800/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xh800/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xh800/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xh800/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xh800/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xh800/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xh800/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xh800/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xh800/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-07T03:32:32Z","updated_at":"2019-05-07T03:32:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"大佬解决这个问题的思路是啥，膜拜","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/489894219/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/490140074","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/1196#issuecomment-490140074","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/1196","id":490140074,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MDE0MDA3NA==","user":{"login":"duhenglucky","id":7938968,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5Mzg5Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7938968?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky","html_url":"https://github.com/duhenglucky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-07T15:55:32Z","updated_at":"2019-05-07T15:55:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@aftersss

And I have also started some contributions to Jenkins Project. I have started solving few bugs and issues and currently working on few more bugs too. In a short period of time I will also start contributions to OpenGenus Foundation Open Source Projects. Actually I love coding and explore new technologies. I am good in data structures and algorithms and currently exploring advanced algorithms. I am very much interested in contributing to Open Source Projects and learn new things.\r\n\r\nIf you can provide me some material by which I can start then it would be a great help. Few materials which can help me understand the projects in a detailed manner, and few tutorials and materials or some thing which a contributor should know beforehand would be helpful.\r\nAnd do you have any gitter room or any means of communication where details of these projects are discussed ?\r\n\r\nI did not saw particular projects list for RocketMQ other than PHP and .Net Clients Project. Can you just share me some project ideas(adding features) for SoC19. I would like to choose a project which involves problem solving and writing code in Java as a main language. And do you have a project document which contains all details related to that project and also some important code files related to that project?\r\nMy email id is : nisshah1499@gmail.com\r\n\r\nWaiting for your reply.\r\n\r\nThanks and regards,\r\nNisarg Shah\r\n\r\n\r\n> On 23-May-2019, at 6:36 AM, Heng Du <notifications@github.com> wrote:\r\n> \r\n> @nisarg1499 Thanks for your attention，very glad that you are interested in the SoC19, so could you leave your email in here?
