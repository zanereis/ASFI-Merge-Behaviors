We can then define Federated Types like ROW(partitioning=ROW, replication=NONE)\r\n* Currently the federatedOutput flags are conditionally compiled into the instructions. We should add a three-valued logic here (true, false, none) where true/false forced the instruction to act a certain way, while none preserves the current heuristic runtime semantics.\r\n* We need to fix (i.e., remove) all the stateful string concatenation  ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/841874157/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/842307021","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/1275#issuecomment-842307021","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1275","id":842307021,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0MjMwNzAyMQ==","user":{"login":"corepointer","id":49227510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MjI3NTEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49227510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/corepointer","html_url":"https://github.com/corepointer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corepointer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corepointer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corepointer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corepointer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corepointer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corepointer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corepointer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corepointer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corepointer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-17T13:04:15Z","updated_at":"2021-05-17T13:04:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hello and thank you for your effort in this PR! \r\nIn general I agree with Sebastian, it looks good, but if I may chime in with additional questions:\r\nWhy is Pillow used?

That way you can stick to the supposed separation of compiler and runtime, and can easily scale to distributed runtimes such as Spark and federated.\r\n\r\nExcellent question.\r\n\r\nThe instruction strings then would have to be able to contain nested structures, since the workload tree provide means of separating different loops into sub tree nodes in the structure. If a string instruction containing this should be constructed it means that the string ends up with different lengths depending on how many sub loops are executed.\r\n\r\nProviding an id to the structure and storing the tree somewhere else seams more scalable and flexible to future modifications where new types of instructions are added to the WTree.\r\n\r\nAlso note that currently we look up our matrix objects the same way via an id provided to the instruction string, (just with another back-end that we have worked with much much longer). The reason why I'm not using that back-end is because it require specific data types contained, like Data, MatrixValue, MatrixBlock, FrameBlock, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/857614373/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/857632778","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/1299#issuecomment-857632778","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1299","id":857632778,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg1NzYzMjc3OA==","user":{"login":"fathollahzadeh","id":6640047,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NDAwNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6640047?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fathollahzadeh","html_url":"https://github.com/fathollahzadeh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fathollahzadeh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fathollahzadeh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fathollahzadeh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fathollahzadeh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fathollahzadeh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fathollahzadeh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fathollahzadeh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fathollahzadeh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fathollahzadeh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-09T11:57:44Z","updated_at":"2021-06-09T11:57:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> A few comments, I have issues with the syntax for @,,, , double array allocations, and the tests. but otherwise it looks fine.\r\n> I am unsure how much of the code is actually executed in the tests, maybe you want to see what parts are covered using jacoco?\r\n> \r\n> most importantly the tests are missing verification of the actual values parsed and written to disk since the tests currently only verify that there are no crashes.\r\n\r\nThanks for reviewing PR @Baunsgaard .

Overall, I think this map is fine - generating a unique token, storing the WTree globally under this token, and compiling the token into the compression instruction for later access is (in my opinion) the best option here. We could further make the WTree part of the normal explain output - that way it's not much different from our dictionaries of functions that are shown in the explain after compilation and then called from multiple different places.\r\n\r\nSome minor additional comments:\r\n* The rework of the WTree seem to have lost the begin/end line information (for the explain output). Especially in large scripts like GLM with >1000 lines and many removed statement blocks during compilation, this information is crucial for effective debugging.\r\n* The global map for token lookups could be hardened for concurrent access by different threads (e.g., JMLC) and be made part of the cleanup logic to prevent resource leaks in programmatic APIs. Furthermore, there is no need to create singleton instances of this map - instead it could be a simple class with a static member variable and static methods (which would avoid unnecessary indirections).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/859754787/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/860617026","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/1254#issuecomment-860617026","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1254","id":860617026,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2MDYxNzAyNg==","user":{"login":"Baunsgaard","id":9947148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5NDcxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9947148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard","html_url":"https://github.com/Baunsgaard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-14T11:39:22Z","updated_at":"2021-06-14T11:39:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi, @clarapueyoballarin \r\n\r\nI can see the tests are working, do you think this is ready for review?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/860617026/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/860628621","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/1316#issuecomment-860628621","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1316","id":860628621,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2MDYyODYyMQ==","user":{"login":"phaniarnab","id":4302361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDIzNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4302361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab","html_url":"https://github.com/phaniarnab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-14T12:01:18Z","updated_at":"2021-06-14T12:01:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM.\r\nThanks for the fix.
