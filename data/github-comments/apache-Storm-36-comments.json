I don't think this is a valid assumption and I would like to move to either one of the following two models :<br/>\n   Option 1 : Before performing any leader like operation the code checks if it still has the leadership lock. This will not be a zk call but an internal in memory state. All tasks that requires leadership checks must finish in min(zkSessionTimeout, zkConnectionTimeout) as that represents nimbus lock's leasing period. We need to implement stateListeners for zookeeper that can update the actual leadership state based on connection and session states. <br/>\n  Options 2: We don't check for leadership at each stage but still implement stateListeners and just restart nimbus anytime we get a zk connection /session loss which does not resolve itself in the leasing timeout period. </p>\n\n\n<p>2) As @revans2 pointed out if nimbus schedules a topology before a backup can download the code and then nimbus dies then that topology will not be scheduled after failover. Again multiple options:<br/>\n   Option 1: Use a distributed file system implementation as mentioned in the jira description.<br/>\n   Option 2: Do not return from the submitTopology until \"n\" backups also have the topology copy. This means any new nimbus leader contender will only start contending for a leader lock once it is completely caught up and any new leader will have to validate it is actually caught up  before it can accept any leadership task. This option requires more state management and it is harder to test for correctness.<br/>\n  Option 3: Live with the issue and hope that bittorrent will solve this. </p>\n\n<p>My favourite is option 1.<br/>\nLet me know if there are any other issues/options that needs to be covered.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612443636/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/54242144","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/209#issuecomment-54242144","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/209","id":54242144,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MjQyMTQ0","user":{"login":"EdisonXu","id":1414637,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTQ2Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1414637?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdisonXu","html_url":"https://github.com/EdisonXu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdisonXu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdisonXu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdisonXu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdisonXu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdisonXu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdisonXu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdisonXu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdisonXu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdisonXu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-09-03T01:42:59Z","updated_at":"2014-09-03T01:42:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"sorry

So I think it would be better to just make the encoding for the page UTF-8.\n\n+1\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/54327829/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/54355882","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/209#issuecomment-54355882","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/209","id":54355882,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MzU1ODgy","user":{"login":"revans2","id":3441321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDEzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3441321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2","html_url":"https://github.com/revans2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-09-03T19:55:00Z","updated_at":"2014-09-03T19:55:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I am still +1.  \n\n@d2r Thanks for the very complete review \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/54355882/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/54369457","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/219#issuecomment-54369457","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/219","id":54369457,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MzY5NDU3","user":{"login":"ptgoetz","id":260896,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDg5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/260896?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz","html_url":"https://github.com/ptgoetz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-09-03T21:21:49Z","updated_at":"2014-09-03T21:21:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@revans2 I just did a bunch of digging related to how the shade plugin handles dependencies.

rel=\"kabhwan\">Jungtaek Lim</a> I reproduce this situation everytime in the case below：<br/>\nIn my case,there are 5 machines,4 machines for supervisor with 6 port and 1 for nimbus; my topology use 24 worker（this means all the ports in the supervisors); But there is a little trick, the prepare method in my bolt just throw exception and do nothing else, this will cause the worker exit immediately. Then other worker will exit with log that <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=itaifrenkel\" class=\"user-hover\" rel=\"itaifrenkel\">Itai Frenkel</a> mentioned before.</p>\n\n<p>I read the code and found that in my situation, when the  first worker(we named it as A) exit, other worker has not connect to worker A, so they retried for many times and closing this Client, note that connect logic is async and called from Client Constructor; Because connect and send method are synchronized, send must wait until connect returned, but when send run, close had been called by connect and mark closing as true, so connect will throw that Exception;</p>\n\n<p>But i am still confused if this can happen: just remove the Exception in Bolt::prepare, and worker A exit for some unknown reason, and worker B connect to worker A will fail after retry, and then worker B can send tuple to worker A, this will end up with call send again, this will cause worker B exit by that Exception. You may say that nimbus will find worker A exit and tell worker B not send tuple to worker A any more, but worker and nimbus connected by zookeeper, and worker read nimbus's command Periodically, this is done by mk-refresh-connections. mk-refresh-connections and send share the same RWlock, when the machine load is heavy, there is a chance that mk-refresh-connections not called between the sends, where the first send has close the connection in Client;</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612477496/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/54475217","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/209#issuecomment-54475217","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/209","id":54475217,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NDc1MjE3","user":{"login":"d2r","id":905298,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNTI5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/905298?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2r","html_url":"https://github.com/d2r","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2r/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2r/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2r/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2r/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2r/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2r/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2r/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2r/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2r/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-09-04T13:24:44Z","updated_at":"2014-09-04T13:24:44Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@EdisonXu Yes, it is fixed now.
