\r\nWhen you have time. Here's some findings on the perl GPU CI failures.\r\nThis is the output of 'ldd libmxnet.so' from the CI testing docker.\r\nhttps://builds.apache.org/blue/organizations/jenkins/incubator-mxnet/detail/PR-8080/1/pipeline/295/#step-636-log-61\r\nas you can see libcuda.so.1 => not found\r\nThis is the root of the perl GPU failure; from what I understand the rtc::CudaModule uses cuLaunchKernel driver function that is supposed to be defined in libcuda.so.1 (it is defined there)\r\nso when libmxnet.so is compiled it is linked against the lib that is /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcuda.so.1\r\nThis is runtime driver and as far as I know it's being put on the box via this\r\n```\r\nksv@ubuntu:~$ dpkg -l|grep cuda\r\nii  libcuda1-340                                          340.102-0ubuntu0.14.04.1+gpu14.04.1                 amd64        NVIDIA CUDA runtime library\r\n```\r\nor similar driver package.\r\nPerl GPU fails because perl swig .so links itself against secondary dependencies libmxnet.so recursively. Python code on other side just dl_open libmxnet.so from base.py without having separate intermediate .so. So far so good, we'll be working on seeing if we can disable recursive linking.\r\nOne real question though remains, how python rtc tests succeed without having the lib in CI docker?\r\nI looked through other cuda libraries in /usr/local/cuda/lib64 and closest match to cuLaunchKernel\r\nis cudaLaunchKernel from /usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcudart.so but it has different signature.\r\nI hope you can see if you can find the answer to this question.\r\nThank you \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/332966128/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/332974845","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/4946#issuecomment-332974845","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/4946","id":332974845,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMjk3NDg0NQ==","user":{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-28T21:54:41Z","updated_at":"2017-09-28T21:54:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This issue is closed due to lack of activity in the last 90 days.
