All.\r\n\r\nI have finished the code and the design needs to be changed a bit.\r\n\r\n#### 1. Add warning_type in t_ds_alert table\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nALTER TABLE `t_ds_alert` ADD COLUMN `warning_type` tinyint(4) DEFAULT '2' COMMENT '1 process is successfully, 2 process/task is failed';\r\n```\r\n\r\nSave the warning type when the alert is triggered.  And the default value is 2.\r\n\r\nThe reason why use warning_type because of we have this enum warning_type in the code, and we don't need to create the new enum.\r\n\r\nAnd in the future when we want to add new alert situation we just needs to change one place code.\r\n\r\n#### 2. Don't need to add column in t_ds_alert_plugin_instance table\r\n\r\nI add a new input param named `warningType` in AlertPluginManager class. And installPlugin function will add this params to all plugins. \r\n\r\nHas three choice, success fail all. The default value is all.\r\n\r\nThe judging strategy is same as above, when the plugin params has no `warningType` field and the default value is all  to compatible with historical logic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd I merged Plan 2 Save the alert strategy when triggered & Plan 3 Change the login to match strategy.\r\n\r\nPlease to be reviewed.  #8636","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1055248746/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1055249287","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/pull/7032#issuecomment-1055249287","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/7032","id":1055249287,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms4-5dOH","user":{"login":"songjianet","id":19239641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjM5NjQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19239641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/songjianet","html_url":"https://github.com/songjianet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songjianet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songjianet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songjianet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songjianet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songjianet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songjianet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songjianet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songjianet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songjianet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-01T10:02:19Z","updated_at":"2022-03-01T10:02:19Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thank you for your contribution, but since this issue has not been dealt with for a long time, I will close it.
