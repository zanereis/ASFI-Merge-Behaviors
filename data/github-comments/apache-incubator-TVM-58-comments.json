think there is some misunderstanding here. To be clear, I did not propose to enumerate all the intrinsics in the pass itself. We just need a formal specification of what this registry is, and how can we design it so that the registry can be used to collect other information about the intrinsic, other than in-place information.\r\n\r\nThe main danger of this backend hook property is that it is scattered, and one solution to alleviate that is again through a centralized registry like the op registry https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/master/include/tvm/relay/op.h\r\n\r\nTo give a concrete example, in our case of operator registry.  Currently, relay's op registry allows us to introduce additional attribute about the intrinsic, for example, you can use the following code to introduce an in-place property later, to a later registered operator property \"myexp\".\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom tvm import relay\r\n\r\nrelay.op.register(\"myexp\", \"TInplace\", 1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe key here is: \r\n- We have a centralized registry to go to when we need certain properties. \r\n- We have a clear documented list of properties that can be registered and queried by the passes https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/master/include/tvm/relay/op_attr_types.h\r\n    - This avoids fragmentation of the code and increases the maintainability \r\n\r\nNote that in your case, assume ```cce.copy``` is a target-dependent intrinsic, then this kind of registry satisfies our need.  So far the operator property registry is only introduced in the high-level IR(relay) I am proposing to design a similar one in the low-level IR, for the intrinsics, and use the intrinsic information registry as \"backend hook\".\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/435958490/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/435962371","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2056#issuecomment-435962371","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2056","id":435962371,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNTk2MjM3MQ==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-05T17:30:59Z","updated_at":"2018-11-05T17:30:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks @kun-zh Likely we do not need the field fix_order_args.  The args field before the split follows the order given to the build.  The main question is that during the procedure of split host device, the device function argument code happen in arbitrary order. \r\n\r\nThis is not a bug for customized op as long as user directly calls the generate host function. Because the host code still calls into the device code using the correct order. If we want to solve this problem, then we will somehow try to order the arguments in the device code. \r\n\r\nNote that the arguments to the device code does not necessarily corresponds to the host argument(for example, a Buffer in the args could become the data field, or the shape arguments etc).

LLVM recommends us to only do alloca in the head of the function.\r\n- In our case, we alloca the out temporary space to store the result of the GetFuncFromEnv. We did it in a loop before. Because we didn't cache the result of the packed_function handle, we call alloca each time we call GetFuncFromEnv and it results in a stack overflow.\r\n- Either the problem(of handle cache, or alloca location) would have resolved the problem.\r\n   - If we cache the handle, alloca is only called once(because next time handle is not null)\r\n   - If we lift alloca, the temporary space is allocated at beginning of the function and used repeatively even if we call GetFuncFromEnv multiple times.\r\n\r\nBut since both are actually problems, so this PR fixes both.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/436322099/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/436334708","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/1718#issuecomment-436334708","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1718","id":436334708,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNjMzNDcwOA==","user":{"login":"FrozenGene","id":7287321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyODczMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7287321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene","html_url":"https://github.com/FrozenGene","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-06T17:19:03Z","updated_at":"2018-11-06T17:19:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> @srkreddy1238 are you adding layout trasnform ops into the network?

@tmoreau89 @jroesch excellent. \r\n\r\nI want to make certain that the 'larger' impact of the deferred rounding concept to be able to get away with much smaller representations and thus improve communication/memory bandwidth and power efficiency, requires a higher-order instruction called a fused dot-product. Managing this fused dot product as an atomic operation is important, but it impacts all the BLAS operators that depend on it (matvec, matmul, etc.). The fun starts when you need to manage resource contention and need to start blocking the fused dot-products. That is why it is so important to start the collaboration between the IR, its code generator, and the instruction set of the hw. If you look at TensorFlow and PyTorch it is clear that they didn't have this collaboration and both environments are not easily modified to introduce these new number systems.\r\n\r\nHow do I get plugged in and contribute to this in TVM/VTA?

I think we should have a global centralized registry attributes where all the backend can register on. \r\n\r\n- For backend specific intrinsics, there should be no naming conflict(e.g. use cuda prefix for cuda only intrinsics). If an intrinsic shares name among backends, that should really mean they need to have similar behavior. We can still get backend specific behavior by having a target aware dispatcher for common names.\r\n- It is true that a single function might be able to cover multiple intrinsic, in that case, just register it for each intrinsic is not redundant, note that the function is only defined once.\r\n- We can enable any arguments to the registered function, but should really be careful about the choice
