When this `kind` is specified, the OW backend resolves that to whatever the current default should be (as determined by the mapping in `DefaultRuntimeVersions.scala`).  This mapping can be updated/applied to more runtimes as needed.\n\nHaving an explicit alias is useful for situations when the `kind` cannot be determined from the file(s) from which the action is being created. That being said, the CLIs have been updated to use the \"nodejs:default\" `kind` for .js files when no `kind` was explicitly provided.\n\nResolving this on the backend allows all clients (CLI, REST, Bluemix, etc.) to make use of this new alias, without duplicating logic for resolving what that alias should mean.\n\nIt is important to note that the alias is not recorded as the action's `kind`, but rather the resolved \"real\" `kind` is stored with the action. This means that once the `kind` is resolved to a real runtime (e.g. \"nodejs:6\"), that is the `kind` for that action until such point that it is explicitly updated by a client.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/228538408/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/228554461","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/767#issuecomment-228554461","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/767","id":228554461,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyODU1NDQ2MQ==","user":{"login":"domdom82","id":1755853,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTU4NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1755853?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82","html_url":"https://github.com/domdom82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-25T16:29:34Z","updated_at":"2016-06-25T16:29:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Could we instead drop installing gradle altogether and only use `gradlew`?

However, with the change being made to make nodejs 6 the default in https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk/pull/738 all async js actions (such as pipe.js etc.....) installed by the install scripts will fail when run.

I also moved the `ADD` command down as well.\n- The go-cli build checks for a `WHISK_BUILD_TIMESTAMP` environment variable.  If it exists, it uses that value as the timestamp.  Subsequent builds will use this same timestamp value, and if it is not changed and there are no Go CLI code changes, the build pulls from the cache (10-20 second Go CLI builds).  If that env variable is not set, a timestamp is dynamically generated, causing the Go build to occur (i.e. cache is ignored).\n\nThe environment variable can be changed to pull from a file, or gradle property..
