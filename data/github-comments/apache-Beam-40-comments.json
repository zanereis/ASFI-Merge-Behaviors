This should be good to merge now from my side.\n\nI'm quite confident that the Flink side is good now, I had to change some code in other parts, though, that would need review from someone knowledgeable in Beam. These changes are in the commits after the two main implementation commits. I'm thinking @tgroh, @dhalperi or @kennknowles  for this. If one of you would have a look that would be perfect. (The one I'm most unsure about is this one: ed1e01ac78793227168ec7a20f6a45cb8b5ba293).\n\nAlso, both `SideInputHandler` and `SideInputHandlerTest` would probably benefit from another pass over them.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/241248506/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/241254796","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/1#issuecomment-241254796","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/1","id":241254796,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MTI1NDc5Ng==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-21T12:31:28Z","updated_at":"2016-08-21T12:31:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/builds/6179443/badge)](https://coveralls.io/builds/6179443)\n\nChanges Unknown when pulling **2efe7617a595b8ac6167db40724d9874afd6df23 on francesperry:master** into *\\* on apache:master**.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/241254796/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/241324732","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/826#issuecomment-241324732","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/826","id":241324732,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MTMyNDczMg==","user":{"login":"dhalperi","id":526415,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNjQxNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/526415?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi","html_url":"https://github.com/dhalperi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-22T06:28:58Z","updated_at":"2016-08-22T06:28:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Refactored and unit tested what i can.

The context stays external to the runner along with its state (running, stopped, ...) (we can add a `isStopped` call just before calling the execution logic to make sure that the context is up & running and fail the execution otherwise). This way the SparkRunner doesn't have to deal with the context's state and it doesn't matter if the context is an SJS or a shell
