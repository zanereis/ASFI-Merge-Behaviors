First, we are not using contains logic, so basically it's plain container or collection for either list or set. Second, a simple benchmarking test shows list has better performance in both time and memory, similar as in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10799417/performance-and-memory-allocation-comparison-between-list-and-set\r\n\r\nThe most fundamental problem is this class is violating the contract of Object.hashCode, it confuses people as two equaled objects can have different hashcode, what's worse, as in the description, it doesn't work well with hash-based collections. There is no direct logic breaking. This is a cleanup and performance boost.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/1535621177/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/1536377891","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/helix/pull/2478#issuecomment-1536377891","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2478","id":1536377891,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAPIHxc5bk0Qj","user":{"login":"desaikomal","id":98000016,"node_id":"U_kgDOBddckA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98000016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal","html_url":"https://github.com/desaikomal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-05T14:51:01Z","updated_at":"2023-05-05T14:51:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jiajunwang - can you please elaborate on performance concern?

For example, if it is delay caused wrong assignment, then let's resolve it in best possible. This is same story here. So we can keep each stage do its own work.\r\n\r\nAlso adding this hybrid (assignment and throttling) mode, can cause the more complexity in throttling and the debugging will be much much harder. Say if user would like to ask why the message has been throttled, previous logic is simple, we can clear tell it is throttled because of out of quota. But now, we need to go through same analysis for assignment and tell the reason of why the state transition is throttled.\r\n\r\n\r\n@jiajunwang what do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/1536567902/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/1536624692","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/helix/pull/2478#issuecomment-1536624692","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2478","id":1536624692,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAPIHxc5blwg0","user":{"login":"jiajunwang","id":1803880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDM4ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1803880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang","html_url":"https://github.com/jiajunwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-05T18:30:48Z","updated_at":"2023-05-05T18:30:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I had to download the code to remind myself what happened exactly...\r\nSince we have added an index to cover searching functionality, I agree that it seems the Set here can be changed to List.

I like the straightforward way the problems and proposals are elaborated. The github wiki is not easy for us to comment, if we are looking for more external comments, I would suggest creating a Google Doc first and then convert to wiki when the idea is converged. cc @desaikomal \r\n\r\nGiven that saying, here're my thoughts:\r\n1. Highlevel idea makes sense. And we should do it.\r\n2. Kind of extending the topic a little bit.\r\nIf we believe the \"capacity\" of the node can precisely predict it's real capability of hosting workload, do we still need evenness? Does it make sense if we just add partitions to a node until the workload weight is about to exceed \"capacity\"? What I'm trying to say is that, if users are using this weight/capacity system more seriously, we shall consider simplify the design instead of adding more layers to it. The thing is that, although each design makes great sense, if we implement all of them in one system, the system becomes too complicated and unmanagible.\r\nOn the other hand, if the \"capacity\" is just rough estimate, is it worthy to precisely control the transient transitions and sacrifice converge speed?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/1548217591/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/1548464387","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/helix/issues/2468#issuecomment-1548464387","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2468","id":1548464387,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAPIHxc5cS7ED","user":{"login":"desaikomal","id":98000016,"node_id":"U_kgDOBddckA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98000016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal","html_url":"https://github.com/desaikomal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-15T19:38:29Z","updated_at":"2023-05-15T19:38:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I couldn't find a way to share Google doc from my official LinkedIn account.
