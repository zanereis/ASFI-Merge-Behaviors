Some comments/questions:\n1. You seem to have added support for all(?) of the language-specific analyzers in Lucene. This is good, though even better would be to be able to override these in the configuration (similar to the way it is already possible to use a custom analyzer with jena-text).\n2. You are changing the method signatures for some public methods, e.g. TextDatasetFactory.createLuceneIndex, TextDatasetFactory.createLucene, TextIndexLucene constructor. I'm not sure that this is a good idea as it might break other people's code that call those methods. I suggest that you add methods that support the old parameters, which can then call the extended variants. This way, you shouldn't need to change the existing tests, as you currently do.\n3. This seems a bit suspicious:\n-            if (indexer instanceof TextIndexLuceneMultiLingual) {\n-                String lang = o.getLiteral().language();\n-                ((TextIndexLuceneMultiLingual)indexer).addEntity(entity, lang);\n-            }\n-            else\n-                indexer.addEntity(entity) ;\n\nWould it be possible to avoid the instanceof check and simply detect the language from within the entity? (possibly extending Entity instead, if it doesn't keep track of the language of the literal) I.e. this code would just be \"indexer.addEntity(entity)\" as it used to be and the magic to detect the language would be within TextIndexLuceneMultiLingual.addEntity(entity) where it arguably belongs...\n1. I see that you have touched the existing unit tests (which I think may be a bad idea, see above) but you have not written unit test that specifically test the multilingual indexing. Would it be possible for you to add some of those? These would also serve as examples for the usage and expected behavior.\n2.

I'm not familiar with assembler configuration. But if you want to give some help ;-)\n\nI'll try. I've done two jena-text patches in the past, and in both cases I added support for assembler configuration.\n\nFor your patch I think it would be useful to be able to enable/disable multilingual indexing in a particular jena-text index (default should be to disable it, for backwards compatibility). Adjusting the particular language-specific indexers, as I originally suggested, is not very important at this point.\n\nThinking about assembler configuration, I think it would be easiest to plug this in as an alternative to the current Analyzer variants (StandardAnalyzer, SimpleAnalyzer, KeywordAnalyzer, LowerCaseKeywordAnalyzer). You can look at my patch in [JENA-776](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JENA-776) that added the LowerCaseKeywordAnalyzer variant. Basically you need to create a new class such as MultilingualAnalyzerAssembler (similar to the other *AnalyzerAssembler classes) and plug support for it into TextAssembler. It's shouldn't be very difficult...\n\n> 1. Ok, I will refactor it to leave previous signatures and calls.\n> 2. Sure, it's more clean to extend Entity... ok, todo list. \n\nExcellent!\n\n> For the tests and doc, I 'm pretty busy at the moment.\n\nI can't speak for Jena officially as I'm just an occasional contributor with an interest in jena-text, but Jena has very good unit test coverage and I think unit tests are expected from new contributions as well. If you won't write unit tests for this, I bet nobody else will... Again it's not very hard, you can look at my LowerCaseKeywordAnalyzer patch for an example.\n\nRegarding documentation, I think that what's needed is to update the main jena-text document, particularly the [Configuring an Analyzer](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/query/text-query.html#configuring-an-analyzer) section. I'm not 100% sure how it is technically maintained these days, but it used to be maintained via the CMS that [you can use](http://www.apache.org/dev/cmsref#non-committer) to provide a documentation patch. But I think it should be fine also to just provide an update as a comment here on GitHub. Again see JENA-776 for an example, there I just wrote up the small change to the documentation as a comment and @afs picked it up from there.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/97329735/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/97699765","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/53#issuecomment-97699765","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/53","id":97699765,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk3Njk5NzY1","user":{"login":"osma","id":1132830,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzI4MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1132830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma","html_url":"https://github.com/osma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-30T08:04:03Z","updated_at":"2015-04-30T08:04:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi Alexis! Thanks for the code!\n\nThis just screams for unit tests that show that it actually works in all cases...\n\nI'm a bit worried about the BORDER_DELIMITER trick used here. It seems very fragile. For example, what happens if I have these two triples indexed using jena-text:\n\nex:paris rdfs:label \"Paris\"@fr .\nex:paris rdfs:label \"Paris\"@en .\n\nThen the second triple is deleted. Will both entries be dropped from the Lucene index?\n\nSimilar things may happen for variants that differ only in letter case (which will be folded to lowercase by most analyzers), or singular/plural forms that get stemmed into the same base form. These may all cause false matches when entries are about to be deleted.\n\nIf I had to implement something like this, I'd instead try to store the original literal in the Lucene index, as intact as possible. In practice, putting the string value and language tag in separate fields which store the values without tokenizing (like the uri and graph fields currently). Then at deletion time it would be easy to query for the exact same entry and remove it, and only it, from the Lucene index.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/97699765/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/97955739","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/53#issuecomment-97955739","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/53","id":97955739,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk3OTU1NzM5","user":{"login":"amiara514","id":5551714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTE3MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5551714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514","html_url":"https://github.com/amiara514","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-30T20:25:43Z","updated_at":"2015-04-30T20:25:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi Osma,\n\n> ex:paris rdfs:label \"Paris\"@fr .\n> ex:paris rdfs:label \"Paris\"@en .\n\nIndeed, both of them will be dropped (however, can be solved with multi language proposal)\n\n> Similar things may happen for variants that differ only in letter case (which will be folded to lowercase by most analyzers), or singular/plural forms that get stemmed into the same base form.

A hash with sufficient uniqueness guarantees could work here. I think it should incorporate all parts of the quad (subject, predicate, literal value + language, named graph). This way, the entries in the Lucene index would correspond exactly to quads. When a quad gets deleted, the corresponding entry can be uniquely identified via the hash and deleted from the Lucene index as well.\n\nBut I'm not sure how this would interact with the recent work done by Chris Dollin (@ehedgehog) on cross field conjunctive queries (pull request #42 and [JENA-686](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JENA-686)). In that work, the Lucene index is modified so that entries (\"documents\") in the Lucene index do not correspond to triples/quads, but instead there is one entry per subject resource (which may incorporate information from several triples/quads), allowing more efficient conjunctive queries on the Lucene index level. How would you deal with deletions in such a scenario?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/98649858/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/98744341","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/53#issuecomment-98744341","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/53","id":98744341,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk4NzQ0MzQx","user":{"login":"amiara514","id":5551714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTE3MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5551714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514","html_url":"https://github.com/amiara514","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-04T15:11:23Z","updated_at":"2015-05-04T15:15:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I'm curious, how would the multi language proposal help with this problem?\n\nMultilingual index manages dynamically one index per language.

In fact, it might be better to tease out different sets of changes.  Could you give a quick overview of the changes?\n\nOverall, this looks like a great set of changes, including using classes available in Google Guava to replace ones in Jena (e.g. MultiMap, MultiSet).\n\n#### `oaj.atlas.lib.Closeable`\n\nAdding `extends java.io.Closeable` causes about 76 more warnings in the code base because `java.io.Closeable` is interpreted by the compiler specially. Some of the classes that use `oaj.atlas.lib.Closeable` aren't suitable for try-resource.\n\nMaybe some of these classes don't really need closeable but that needs checking.  Can we pull this out as a separate strand and not include it in the general Java8 overhaul?\n\n#### `NodeTransform`\n\nThis is an important abstraction in the SPARQL optimizer.  Can we keep it, define it as `extends Function<Node, Node>` and keep use of `NodeTransform`? (There are times in Java when it would be nice to say \"interface/class A is the same as B\" where B is a complex expression, but you can't).  It makes finding `NodeTransform`s easier and makes interfaces clearer as to purpose.  The optimizer code is not general java code.\n\n#### `@Deprecated`\n\nI noticed this on `Lib.equal` and it seems to be a style in the PR to say \"Prefer\" in the javadoc. It gets highlighted in javadoc if `@deprecated` is used.\n\nJENA-931\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/99023698/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/99062926","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/53#issuecomment-99062926","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/53","id":99062926,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk5MDYyOTI2","user":{"login":"osma","id":1132830,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzI4MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1132830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma","html_url":"https://github.com/osma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-05T12:11:24Z","updated_at":"2015-05-05T12:11:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Multilingual index manages dynamically one index per language.

The latter case makes deletion much more difficult, as there is no longer a 1:1 mapping between quads and Lucene documents.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/99062926/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/99066248","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/53#issuecomment-99066248","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/53","id":99066248,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk5MDY2MjQ4","user":{"login":"osma","id":1132830,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzI4MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1132830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma","html_url":"https://github.com/osma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-05T12:31:20Z","updated_at":"2015-05-05T12:31:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"There was a discussion thread around this topic on the Jena dev mailing list in late February, starting with this message: http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/jena-dev/201502.mbox/%3CCAPTxtVNzCAEKNQepeQ3hZsBmd7a1%2BNhJo0My1GOJF0GorMmYKA%40mail.gmail.com%3E\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/99066248/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/99072949","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/53#issuecomment-99072949","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/53","id":99072949,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk5MDcyOTQ5","user":{"login":"amiara514","id":5551714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTE3MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5551714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514","html_url":"https://github.com/amiara514","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-05T13:04:54Z","updated_at":"2015-05-05T13:12:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Ah, I see.

(In other words, I didn't go looking for opportunities, I just took them when I happened to be \"in the neighborhood\" and saw them: there are plenty of more places, I think, to exercise lambda syntax).\n- A few places where I could determine clearly that a method or type was not in use anywhere in the codebase and that the functionality provided was either available elsewhere (typically in Guava) or constructable in Java 8 in an obvious \"one-liner\", I removed it.\n- Lastly, for a few types (notably 'MultiMap' and 'MultiSet') I happened to know that excellent well-exercised Guava versions already existed, so I swapped them out and toasted the Jena versions.\n\nTo your specific points:\n- `oaj.atlas.lib.Closeable`:  I clearly misunderstood the semantics of this type. I thought it was simply a narrowing of `java.io.Closeable` to disallow checked exceptions, so that the additional warnings would be a _good_ thing. Since it is independent, I will remove the new relationship: would it not also make sense to add some kind of comment explaining the particular semantics on oaj.a.l.Closeable`? I have to admit, I didn't look at it twice before thinking \"try-with-resources\".\n- `NodeTransform` I will put it back in in the optimizer. If I understand you correctly, the type itself should be declared inside oaj.sparql and used only there, yes?\n- Ah, I completely forgot about `@deprecated`. Just plain forgetfulness. I'll get those comments tagged correctly.  \n\nShall I make these changes, and then we can figure out how to parcel this stuff out into reasonable commits?\n\nJENA-931\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/99085428/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/99096043","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/53#issuecomment-99096043","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/53","id":99096043,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk5MDk2MDQz","user":{"login":"osma","id":1132830,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzI4MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1132830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma","html_url":"https://github.com/osma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-05T14:32:25Z","updated_at":"2015-05-05T14:32:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"[copying from the email I sent to the dev list, apparently the bot didn't notice my message]\n\nThanks a lot Chris, this was indeed very useful!

And I see you have also added some tests. Excellent!\n\nFor the tests, I think you could add a few more test cases (especially TestDatasetWithLuceneMultilingualTextIndex seems incomplete). For example, checking that a query for the German word \"Gift\" (meaning poison) doesn't match the English word \"gift\", as it would with the standard analyzer. Also you could check that at least some of the language-specific stemming rules work with the multilingual index, just like you have already tested for book/books in TestDatasetWithLocalizedAnalyzer.\n\nAbout the implementation of multilingual indexes: You have now made a separate Lucene index for each language. This is a valid solution, but have you considered instead using a single index with an extra field \"lang\" or \"language\" that would store the language of the indexed literal? Then at query time you could simply add an extra parameter to all queries restricting the lookup to a particular language. That might give simpler code and/or a more compact index in some cases. The analyzer would still be selected based on the language, of course.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/100212921/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/100894301","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/57#issuecomment-100894301","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/57","id":100894301,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwMDg5NDMwMQ==","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-11T12:44:45Z","updated_at":"2015-05-11T12:44:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I
