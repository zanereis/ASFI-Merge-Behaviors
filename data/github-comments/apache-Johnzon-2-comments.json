So you reject my code for something that the original code already fails with?\r\n\r\nAnyways, as I wrote above I had to _explicitly_ refer to this strategy using `@JsonVisibility` on a POJO to work around *another* bug of Johnzon:\r\n```java\r\n@JsonVisibility(DefaultPropertyVisibilityStrategy.class)\r\npublic final class C\r\n{\r\n   @JsonProperty private boolean foo;\r\n\r\n   public final boolean isFoo() { return foo; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n*Without* `@JsonVisibility` the POJO's field `foo` is **never** written on JSON parsing but stays `false` forever. Making it `public` would work around that, but is not intended. I *want* to keep it `private` as it shall be immutable by Java code, while JSON-B *still shall* modify it.\r\n\r\nI debugged this, and noticed that Johnzon actually knows that it *wants* to use the getter method + the field writer as accessors, but actually just doesn't invoke the field writer when it comes to parsing JSON. Had no time to debug it deeper, that's why I didn't report *that* first.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/johnzon/issues/comments/532612164/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/johnzon/issues/comments/532618792","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/johnzon/pull/44#issuecomment-532618792","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/johnzon/issues/44","id":532618792,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMjYxODc5Mg==","user":{"login":"rmannibucau","id":1249546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDk1NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1249546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau","html_url":"https://github.com/rmannibucau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-18T10:11:50Z","updated_at":"2019-09-18T10:11:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mkarg == enable to subclass the method and keep it working/handlable (I agree it requires a threadlocal which is ugly but once again this class must never be used in user code), instanceof breaks that directly bypassing subclass logic all the time.

I checked the logs again, and you are right, apparently we worked roughtly in parallel on that issue and pushed just minutes in sequence. It seems we both were too eagerly hacking code; we should more clearly put markers in the JIRA when we start on an issue. (Unfortunately we cannot use the JIRA assignee feature as only committers can be set there).\r\n\r\nRegarding the outcome of our dispute: As not being paid for this actually I do care **a lot** about credits on all the open source work I did in the past 20+ years. As we both worked on the same issue actually, my proposal would be to drop your commit, and accept my PR, and put your commit ontop of it. So both solutions are mentioned correctly. I think this would be most fair to both of us. Again, sorry for the confusion.\r\n\r\nRegarding Travis itself, I just fixed it in the first place solely because it kept sending me error messages. I do not _rely_ on the outcome. On the other hand, as it is fixed now, why should we drop it? It comes in really handy actually (I'm used to it from other open source projects, like JAX-RS, where we actually rely on it by blocking Github Merge button).

Thanks for that! Unfortunately I gotta go away for few hours (hopefully will continue later this night).

Hence the provider is Johnzon-only. If this is intended, I will add a note in the JavaDocs.\r\n* Shall we really compare exception message text? That's pretty ugly. I'd prefer to actually link the code with JSON-P and catch `NothingToRead` class.\r\n* A MBR is still an MBR, hence a JAX-RS component, hence should comply with its rules.

As announced, I added a warning to the JavaDocs that this will only work with Johnzon JSON-P -- which I assume is 100% of the use cases of this MBR.\r\n\r\nRegarding your ideas about JAX-RS I have a different view. As a long-time member of the JAX-RS team (I  had been an external advisor to JSR 311, expert group member of JSR 339 and JSR 370; now committer to Jakarta REST and publisher of JAX-RS 2.1.1 through 2.1.5) I need to tell you that this part of the JAX-RS spec actually makes *pretty much* sense. `NoContentException` can be catched by a `ReaderInterceptor`, so *the application programmer* can detect this special case and e. g. replace that exception by an entity of *his* choice, *before* the JAX-RS engine chimes in and turns the result into a `400 Bad Request`. There *are* existing applications where processing empty input streams *does* make sense, so this feature is *needed*. That \"synthetic\" empty entity will be propagated *to resouce methods* for regular processing of the request. This works independently of the used MBR, MIME type, and entity class. If you simply throw some MBR- or MIME-type-specific exception, the application programmer has no chance to do exactly that, as it will get propagated directly to the exception mapper, leading to 400 always -- without *any* chance for the application programmer to override this behavior. We *deliberately* introduced this interception possibility for this special case in JAX-RS 2.1. If you are unlucky with our decisions or spec, please open an issue with [our tracker on Github](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jaxrs-api/issues). We are happy to explain our features, and why we invented them. :-)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/johnzon/issues/comments/536227824/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/johnzon/issues/comments/536268159","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/johnzon/pull/52#issuecomment-536268159","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/johnzon/issues/52","id":536268159,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNjI2ODE1OQ==","user":{"login":"rmannibucau","id":1249546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDk1NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1249546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau","html_url":"https://github.com/rmannibucau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-29T08:20:50Z","updated_at":"2019-09-29T08:20:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi Markus\r\n\r\nThe warning is not needed except for jsonb provider, pkease remove it from other mbr\r\n\r\nAlso dont catch a johnzoncore exception since we can switch jsonp impl (as explained earlier)\r\nReally think the mapper is saner and will reach your goal to support all MBR\r\n\r\nAlso i opened https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jaxrs-api/issues/798 since this is a spec regression (so exception mapper will enable to get back the old behavior for end users without a toggle)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/johnzon/issues/comments/536268159/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/johnzon/issues/comments/536273667","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/johnzon/pull/52#issuecomment-536273667","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/johnzon/issues/52","id":536273667,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNjI3MzY2Nw==","user":{"login":"mkarg","id":1701815,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDE4MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1701815?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkarg","html_url":"https://github.com/mkarg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkarg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkarg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkarg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkarg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkarg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkarg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkarg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkarg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkarg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-29T09:24:06Z","updated_at":"2019-09-29T09:24:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rmannibucau This is the point where I need to chime out.

JAX-RS 2.1 and JAX-RS 2.0 *are* fully backwards compatible in the sense that an application written against JAX-RS 1.1 works 100% the same on JAX-RS 2.0. Nothing breaks here, but see, there is reason why 2.0 was not simply named 1.2: Once you write a component for JAX-RS 2.x, the rules have changed, and you need to follow the new rules. And the resulting component can *only* be used by application that also follow these new rules *or stick with JAX-RS 1.x*. There is *no* guarantee in Java EE that *no changes at all* are needed, for example see CMP (Container Managed Persistency): It was simply dropped in favor of JPA, which enforced a *massive* overhaul of existing applications back then, and it broke *all* existing applications. JAX-RS 2.0 and 2.1 passed all levels of the JCP process and finally were published as official standards everbody need to follow to claim compliance. Even if you personally think this was a wrong decision by everybody involved in the standardization process, there will not be a change in the interpretation of the existing spec, only the possibility to change it in an upcoming spec (you are invited to participate in that). Also \"period\" ;-). BTW, it is fine if you add an option to Johnzon's MBRs that explicitly switch off JAX-RS compliance to keep backwards compatibility. We often have this situation that bugs or incompliances have to be kept, and you could follow that path, even if it means that an existing JAX-RS application has to set a Johnzon-specific config option in its bootsrap, it would be a possible solution.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/johnzon/issues/comments/536305398/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/johnzon/issues/comments/536305810","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/johnzon/pull/52#issuecomment-536305810","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/johnzon/issues/52","id":536305810,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNjMwNTgxMA==","user":{"login":"mkarg","id":1701815,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDE4MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1701815?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkarg","html_url":"https://github.com/mkarg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkarg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkarg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkarg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkarg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkarg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkarg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkarg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkarg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkarg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-29T14:20:35Z","updated_at":"2019-09-29T14:20:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rmannibucau Your assumption is wrong.
