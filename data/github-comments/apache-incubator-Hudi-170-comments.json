Deletes on the same file will be consolidated into 1 re-writing. I highlight the worst case to show this can be slow compare to your inserts which have no re-writing at all. So this is expected in COW table. If you have perf concern on this, try convert to MOR where updates/deletes will be appended in log files. And if you configure async compaction to run, then there is no write amplification on ingestion. Also i think you may consider partitioning on immutable fields to avoid records jumping over partitions. Or near-immutable, as occasional partition updates are totally fine to cope with.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/968090220/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/968093165","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/3963#issuecomment-968093165","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3963","id":968093165,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM45s-3t","user":{"login":"xushiyan","id":2701446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDE0NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2701446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan","html_url":"https://github.com/xushiyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-13T16:15:57Z","updated_at":"2021-11-13T16:15:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> but no data insert into table\r\n\r\nYou meant no parquet file written at all?\r\n> 94684 [main] INFO  org.apache.hudi.io.HoodieMergeHandle  - Merging new data into oldPath /home/work/hudi_catalog4/2020/01/03/158308ae-8ac1-474c-85bc-6f0c4f88243d-0_0-0-0_20211111203048.parquet, as newPath /home/work/hudi_catalog4/2020/01/03/158308ae-8ac1-474c-85bc-6f0c4f88243d-0_0-0-0_20211112071954.parquet\r\n\r\nThe log showed some files written.

At the same time, the compact configuration item was set as 'NUM_COMMITS' . As a result of the setting, the old `CompactionTriggerStrategy` would judge the state without instantTime parameters. The new `CompactionTriggerStrategy` will use both instantTime and commitNumber parameters to judge the state  on the contrary, which is the reason why the old  `CompactionTriggerStrategy` could be successful but new `CompactionTriggerStrategy` would be unsuccessful.

@nsivabalan, I've fixed all comments. The main changes are:\r\n1. Unify bucket index configurations to the HoodieIndexConfig\r\n2. On the premise that bucket index key has to be the subset of the record key, get the index key value at the runtime from HoodieKey by a tricky way without destroying the data structure. `BucketIdentifier` is introduced to do it.\r\n3. When `tag location`, cache the partial filesystem view in each Spark task. The implementation is different from bloom index which caches hoodie key and file name first and then join with the input data. Bucket Index is proposed to processing more bigger data and join is a heavy operation. Therefore, hoodieRecordRDD to taggedRecordRDD is a mapPartition only operation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/968469713/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/968475200","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/3982#issuecomment-968475200","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3982","id":968475200,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM45ucJA","user":{"login":"lubo212","id":26039470,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDM5NDcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26039470?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lubo212","html_url":"https://github.com/lubo212","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lubo212/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lubo212/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lubo212/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lubo212/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lubo212/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lubo212/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lubo212/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lubo212/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lubo212/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-15T02:52:38Z","updated_at":"2021-11-15T02:52:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vinothchandar  can you help to approval?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/968475200/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/968498473","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/3920#issuecomment-968498473","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3920","id":968498473,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM45uh0p","user":{"login":"zhangyue19921010","id":69956021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5OTU2MDIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69956021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010","html_url":"https://github.com/zhangyue19921010","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-15T03:12:21Z","updated_at":"2021-11-15T03:12:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @leesf Thanks a lot for your review!

thanks for the feedback ~\r\n\r\nThe type1 error is really weird, if you dig into the code you will find that the target instant time just comes from the source, https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/3c4319729c7b5ae1ae39e46bd0ac3451fa1df032/hudi-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/common/table/timeline/HoodieActiveTimeline.java#L326, so the validation expects to pass.\r\n\r\nThe type2 error seems caused by in-correct rollback behavior, it seems that the previous failure compaction does not rollback successfully. \r\n\r\nThe type3 error is normal, the server does not sync as latest updated.\r\n\r\nI found that your compaction parallelism is set as `1` by option `compaction.tasks`, you can increase the parallelism, it seems that your compaction resource is not

The main changes are:\r\n> \r\n> 1. Unify bucket index configurations to the HoodieIndexConfig\r\n> 2. On the premise that bucket index key has to be the subset of the record key, get the index key value at the runtime from HoodieKey by a tricky way without destroying the data structure. `BucketIdentifier` is introduced to do it.\r\n> 3. When `tag location`, cache the partial filesystem view in each Spark task. The implementation is different from bloom index which caches hoodie key and file name first and then join with the input data. Bucket Index is proposed to processing more bigger data and join is a heavy operation. Therefore, hoodieRecordRDD to taggedRecordRDD is a mapPartition only operation.\r\n\r\nfriendly ping @nsivabalan,  could you please take a look in your spare time?
