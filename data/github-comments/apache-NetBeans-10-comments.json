There is some package missing, or something. And it turns red, if the plugin is opened. Just want to fix that.\r\n\r\n* This computation of the `count` variable indeed looks really awkward. What exactly is getting computed?\r\n\r\n  ```java\r\n  {\r\n      int count = COMMIT_STEPS + commits.size() * COMMIT_STEPS + 1;\r\n      fireProgressListenerStart(0, count);\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  The `fireProgressListenerStep()` method is getting called at line 117 and 163. Once in a loop over items in the `internalList` member variable, and once at the end of a try block. There seems to be no connection to the call of `commits.size()` in the code listing above. So, this part might be corrupted?\r\n\r\n* Using lambda expressions is an elegant way to streamline code. Before change, there were two private functions in place, which were both called just once. It not only clutters the navigator window, it also distracts attention away from the requirements.\r\n\r\n* Thank you for mentioning `Stream.of(...)`.\r\n\r\n* Doctor, can you please help me? The people say, I'm an idiot, and they are constantly laughing at me.\r\n\r\nOrder of maw means breakfast. I had toast, honey and milk. And a nice girl was talking to me meanwhile.

I need to reverse some of PR174, so that the template text file exist in `projectui` project instead of `apisupport.ant` project. \r\n\r\nI also need to understand why you turn the header into a Javadoc comment:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<#if licenseFirst??>\r\n    <#if licenseFirst == \"/*\">\r\n        <#assign licenseFirst=\"/**\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee [NETBEANS-161](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NETBEANS-161). Or do I misunderstand what that lingo means?  I think it may be due to the fact that you made your PR in October and probably modeled after the then current state of affairs. It was in November that we realized that we had done a mistake on all Apache NetBeans source files and reversed that in [PR282](https://github.com/apache/incubator-netbeans/pull/282).\r\n\r\nOther than that I know what I need to do to get the best of both. :-)\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/357508492/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/357508798","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/367#issuecomment-357508798","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/367","id":357508798,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NzUwODc5OA==","user":{"login":"junichi11","id":738383,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczODM4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/738383?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11","html_url":"https://github.com/junichi11","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-14T12:34:09Z","updated_at":"2018-01-14T12:34:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> See NETBEANS-161.\r\n\r\n@lbruun I know it :) See #288 \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/357508798/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/357508824","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/367#issuecomment-357508824","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/367","id":357508824,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NzUwODgyNA==","user":{"login":"lbruun","id":32431476,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDMxNDc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32431476?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbruun","html_url":"https://github.com/lbruun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbruun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbruun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbruun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbruun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbruun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbruun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbruun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbruun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbruun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-14T12:34:36Z","updated_at":"2018-01-14T12:34:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Apologies.

Gentoo has its own Java build system that handles dependency resolution and the like. There was ant integration but it was complex and required python xml re-rewriters to correct/adjust source/target/release/classpath entries in build.xml and properties files. But that its not always done consistently. The previous package for Gentoo using ant built jars of varying source/target. It could not build them all at a given source/target/release which is what the Gentoo java systems is designed to do. I just reduced stuff to a simple javac type function via a Bash function library on Gentoo called eclasses. That is what handles the build.\r\n\r\nSo yes I have it building and running entirely under JDK 9, and soon JDK 10. But I am not using ant or the build system. It was to cumbersome. I tried going that route but was getting no where. Plus I wanted to use system jars for external stuff, also built from source under JDK 9. The external binaries and hashes from those were causing lots of problems using ant. I was having to modify to many things. This way I am just not using all that stuff, and not modifying code etc really.\r\n\r\nI can see about modifying the ant build.xml files and sources to build under jdk9. I was going that route at first, but it will not be for my needs just general Netbeans building.
