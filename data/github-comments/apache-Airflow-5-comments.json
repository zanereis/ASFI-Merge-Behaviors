Branching is a great feature, but with branching often comes joining. The legs of the branch could be different lengths. Currently, you set all descendants to \"Skipped\", but perhaps the code can be changed to set only those descendants to Skipped that do not join with a Non-skipped branch. In other words, we would need to set descendants to skipped until we come across a node that has multiple parents and one of those parents is not skipped. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/123987024/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/123987301","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/167#issuecomment-123987301","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/167","id":123987301,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyMzk4NzMwMQ==","user":{"login":"r39132","id":581734,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MTczNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/581734?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132","html_url":"https://github.com/r39132","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-23T06:06:19Z","updated_at":"2015-07-23T23:40:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"BTW, I was not able to follow your FooOperator example.

Folks!\nI've changed the title of this issue to `Support a JoinPythonOperator to Work with the BranchPythonOperator Already Supported`. Prior to the creation of the BranchPythonOperator, we had ability to execute DAGs containing \"diamond\" topologies. With the advent and use of the BranchPythonOperator, we lost that ability, since every downstream node is labeled as `skipped`. I think the support of branching sets Airflow apart from other workflow engines, but it does require support for joining, as shown above. If this were available I would use it instead of the 'if-else' templating method, which I feel is less elegant.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/124784737/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/124854712","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/170#issuecomment-124854712","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/170","id":124854712,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNDg1NDcxMg==","user":{"login":"r39132","id":581734,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MTczNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/581734?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132","html_url":"https://github.com/r39132","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-25T15:50:27Z","updated_at":"2015-07-25T15:50:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/124854712/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/124886928","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/183#issuecomment-124886928","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/183","id":124886928,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNDg4NjkyOA==","user":{"login":"syvineckruyk","id":335167,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNTE2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/335167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/syvineckruyk","html_url":"https://github.com/syvineckruyk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syvineckruyk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syvineckruyk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syvineckruyk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syvineckruyk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syvineckruyk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syvineckruyk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syvineckruyk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syvineckruyk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syvineckruyk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-25T20:28:42Z","updated_at":"2015-07-25T20:28:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mistercrunch found an issue which I need to resolve before moving on this PR ...

need a few use cases to understand what everyone is trying to achieve with this feature. \n\nIt seems fairly straightforward to publish a message for a task downstream and have that task downstream pick it up, and bring it up into its context (making it available in the operator's `execute` method as well as in the templates). \n\nIt's also safe to assume that the message could be a \"pickleabe\" python object of limited size (probably smaller than 1MB). Right?\n\nThe question is how would the message be published? Is it an operator feature or a task feature? By that I mean is it baked into an operator, or is it baked when creating the task? \n\nLet's assume it's a task level feature. What if we had a parameter of `BaseOperator` called `drop_message` that expects a callable and calls it back after executing the task, passing it the context. Whatever is returned by that callable gets serialized and put into the database, and associated with that task instance. Downstream tasks can specify a `read_message`, most likely as a list of references to upstream tasks it's expecting messages from. These messages are made available in the context.

I haven't looked at the Tableau APIs lately.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/125833591/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/125834796","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/191#issuecomment-125834796","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/191","id":125834796,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNTgzNDc5Ng==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-29T04:24:20Z","updated_at":"2015-07-29T04:24:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Glad to hear it's working now.
