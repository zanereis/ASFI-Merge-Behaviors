I think I finally found the bug, the problem was that in Flink the `TypeComparator.compare` and `TypeComparator.compareToReference` have a strange quirk. If the first returns -1 the second must return 1 and vice versa. Your program should run fine now, could you please verify?\n\n@dhalperi As @tgroh suggested I'll still have to write a custom deterministic coder for the `Key` and also change the `PAssert` to use `Coder.structuralValue`, not sure yet how to do the second one properly.\n\nI asked about how to do that but I think the comment is hidden now because I force pushed some new changes. This was the comment:\n\nWhat would that look like with a PAssert?\n\nWhat I would do is write a SerializableFunction<Iterable<KV<Key, Long>>, Void> that contains the list of expected keys. Then I would use Iterables.transform() to transform both the expected and actual values to structural values and Iterables.elementsEqual() to verify. It seems a bit clumsy but is that the way to go here?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/224338548/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/224342933","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/369#issuecomment-224342933","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/369","id":224342933,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNDM0MjkzMw==","user":{"login":"dhalperi","id":526415,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNjQxNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/526415?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi","html_url":"https://github.com/dhalperi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-07T16:50:53Z","updated_at":"2016-06-07T16:50:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Pei: status?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/224342933/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/224354463","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/409#issuecomment-224354463","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/409","id":224354463,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNDM1NDQ2Mw==","user":{"login":"tgroh","id":429866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/429866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh","html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-07T17:31:37Z","updated_at":"2016-06-07T17:31:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Coder.structuralValue has a default implementation, so that bit is fairly simple; for the PAssert, I think the SerializableFunction plan is correct (especially given the conversion from real object -> structural value is a one-liner)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/224354463/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/224356040","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/369#issuecomment-224356040","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/369","id":224356040,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNDM1NjA0MA==","user":{"login":"peihe","id":10201797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjAxNzk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10201797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peihe","html_url":"https://github.com/peihe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peihe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peihe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peihe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peihe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peihe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peihe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peihe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peihe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peihe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-07T17:37:02Z","updated_at":"2016-06-07T17:37:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think you are referring to the executing project bug.

Should I move this to a separate test file or leave it in `GroupByKeyTest`, what do you think @francesperry, since you suggested I move it to `GroupByKeyTest`?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/224503457/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/224508172","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/431#issuecomment-224508172","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/431","id":224508172,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNDUwODE3Mg==","user":{"login":"dhalperi","id":526415,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNjQxNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/526415?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi","html_url":"https://github.com/dhalperi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-08T07:13:54Z","updated_at":"2016-06-08T07:13:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Confirmed via `mvn verify` that the jars now have Guava shaded and repackaged properly.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/224508172/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/224527718","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/430#issuecomment-224527718","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/430","id":224527718,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNDUyNzcxOA==","user":{"login":"mxm","id":837221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNzIyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/837221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm","html_url":"https://github.com/mxm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-08T08:48:10Z","updated_at":"2016-06-08T08:48:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks!
