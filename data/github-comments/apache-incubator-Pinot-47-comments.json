Unless these are measured, there isn't a way to guarantee them, right? Once the numbers are available, Pinot operators can make appropriate changes to improve the system.\r\n\r\nWhat I meant is the name SLOConfig gives the impression that we will guarantee the latency somehow. Its like qps or quota config. My suggestion is to rename the config to something like log_slow_queries and slow_query_threshold. MySQL provides some config variables like this.\r\n \r\n> Client side measurements include noise (network and other client side induced latency) and are not reliable measures.\r\n\r\nI was referring to pinot client. Typically, network issues are also part of the SLA.\r\n\r\n> The config helps emit the base metrics that are can be reliably used in measuring availability numbers from server side. Many services at LinkedIn use server side measurements - we have been emitting these currently from the broker using Jetty/container configs - but they make per table metrics harder to compute (as broker multi-tenancy is common).\r\n\r\nThat sounds good. Please rename SLOConfig to something else.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/513860442/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/513872212","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/4230#issuecomment-513872212","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/4230","id":513872212,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMzg3MjIxMg==","user":{"login":"kishoreg","id":850791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg","html_url":"https://github.com/kishoreg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-22T17:12:36Z","updated_at":"2019-07-22T17:12:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@icefury71 Good questions.

@snleee , @mcvsubbu for reviewing and approving the changes.\r\n\r\nSome follow up items I will address in upcoming PRs:\r\n\r\n1. Revisit the logic where we fetch the ideal state again and recompute the target. There is potential room for optimization here  -- fetch the ideal state again and recompute target only if we previously failed to write in ZK due to version mismatch.\r\n\r\n2. For the rest api based access that runs rebalance in async mode, we need to show which controller is responding to the rebalance request.\r\n\r\n3. Re-use the recently merged controller test apis in the integration test to start/stop fake servers.\r\n\r\n4.

information.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/517390893/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/517419609","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/4488#issuecomment-517419609","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/4488","id":517419609,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNzQxOTYwOQ==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-01T19:11:22Z","updated_at":"2019-08-01T19:11:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#
