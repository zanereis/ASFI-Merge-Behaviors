that.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/570200056/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/570201904","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/4163#issuecomment-570201904","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/4163","id":570201904,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MDIwMTkwNA==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-02T13:06:41Z","updated_at":"2020-01-02T13:06:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#

The data is displayed according to the average value of the indicator data in the specified time period. The average value can reflect the average performance over a period of time, but it is easily affected by the extreme value. For example, a user visiting the network is very poor, resulting in the overall page load is very slow, and the average value of the data will be directly pulled up. So I think we can do a filter and use the filter of extremum to remove the extremum and avoid the influence of extremum on the overall trend of performance.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/570454506/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/570470451","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/4166#issuecomment-570470451","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/4166","id":570470451,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MDQ3MDQ1MQ==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-03T05:48:20Z","updated_at":"2020-01-03T05:48:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@Fine0830
