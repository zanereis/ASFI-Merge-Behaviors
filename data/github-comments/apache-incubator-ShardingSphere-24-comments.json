I finally understand your point.\r\n\r\nIt does not support this feature when your use same column to sharding datasources and tables.\r\n\r\nBecause sharding algorithm of databases and tables are unrelated. If you want let table sharding result related data source sharding result, we have to change the API of sharding algorithm, merge table sharding algorithm and data source sharding algorithm as one, and return data node list. \r\n\r\nIt is hard to understand for end users, so we still use simple one to make config easy, but maybe cause more useless database

No, it is not a good idea. The exception is thrown from BoneCP, because BoneCP don't permit user sent null value for `configFile`. \r\nBut maybe other database pools can support null value as well.\r\nSkip null value is `NOT` Sharding-Sphere's responsibility, sent the original value to target data source pool is the best way here.\r\n\r\nChange the original behavior is bad practice. Sharding-Sphere `JUST` handle for distribute, it is not  a database combo.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/421320687/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/421322535","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/1260#issuecomment-421322535","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/1260","id":421322535,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMTMyMjUzNQ==","user":{"login":"terrymanu","id":5516298,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTYyOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5516298?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu","html_url":"https://github.com/terrymanu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-14T11:00:47Z","updated_at":"2018-09-14T11:00:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"`ShardingDataSource` is not a public API, the public API is only at api package. \r\nSo we may change internal codes anytime.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/421322535/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/421333144","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/1046#issuecomment-421333144","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/1046","id":421333144,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMTMzMzE0NA==","user":{"login":"beckhampu","id":14846369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODQ2MzY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14846369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beckhampu","html_url":"https://github.com/beckhampu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beckhampu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beckhampu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beckhampu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beckhampu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beckhampu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beckhampu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beckhampu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beckhampu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beckhampu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-14T11:42:26Z","updated_at":"2018-09-14T11:42:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Here are some coding details.\r\nAbout config loading:\r\n1、Load the 'config-*.yaml' file to get all the sharding rule configuration of schmal.\r\n2、Load the server.yaml file to get orchestration, proxyAuthority, and props configurations.\r\n3、Add new class ProxyContext.
