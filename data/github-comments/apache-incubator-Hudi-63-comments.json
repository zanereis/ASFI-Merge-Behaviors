If the user, wants to try another or their own version of Hudi they can drop their jars under `/usr/lib/hudi/` to replace existing ones.

Instead it gives complete control over what goes into each task partition, and we send only the file and its corresponding mapping (in our case `external data file`, and in this case `log file`) over to the task. It is the very use to **RDD** interface to have that kind of control over the datasource we are building.\r\n\r\nHappy to have more in-depth discussion on this and help get this to completion.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/643568699/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/643569262","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/1722#issuecomment-643569262","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1722","id":643569262,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MzU2OTI2Mg==","user":{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-13T04:49:56Z","updated_at":"2020-06-13T04:49:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for the detailed comments, @umehrot2 !

Move to RFC-15 once it was ready.\r\n- Broadcasting paths in option hashmap could cause performance issues.\r\nI am not sure if there is a better way to do this until RFC-15 is ready. Search log files from executors could be more expensive since it requires TableView and metaClient e.t.c. Even we have thousands of log files, the hashmap might be a few MBs, so I guess it could be ok? \r\n\r\nMajor follow-ups after this PR:\r\n- Incremental view on MOR table.\r\n- Vectorized reader\r\n- More efficient type conversion.\r\n- Support custom payload.\r\nThose four can be done in parallel but all depend on this PR. We can make a baseline in this PR and iterate through different topics in parallel.\r\nAlso, we can ask help from the community to test in their production for a very large dataset.

Understand the issue originates from `MetricRegistry` not allowing update value for existing metric. By the class design, it does enforce the immutable nature of it. A clean impl. could be to update `Gauge<T>` itself. I see `MetricsSource<T>` is wrapping the update logic to serve a similar purpose, which is fine.\r\n> \r\n> After some searching, I found that there is a recent upstream PR to implement the \"settable\" version of `Gauge`\r\n> [dropwizard/metrics#1599](https://github.com/dropwizard/metrics/pull/1599)\r\n> which seems to solve the problem right away.\r\n> \r\n> IMO we should wait for the upstream change and make small adjustment by using the `SettableGauge`. WDYT?\r\n\r\nI feel ok, but I’m not sure when it will be resolved.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/644594672/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/644595846","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/1716#issuecomment-644595846","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1716","id":644595846,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0NDU5NTg0Ng==","user":{"login":"lw309637554","id":8501994,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDE5OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8501994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw309637554","html_url":"https://github.com/lw309637554","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw309637554/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw309637554/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw309637554/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw309637554/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw309637554/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw309637554/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw309637554/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw309637554/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw309637554/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-16T07:48:17Z","updated_at":"2020-06-16T07:48:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vinothchandar What do you think about the updated PR ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/644595846/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/644680815","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/1728#issuecomment-644680815","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1728","id":644680815,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0NDY4MDgxNQ==","user":{"login":"harishchanderramesh","id":46951911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2OTUxOTEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46951911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harishchanderramesh","html_url":"https://github.com/harishchanderramesh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harishchanderramesh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harishchanderramesh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harishchanderramesh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harishchanderramesh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harishchanderramesh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harishchanderramesh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harishchanderramesh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harishchanderramesh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harishchanderramesh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-16T10:33:08Z","updated_at":"2020-06-16T10:37:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@bvaradar - Would like to know more if you are working on similar lines.\r\n\r\n@vinothchandar  - I was able to fix that by running on EMR 5.30 and hudi 0.5.2. there is no error that i see now.\r\nThe streaming batch completes and everything is fine, but the processing time increases slowly.\r\n\r\nLike you said, I changed the `.option(\"hoodie.index.type\",\"GLOBAL_BLOOM\") \\` to .option(\"hoodie.index.type\",\"BLOOM\") \\\r\n\r\nBut there was no improvement.\r\n\r\nLooking at the stages for each batch, the `count at HoodieSparkSqlWriter.scala:256` stage is the one causing the issue. the time taken for this stage has increased from 15 seconds to 36 seconds in a matter of 3 hours.\r\n\r\nFirstly i would like to understand what is happening at this stage and why this is so costly?
