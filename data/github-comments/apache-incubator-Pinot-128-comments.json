The way group by works right now relies on having a dictionary, and if we disable the dictionary then one will just be built on the fly in one of the slower group by implementations. Instead, automatic recommendation based on common queries will guide the user down the path of converting the column to a metric column if it's never used in a group by query. I'm ambivalent to the change for `FLOAT` and `DOUBLE`: recommendation should make this a solved problem, but the change makes sense for these types.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1077622836/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1077660529","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/8398#issuecomment-1077660529","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/8398","id":1077660529,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5AO8tx","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-24T14:00:34Z","updated_at":"2022-04-06T03:41:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/8398?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) Report\n> Merging [#8398](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/8398?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (817a6f0) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/commit/b05a5419c88fd61450156189c8754d8c10614423?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (b05a541) will **increase** coverage by `0.09%`.\n> The diff coverage is `67.30%`.\n\n> :exclamation: Current head 817a6f0 differs from pull request most recent head 401488b.

People are not expected to group by on metrics.\r\n\r\nThat makes sense to me. \r\n\r\nI think there's more to this though. Total size isn't the only factor, but also density of the column for value scans. Let's say you have 10M unique doubles, which require 76MB in storage without a dictionary. The dictionary would require at least 76MB to store the values, but the column values would require ceil(log_2(10M)) = 24 bits per value, or ~29MB for the entire column. Let's say you are scanning for values in a range, you do two dictionary lookups to map the range bounds into the dictionary's domain, then scan 29MB of data instead of 76MB. Dictionary decoding is scalar but [can be explicitly vectorized](https://github.com/richardstartin/vectorbenchmarks/blob/master/src/main/java/com/openkappa/panama/vectorbenchmarks/DictionaryDecoding.java). You may or may not need to retrieve the values, so may even avoid decoding the values in the range, and the cost of decoding the dictionary ids depends on how many values are retrieved, and may or may not exceed the cost of scanning more data. So this is a decision which requires more inputs than just the relative sizes.

We should make the check more strict (e.g. check if min/max value exist) to ensure the segment metadata can be used to solve the query.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1079428775/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1079439498","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/8409#issuecomment-1079439498","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/8409","id":1079439498,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5AVvCK","user":{"login":"Jackie-Jiang","id":17555551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTU1NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17555551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang","html_url":"https://github.com/Jackie-Jiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-25T21:15:23Z","updated_at":"2022-03-25T21:15:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ideally, the check should happen on the broker side since it has access to the table schema, then we may add a string version aggregation (e.g. `StringMax`) to avoid the overhead of overloading `Max` to do non-numeric types. The challenge here is that for transform function, currently we cannot derive the result data type from the input data types.\r\n\r\nAnother approach is to change `Max` function to return an `Object` instead of `double`. It might involve overhead of storing boxed value, but the result can be of different types (e.g. return `Integer` for int columns instead of double). Currently the final result type must be fixed for aggregation function, so in order to make this change, we need to loose this restriction.

Also, in certain scenarios, the input data might already have the final column generated, and we just skip the transform. I would be super careful on this change because we need to ensure the record is never transformed twice. Another concern is that if the ingestion transform changes, there is no way to re-generate the derived column because the original values are already changed. IMO, loose this restriction can easily cause unexpected behavior, and might not worth it.\r\n\r\nThe problem that we are running into is that for GDPR etc., we need to be able to purge records from a segment based on values of a particular field and if we change the name of the field that is being ingested into Pinot, then we loose information that column 'x' in the Pinot table actually came from field 'y' in the Kafka event / avro schema and hence cannot purge records automatically based on orginal avro schema field name 'y' in minion.\r\n\r\nDefinitely open to suggestions and discussion, but my understanding is that ingestion transform functions are applied only during ingestion where the original field is in kafka/avro and the transformed value goes into Pinot column, so this should be safe right? If you have any particular usecase that may not be safe I can try them out?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1079489100/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1079496589","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/8413#issuecomment-1079496589","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/8413","id":1079496589,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5AV8-N","user":{"login":"Jackie-Jiang","id":17555551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTU1NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17555551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang","html_url":"https://github.com/Jackie-Jiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-25T22:46:17Z","updated_at":"2022-03-25T22:46:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> The problem that we are running into is that for GDPR etc., we need to be able to purge records from a segment based on values of a particular field and if we change the name of the field that is being ingested into Pinot, then we loose information that column 'x' in the Pinot table actually came from field 'y' in the Kafka event / avro schema and hence cannot purge records automatically based on orginal avro schema field name 'y' in minion.\r\n\r\nIf you transform the value within column 'x', even if you can find the column, the value is no longer the original value, how do you apply the purge logic?\r\nAlso, even if you can modify the value properly, when generating the new segment, it will use the record transformer to process the records again, which will cause the transform twice problem.

We can add default implementation of them by just scanning the `BlockDocIdIterator`, and override the filter operators that can accelerate this process.\r\n> \r\n> This way, all the single `COUNT` aggregation query can be solved with the short-circuited operator. Even if there is no special optimization for the filter (scan-based), we can still save the overhead of creating 10000 docs blocks.\r\n\r\nMakes sense. I will follow up with this.\r\n\r\n> Not sure how much extra optimization we can get from `BitmapCollection`, but that does add complexity to the logic, so I'd suggest first adding the basic `RoaringBitmap` one, then have a separate enhancement to compare their performance\r\n\r\nI'd prefer to keep it this way:\r\n\r\n* a lot of collective effort has gone in to the counting methods over the years and `BitmapCollection` just encapsulates them. \r\n* Implementing negation of a compressed bitmap by flipping its bits means you get a very dense bitmap, unless you already have a dense bitmap and you have incurred a sunk cost.\r\n* I don't anticipate it needing to change.\r\n* it has high test coverage if you are concerned about correctness.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1081007479/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1081008430","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/8422#issuecomment-1081008430","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/8422","id":1081008430,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5AbuEu","user":{"login":"jtao15","id":50065407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMDY1NDA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50065407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtao15","html_url":"https://github.com/jtao15","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtao15/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtao15/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtao15/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtao15/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtao15/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtao15/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtao15/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtao15/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtao15/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-28T18:40:56Z","updated_at":"2022-03-28T18:40:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jadami10 @jackjlli ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1081008430/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1081038136","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/8422#issuecomment-1081038136","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/8422","id":1081038136,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5Ab1U4","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-28T19:14:02Z","updated_at":"2022-03-31T04:40:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/8422?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) Report\n> Merging [#8422](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/8422?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (2a49295) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/commit/e2053f6776911dcce5f1ef1e32ed35063ca10bea?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (e2053f6) will **decrease** coverage by `44.77%`.\n> The diff coverage is `83.87%`.\n\n> :exclamation: Current head 2a49295 differs from pull request most recent head 55abe0b.

We can add default implementation of them by just scanning the `BlockDocIdIterator`, and override the filter operators that can accelerate this process.\r\n> \r\n> This way, all the single `COUNT` aggregation query can be solved with the short-circuited operator. Even if there is no special optimization for the filter (scan-based), we can still save the overhead of creating 10000 docs blocks.\r\n\r\nThis increases code complexity a lot, because it involves inlining a lot of code into operators. This will eventually improve efficiency but makes the surface area of the change much larger.\r\n\r\n I think the approach taken here is better because \r\n\r\n1. the operators aren't SPIs and can be removed at any time\r\n2. they allow incremental improvements, e.g. the ones in this PR. Extending the mechanism to some other operators is quite easy, and once all operators return true for the check methods, they can be removed.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1081131547/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1081206855","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/8422#issuecomment-1081206855","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/8422","id":1081206855,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5AcehH","user":{"login":"jtao15","id":50065407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMDY1NDA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50065407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtao15","html_url":"https://github.com/jtao15","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtao15/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtao15/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtao15/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtao15/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtao15/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtao15/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtao15/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtao15/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtao15/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-28T22:14:52Z","updated_at":"2022-03-28T22:14:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I feel this is not the correct fix. We should change the `computeIfAbsent()` to `compute()` to ensure the `addSegment()` is called within the `compute()` block.\r\n\r\nThis will make the addSegment() to be blocking? This may not be ideal because it will slow down the segment download on servers. Is it possible to do this async? We are considering two approaches:\r\n1. The current approach in this pr which tries to increase the segment count before `addSegment()`, and decrease the count if `addSegment()` fails in the middle.\r\n2. Another approach is to shutdown the tableDataManager in the background thread only if it's not active for a while. We can add `lastModifiedTime` whenever segmentDataManagerMap is updated and check both # of segments and `lastModifiedTime` to decide if shutdown is needed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1081206855/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1081210576","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/8426#issuecomment-1081210576","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/8426","id":1081210576,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5AcfbQ","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-28T22:19:53Z","updated_at":"2022-03-30T02:31:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/8426?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) Report\n> Merging [#8426](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/8426?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (48b300a) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/commit/dfc7ea8a91f0e5d1f99559f6b094d1ccc1dff5a4?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (dfc7ea8) will **increase** coverage by `1.26%`.\n> The diff coverage is `36.36%`.\n\n```diff\n@@             Coverage Diff              @@\n##             master    #8426      +/-   ##\n============================================\n+ Coverage     69.66%   70.92%   +1.26%     \n- Complexity     4238     4280      +42     \n============================================\n  Files          1629     1660      +31     \n  Lines         85140    87039    +1899     \n  Branches      12815    13140     +325     \n============================================\n+ Hits          59310    61734    +2424     \n+ Misses        21698    21044     -654     \n- Partials       4132     4261     +129     \n```\n\n| Flag | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| integration1 | `28.73% <0.00%> (-0.06%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| integration2 | `27.37% <0.00%> (?)` | |\n| unittests1 | `66.99% <36.36%> (+0.07%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| unittests2 | `14.19% <0.00%> (+0.08%)` | :arrow_up: |\n\nFlags with carried forward coverage won't be shown.

few points about enforcing invariants and preconditions came up in this review:\r\n* it would be nice to be able to assume SV bitmap indexes are disjoint, but they won't be in general because we will

REGEXP_LIKE) but we don't model this assumption. We can risk blowing up at runtime, or write potentially dead code, it isn't clear which at the call site.\r\n* What can we assume about an operator's structure? e.g. should an `AndFilterOperator` worry about having zero child filters? \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1082418102/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1082426754","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/8355#issuecomment-1082426754","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/8355","id":1082426754,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5AhIWC","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-29T22:21:48Z","updated_at":"2022-05-04T02:33:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/8355?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) Report\n> Merging [#8355](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/8355?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (795fa15) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/commit/b5690a7137a6b7e3313bc665104ff543b659992f?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (b5690a7) will **decrease** coverage by `0.19%`.\n> The diff coverage is `41.66%`.\n\n```diff\n@@             Coverage Diff              @@\n##             master    #8355      +/-   ##\n============================================\n- Coverage     70.47%   70.28%   -0.20%     \n- Complexity     4313     4409      +96     \n============================================\n  Files          1703     1718      +15     \n  Lines         89569    90597    +1028     \n  Branches      13564    13713     +149     \n============================================\n+ Hits          63123    63673     +550     \n- Misses        21990    22431     +441     \n- Partials       4456     4493      +37     \n```\n\n| Flag | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| integration1 | `26.81% <4.16%> (-0.36%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| integration2 | `25.45% <4.16%> (-0.06%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| unittests1 | `66.42% <0.00%> (-0.03%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| unittests2 | `13.98% <41.66%> (-0.09%)` | :arrow_down: |\n\nFlags with carried forward coverage won't be shown.
