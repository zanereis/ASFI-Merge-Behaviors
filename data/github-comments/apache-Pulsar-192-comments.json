I found a few problems for log compaction here:\r\n1. Fail for empty topics. This can be fixed by an additional check before compaction.\r\n2. Unable to finish the compaction if the value of the last message is empty when the compaction is triggered. This can be fixed by adding the missing check in the phase 2 of the compaction. Please notice that a message with an empty value indicates a [deletion](https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/en/concepts-topic-compaction/#how-topic-compaction-works) @pienio7 \r\n3. Fail for massive writes. This is a bit complicated, as the raw reader for compaction stops reading new messages after the first batch (100 entries) of raw messages(which may contain many more sub-messages), and increasing the timeout duration doesn't help. It seems there is something wrong with flow control here, and I have to do more test and analysis.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/13d8ecd20a3c6795405fbf5946c1907e9c90dd91/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/compaction/TwoPhaseCompactor.java#L106\r\n\r\nFor problem 3, I got the stats of the topic when the compaction stucks, and some metrics like `availablePermits`, `lastAckedTimestamp` seems to be anomalous here.  Maybe someone could provide some insight or advice based on these metrics and the problems described? @ivankelly @sijie \r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"msgRateIn\" : 311362.5386883373,\r\n  \"msgThroughputIn\" : 7316116.5272862585,\r\n  \"msgRateOut\" : 0.0,\r\n  \"msgThroughputOut\" : 0.0,\r\n  \"averageMsgSize\" : 23.497099420201696,\r\n  \"storageSize\" : 238074383,\r\n  \"backlogSize\" : 238074383,\r\n  \"publishers\" : [ {\r\n    \"msgRateIn\" : 311362.5386883373,\r\n    \"msgThroughputIn\" : 7316116.5272862585,\r\n    \"averageMsgSize\" : 23.0,\r\n    \"producerId\" : 0,\r\n    \"metadata\" : { },\r\n    \"address\" : \"/127.0.0.1:57444\",\r\n    \"producerName\" : \"standalone-1-3\",\r\n    \"connectedSince\" : \"2020-02-05T22:29:10.529+08:00\",\r\n    \"clientVersion\" : \"2.5.0\"\r\n  } ],\r\n  \"subscriptions\" : {\r\n    \"__compaction\" : {\r\n      \"msgRateOut\" : 0.0,\r\n      \"msgThroughputOut\" : 0.0,\r\n      \"msgRateRedeliver\" : 0.0,\r\n      \"msgBacklog\" : 11181,\r\n      \"blockedSubscriptionOnUnackedMsgs\" : false,\r\n      \"msgDelayed\" : 0,\r\n      \"unackedMessages\" : 40122,\r\n      \"type\" : \"Exclusive\",\r\n      \"activeConsumerName\" : \"3e96d\",\r\n      \"msgRateExpired\" : 0.0,\r\n      \"lastExpireTimestamp\" : 0,\r\n      \"lastConsumedFlowTimestamp\" : 1580912972315,\r\n      \"lastConsumedTimestamp\" : 1580912972386,\r\n      \"lastAckedTimestamp\" : 0,\r\n      \"consumers\" : [ {\r\n        \"msgRateOut\" : 0.0,\r\n        \"msgThroughputOut\" : 0.0,\r\n        \"msgRateRedeliver\" : 0.0,\r\n        \"consumerName\" : \"3e96d\",\r\n        \"availablePermits\" : -39122,\r\n        \"unackedMessages\" : 40122,\r\n        \"blockedConsumerOnUnackedMsgs\" : false,\r\n        \"lastAckedTimestamp\" : 0,\r\n        \"lastConsumedTimestamp\" : 1580912972386,\r\n        \"metadata\" : { },\r\n        \"address\" : \"/127.0.0.1:56969\",\r\n        \"connectedSince\" : \"2020-02-05T22:29:32.314+08:00\",\r\n        \"clientVersion\" : \"2.6.0-SNAPSHOT\"\r\n      } ],\r\n      \"isReplicated\" : false\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \"replication\" : { },\r\n  \"deduplicationStatus\" : \"Disabled\",\r\n  \"bytesInCounter\" : 238088065,\r\n  \"msgInCounter\" : 9985337\r\n}\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/582480075/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/582481709","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/6173#issuecomment-582481709","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/6173","id":582481709,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MjQ4MTcwOQ==","user":{"login":"KannarFr","id":7518245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MTgyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7518245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KannarFr","html_url":"https://github.com/KannarFr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KannarFr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KannarFr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KannarFr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KannarFr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KannarFr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KannarFr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KannarFr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KannarFr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KannarFr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-05T16:08:08Z","updated_at":"2020-02-05T16:08:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Another point, the log compaction is run on event, like foreach 100MB of data, right?

That says one permit per message. So broker decrementing the permits after it dispatched messages. It is okay to see negative \"permits\" at the broker side because it means that broker dispatched more messages that the consumer requested. \r\n\r\nHowever, it is NOT okay if the consumer counts the permits by batches. For example, a consumer/reader requests 100 permits (the receiver queue size), the broker dispatches 1000 \"messages\" (10 message per batch). Hence the \"permits\" at broker side will become -900. Since RawReaderImpl treats one permit per batch, it will request 50 permits again from the broker once the available permits at reader side reach the threshold (which is half of the receiver queue size).\r\n\r\nThe broker receives 50 permits and increases its available permits back to -850. But it is still negative. So broker will not read any more messages and cause raw reader to be stuck at waiting for new messages.\r\n\r\nThe problem of 3) can be addressed by fixing https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/402ecec9c3731711fd1bf700c30d09678aa9b1e5/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/client/impl/RawReaderImpl.java#L144 to use number of messages as permits.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBesides this problem, @codelipenghui has seen a lot of \"consumer stuck\" problems related to permits. We have been discussing how to introduce a self-healing mechanism into current flow-control logic to avoid similar mistakes in client implementation. I think we should discuss a more generic approach to improve flow-control after fixing this issue here.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/582524154/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/582601984","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/6231#issuecomment-582601984","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/6231","id":582601984,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MjYwMTk4NA==","user":{"login":"devinbost","id":7418031,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MTgwMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7418031?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost","html_url":"https://github.com/devinbost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-05T20:40:52Z","updated_at":"2020-02-05T20:40:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I

I would like to know if that's along the lines of what @sijie and @merlimat where suggesting. If it is, I intend to 1) add more extensive unit tests  2) add documentation. I have not implemented the _failover mode_, but it is taken into account by means of the `GroupMode` enum, which currently has the values `Exclusive` and `Parallel` only, but which I created so it can be extended by a `FailOver` value in the future.\r\n\r\nBtw I'm not totally happy using `IdentityHashSet`, but I haven't found any good discriminator so far that I can use in order to put multiple producers - which are currently considered `equals()` if producerName and topic are equal - into the same producer group `Set`. I considered `cnx.clientAddress()`, which should work in reality, but did not work with the simple unit tests I tried (where the `clientAddress` is the same for multiple producers) will look into that again.

Sure I can help verify. \r\n\r\nJust to make sure I fully understand how it's _supposed_ to work:\r\n\r\n**Background**\r\nI was trying to set up Pulsar with EKS, simply following the instructions in [\"Deploying Pulsar on Kubernetes\"](https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/v1.22.0-incubating/deployment/Kubernetes/).\r\nFor that purpose I cloned the Pulsar repo and copied the source files from `deployment/kubernetes/aws`. At that time, the `.yaml` files had the `PULSAR_PREFIX_` introducing most of the properties in the `ConfigMap`.\r\nFrom the [apply-config-from-env.py](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/docker/pulsar/scripts/apply-config-from-env.py) script, I inferred that the script wouldn't apply the settings to properties that were _already set_ in the relevant config file (in the Docker container). Because of the prefix.\r\nGiven that constellation, you would have to\r\n- omit the prefix for properties already defined in the config,\r\n- add the prefix for new properties absent from the config. \r\n\r\n**Recent Changes**\r\nLooking at the history of, say `bookkeeper.yaml`, I see that the prefix was added consistently in `d74c1acb` (#5790) and removed again in `d631156d` (Issue #6192).  \r\n\r\nNothing changed in  [apply-config-from-env.py](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/docker/pulsar/scripts/apply-config-from-env.py). So I still need to add the prefix to set properties that aren't preconfigured in the config file.\r\n\r\n**Question**\r\nWhy treat existing keys and new keys differently in the first place?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/583382637/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/583484942","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/6241#issuecomment-583484942","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/6241","id":583484942,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MzQ4NDk0Mg==","user":{"login":"codelipenghui","id":12592133,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTkyMTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12592133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui","html_url":"https://github.com/codelipenghui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-07T16:29:52Z","updated_at":"2020-02-07T16:29:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@sijie
