The pom is specifying ver 3.4.  If that's intentional can a clarification as to why not 3.6 be added to the file and as well as an annotation to squelch the warning: `<version>3.4</version><!--$NO-MVN-MAN-VER$-->`.

The answers :\n\n\n   - Why create two classes (RabbitmqConsumer and RabbitmqProducer), here I\n   followed Kafka connector and they should not share the same rabbitmq\n   connection and channel. I also answered in that disscuss mail about naming\n   style\n   - About the RabbitmqConfigKeyConstants : the reason is the rabbitmq\n   client need many config arguments, I also followed the Kafka connector used\n   a Map<String, Object> as the argument box. I think we should not expose the\n   RabbitMQ client's ConnectionFactory expose to user, it's not safety  and\n   user will need more knowledge about RabbitMQ's client. For there many\n   arguments, the *builder pattern* would be better.\n   - The RabbitMQ client can handle the connection failure and specific\n   problem with *enable recovery* and *recovery interval* setting.\n   - The same as Kafka it do not support automated tests. I have done the\n   test. If anyone want to run the test case, the rabbitmq server should be\n   started manually. All the description (about installation and launch steps)\n   I have written in the test class. And there is no public rabbitmq server\n   could be used as test server.\n   - Yes,  the usage of this connector should be added to samples\n   collection, I will do this in the future.\n\nVino yang\nThanks.\n\n\n2018-03-23 3:13 GMT+08:00 Dale LaBossiere <notifications@github.com>:\n\n> I know this has already been merged.
