\r\nI compared this PR with the original commit and it looks good. Just a couple of minor questions\r\n1. This change to model.hpp was not reverted. It looks like it's not related to minibatch but just wanted to confirm it with you\r\n```\r\n-        for (k = 1; k <= N; k ++) {\r\n-            u.push_back(Eigen::Map<Matrix >(\r\n-                    const_cast<double*>(data + sizeOfU),\r\n-                    n[k-1] + 1, n[k]));\r\n-            sizeOfU += (n[k-1] + 1) * (n[k]);\r\n+        for (k = 0; k < N; k ++) {\r\n+            // u.push_back(Eigen::Map<Matrix >(\r\n+            //     const_cast<double*>(data + sizeOfU),\r\n+            //     n[k] + 1, n[k+1]));\r\n+            u.push_back(MutableMappedMatrix());\r\n+            u[k].rebind(const_cast<double *>(data + sizeOfU), n[k] + 1, n[k+1]);\r\n+            sizeOfU += (n[k] + 1) * (n[k+1]);\r\n```\r\n2. A function named `initialize` was added to model.hpp but I didn't see it getting used anywhere. Should this be reverted as well ?\r\n\r\nI also cherry picked this revert commit on top of the mlp minibatch branch `mlp-minibatch-with-preprocessed-data-rebased` and successfully ran install check for svm and mlp with greenplum.

\r\nYes, both those changes are related to MLP and ideally should have been in a different commit. We can still make it that way by reverting them here and then reintroducing these changes. \r\n\r\nThe `1.` is for not copying the coefficients every time we rebind and `2.` is for moving the coefficient initialization from python to c++, since the model is a c++ variable. They're both optimizations not necessarily required immediately. \r\n\r\nMy suggestion is that we keep the changes here and avoid a redundant commit. We've another task of fixing MLP's initialization (jira pending) - as part of that ticket we can also utilize the `initialize` function. What do you think?
