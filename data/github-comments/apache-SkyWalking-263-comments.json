Often the local execution of the development environment can only get a rough result. At this time, the result is executed on a specific server in the form of jar. It may be more precise, but I can't customize a certain test, so I can only run all of them.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/962536551/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/962537544","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/7985#issuecomment-962537544","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/7985","id":962537544,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArmls845XyhI","user":{"login":"kezhenxu94","id":15965696,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTY1Njk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15965696?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94","html_url":"https://github.com/kezhenxu94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-07T01:47:09Z","updated_at":"2021-11-07T01:47:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> It may be more precise, but I can't customize a certain test, so I can only run all of them.\n\nThat's because you bundle the jar as an executable binary, if you treat it as a plain jar and run the specific class with that jar as a class path, it might be possible to run a single test, like `java -cp benchmark.jar org.apache.skywalking.SampleDataBenchmarkTest`.
