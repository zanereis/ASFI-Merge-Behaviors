But I was trying to avoid having to write a separate resource containing the metadata, to avoid too many round trips to HDFS. I was thinking that extended attributes (HDFS 2.5) could be a solution, but they still require a separate call to HDFS to retrieve them, and we still need to support older versions. I need to think more about this to see what a good solution would be here.\n\nRegarding FileLogger, I removed it because it only had one user, and the only functionality it really provided on top of the raw streams (the \"new file with incremented index\" method) is not needed anymore. So I didn't see the need to keep it around - it's not really providing anything useful anymore.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50552144/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50552261","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1640#issuecomment-50552261","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1640","id":50552261,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNTUyMjYx","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-29T23:11:37Z","updated_at":"2014-07-29T23:11:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA

It has to be `from pyspark.mllib import random`. And to use `RandomRDDGenerators`, I need to call `random.RandomRDDGenerators`. Ideally, it should be `from pyspark.mllib.random import RandomRDDGenerators`. If we know how to handle the name `random` now, maybe we can create `random.py` under `mllib` and define class `RandomRDDGenerators` there. If it is not easy to do that because of python's own `random` package, it should be fine to rename the package name to `rand` in both Python and Scala.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50574345/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50574526","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1562#issuecomment-50574526","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1562","id":50574526,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNTc0NTI2","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-30T05:15:59Z","updated_at":"2014-07-30T05:15:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM.

For instance, MLlib has APIs that accept RDD[LabelledPoint].  Ideally, the Java wrapper code can simply call the underlying Scala methods without having to worry about how they're implemented.  Therefore, I think we should prefer the `retag()`-based approach, since  `collectSeq` would require us to modify the Scala consumer of the RDD.\n\nSince this is a private, internal API, we should be able to revisit this decision if we change our minds later.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50576330/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50576339","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1346#issuecomment-50576339","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1346","id":50576339,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNTc2MzM5","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-30T05:53:58Z","updated_at":"2014-07-30T05:53:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA tests have started for PR 1346.
