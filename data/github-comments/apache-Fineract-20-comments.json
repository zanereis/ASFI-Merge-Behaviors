However these are the only test that fail on my machine every day if I run the integration tests in the evening - so I had a personal interest in fixing them. My suggestion would be to incorporate this PR if it looks OK to you, but we can still keep the JIRA open for other fixes of the same nature.

@vorburger I hope this is the correct approach to deal with empty catch blocks :)\r\n\r\nYour job here is going to be a little bit more challenging, thus more interesting! :smiling_imp: \r\n\r\nWhat you are getting into here is kind of related to what I alluded to in FINERACT-932... there are 2 cases: You're finding a number of obvious plain wrong **empty** `catch` statements. For example, catching a `javax.mail.MessagingException` and then just ignoring and doing absolutely nothing about it is most certainly a clear bug! If your code is trying to send out an email, and that fails, probably your SMTP server is fried, or whatever - and you certainly do want an \"operator\" who supervises error logs (e.g. like I do on https://www.fineract.dev, using https://cloud.google.com/error-reporting) do know about that. E.g. that `GeneralSecurityException` you spotted most likely also fall into this category.\r\n\r\nHowever, for e.g. `EmptyResultDataAccessException` I'm personally not entirely sure yet. What does that exception signal? Presumably Spring is indicating that some JDBC ResultSet was empty, when it should not have been? Is that OK, or a clear indication of a database corruption? That depends on the specific code... But if it is OK and can happen during \"normal\" execution, then... there is another problem - then some other Spring API which returns an empty list or an Optional or something like that should have been used instead of expecting an exception! Do you know what I mean?\r\n\r\nBTW can you write up what I'm explaining here into a follow-up PR to #912 ? :smile: ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/632006602/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/632014490","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/890#issuecomment-632014490","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/890","id":632014490,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzMjAxNDQ5MA==","user":{"login":"vorburger","id":298598,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODU5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/298598?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger","html_url":"https://github.com/vorburger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-21T10:38:42Z","updated_at":"2020-05-21T10:38:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"We should tie this together with https://github.com/apache/fineract/#releasing and from there linked https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FINERACT/How+to+Release+Apache+Fineract and (much too subtly...) https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FINERACT/Release+Sign ...\r\n\r\nI would have assumed that documentation to refer to and suggest using e.g. `./gradlew dist`, but to my surprise, have noticed that they actually do not (it currently documents a surprisingly manual process).
