thanks for the review.\n@gianm I thought more about it and realized that the \"assumption\" about the hierarchy has to be made in order to be able to do proper cleanup.

is this fixing a bug or just general hygiene?\n\nAsking because I have one concern: IIRC most of our hadoop jobs explicitly set a number of reducers (so usually mapreduce.job.reduces doesn't do anything anyway) except for the group-by job under single dimension partitioning. That job needs some way for users to specify the number of reducers, or else it will default to 1 reducer and performance will be poor. mapreduce.job.reduces seems like as good a way as any, especially since I don't think we can necessarily pick a good default for that job.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/136015154/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/136015498","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1689#issuecomment-136015498","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1689","id":136015498,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNjAxNTQ5OA==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-29T17:37:14Z","updated_at":"2015-08-29T17:37:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@drcrallen is the purpose of this so we are using the fastestInstance() everywhere we use LZ4Factory?
