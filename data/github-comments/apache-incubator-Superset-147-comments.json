As this effectively makes it impossible to make a fresh install of Superset using a Postgres backend with current stable dependencies (my hunch is that this is something brought about by psycopg2 having changed transaction defaults in the 2.7.4 version), I would suggest fixing these migrations so that they don't cause exceptions.\r\n\r\nBtw, where can the exact specs for the python 3.6 Postgres CI confs be found? Just curious to understand why CI isn't catching this, as it's running a fresh install every time.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/393620869/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/393633415","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/5111#issuecomment-393633415","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/5111","id":393633415,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MzYzMzQxNQ==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-31T18:37:49Z","updated_at":"2018-05-31T18:37:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@GabeLoins

from three different tests with identical configurations (Postgres 10.3 backend):\r\n`master`: migrating from scratch reported warnings but finished successfully\r\n`0.25.5 tag`: migration fails on first warning (see log below). \r\n`0.24.0 tag`: same as master, ie. a few warnings, but no errors.\r\n\r\nSo this is not caused by the Postgres db version. I also ran a test where I first installed 0.24.0, initialized the database, then built a new 0.25.5 container, and ran the incremental migrations against the database from the 0.24.0 version, which finished without trouble. So this seems to only affect the 0.25 branch.\r\n\r\nFull log from the 0.25.5 migration process:\r\n\r\n```\r\nINFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Context impl PostgresqlImpl.\r\nINFO
