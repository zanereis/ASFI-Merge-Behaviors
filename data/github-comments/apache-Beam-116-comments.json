guys,\r\nI'm a bit surprised to see this PR without a comment in the data format extension discussion.\r\nAs reminder, we started a discussion to provide an extension to deal with different data

time I worked on this, we actually decided to be lax about it because we don't have a short-term story for getting all runners to agree. I don't know that there's any design or consensus. Bytecode generation also changed exactly what was user code or not.\r\n\r\nMy favored style is a `PipelineExecutionException` with a cause that indicates whether the user actually threw the exception or the runner threw the exception, with a cause that is details. But that might not actually be friendly when dumped. Fn API will make this distinction quite stark so that seems the most expedient way towards a design. In a sense, the thing that has already bitten us many times is the distinction between \"user exception\" and \"SDK harness exception\" - the runner exceptions are already fairly well separated I think.\r\n\r\nFor this case, I'm not sure where the assertion failure is coming from (which is why it isn't a `RuntimeException`); I think the stack trace truncation might be hiding the details. I'd love to just follow the pattern we have already so we can save design work for later.\r\n\r\nChanging the test to some other common superclass of exceptions would definitely work, but this feels solvable by more investigation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/280731630/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/280731795","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/2007#issuecomment-280731795","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/2007","id":280731795,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MDczMTc5NQ==","user":{"login":"tgroh","id":429866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/429866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh","html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-17T18:40:49Z","updated_at":"2017-02-17T18:40:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"There's [a comment](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/core/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/testing/TestPipeline.java#L91) in `TestPipeline` that we must do so for `PAssert` failures.
