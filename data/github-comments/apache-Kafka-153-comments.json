The bulk of the changes are just the renaming we discussed in the thread. I went with a slightly different name because the directory for the code and the name in the ducktape code are semi- tied together. `DEV_BRANCH` seemed a reasonable compromise.\r\n\r\nBuried in the changes are the few test additions. I'm actually not that familiar with those tests and they include parameters that I was a bit unclear on why we have the set of parameterizations we have, so look carefully at those changes.\r\n\r\nI kicked off a test for the core system tests and it looks mostly ok here: https://jenkins.confluent.io/job/system-test-kafka-branch-builder/691/consoleFull There are some failures, but some are known (the issue with ProduceConsumeValidate).

@hachikuji Could you review? These are 2 of the last 3 built-in SMTs we have from KIP-66. I'd like to get these in since we've seen asks for both on the mailing lists (directly, for casting when the connector can't constrain the range of values, and indirectly for Flatten for use with connectors that can only handle flat schemas).\r\n\r\nThe final SMT missing is TimestampConverter, which I think is really useful, but probably too complex (both implementation + testing) to squeeze in. However, these two are useful enough that I think we should push them through if possible.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/275605386/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/275607411","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2438#issuecomment-275607411","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2438","id":275607411,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NTYwNzQxMQ==","user":{"login":"mjsax","id":8959638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NTk2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8959638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax","html_url":"https://github.com/mjsax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-27T07:47:43Z","updated_at":"2017-01-27T07:47:43Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Rebased to resolve conflict.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/275607411/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/275615867","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2429#issuecomment-275615867","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2429","id":275615867,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NTYxNTg2Nw==","user":{"login":"dguy","id":54829,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54829?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dguy","html_url":"https://github.com/dguy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dguy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dguy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dguy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dguy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dguy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dguy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dguy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dguy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dguy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-27T08:46:01Z","updated_at":"2017-01-27T08:46:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @guozhangwang.
