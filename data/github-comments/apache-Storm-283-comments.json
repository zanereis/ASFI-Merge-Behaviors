that is not an issue right now.  There are a lot of changes to the code, but most of that is creating some common helper methods and refactoring.  The only configs really impacted by this change are the daemon childopts `{nimbus,drpc,pacemaker,logviewer,ui}.childopts`  these were all really just read by storm.py by way of the ConfigValue command.  Which would then parse them using \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/bin/storm.py#L217-L234\r\n\r\nthe old code just output the value by calling .toString on it, but the new ConfigValue will first check if it is a list and stitch it back together into a String. So\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"-foo \\\"hello world\\\"\" => \"-foo \\\"hello world\\\"\" => [\"-foo\", \"hello world\"]\r\n\"-padding \\\"     \\\"\"   => \"-padding \\\"     \\\"\"  => [\"-padding\", \"     \"]\r\n```\r\nbut\r\n\r\n```\r\n[\"-foo\", \"hello world\"] => \"-foo hello world\" => [\"-foo\", \"hello\", \"world\"]\r\n[\"-padding\", \"    \"] => \"-padding     \" => [\"-padding\"]\r\n ```\r\n\r\nThis is not ideal, I agree.  Ultimately we need to add in an option to storm config to print out the config as a JSON string, or a set of JSON strings.  Then have storm.py parse it properly and add in the arguments the right way to respect white space instead of what is happening right now.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/310471444/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/310545227","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2166#issuecomment-310545227","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2166","id":310545227,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMDU0NTIyNw==","user":{"login":"liu-zhaokun","id":25218975,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4OTc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218975?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liu-zhaokun","html_url":"https://github.com/liu-zhaokun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liu-zhaokun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liu-zhaokun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liu-zhaokun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liu-zhaokun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liu-zhaokun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liu-zhaokun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liu-zhaokun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liu-zhaokun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liu-zhaokun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-23T01:24:43Z","updated_at":"2017-06-23T01:24:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@HeartSaVioR

There're some differences from bin/storm.py between two branches.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/310907171/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/310909121","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2150#issuecomment-310909121","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2150","id":310909121,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMDkwOTEyMQ==","user":{"login":"srdo","id":4324588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjQ1ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4324588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo","html_url":"https://github.com/srdo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-25T15:27:17Z","updated_at":"2017-06-25T15:27:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Created the issue for storm-kafka-monitor here https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-2600","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/310909121/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2613019987","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/6382#issuecomment-2613019987","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/6382","id":2613019987,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTMwMTk5ODc=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-26T02:47:50Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T17:15:02Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=pshah\">pshah</a>:</i>\n<p><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=Srdo\" class=\"user-hover\" rel=\"srdo\">Stig Rohde Døssing</a> Regarding first point, because the lag request is a http pull request from UI, as long as kafkaSpoutConfig.getSubscription().getTopicsString(); returns the correct value it will work since the open method would have been called eventually.

It looks to me like the getTopicsString value is put into the component configuration once, and then never updated, which is why the lag endpoint requests offsets for an empty topic list in the test I mentioned in this comment <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2150#discussion_r123901054\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2150#discussion_r123901054</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The lag endpoint uses the StormTopology ComponentCommon to read the getTopicsString value <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/64e29f365c9b5d3e15b33f33ab64e200345333e4/storm-core/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/utils/TopologySpoutLag.java#L143\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/64e29f365c9b5d3e15b33f33ab64e200345333e4/storm-core/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/utils/TopologySpoutLag.java#L143</a>. As far as I can tell, that value is set here <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/9e31509d47c4e91c1009f55c7ccf321d7d7e63aa/storm-client/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/topology/TopologyBuilder.java#L542\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/9e31509d47c4e91c1009f55c7ccf321d7d7e63aa/storm-client/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/topology/TopologyBuilder.java#L542</a>, getting fetched through getComponentConfiguration where the spout sets the topic list <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/external/storm-kafka-client/src/main/java/org/apache/storm/kafka/spout/KafkaSpout.java#L525\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/external/storm-kafka-client/src/main/java/org/apache/storm/kafka/spout/KafkaSpout.java#L525</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>The problem is that the StormTopology ComponentCommon value doesn't seem to be updated after the topology is built, so it doesn't matter what getTopicsString returns once the spout is up and running, because it'll never be propagated to the lag endpoint.</p>\n\n<p>About point 2, the worry is a minor one, but my concern isn't that the Kafka API breaks, since we use such a small part of it for storm-kafka-monitor. My concern is that the KafkaConsumer is updated to use new request versions (e.g. FetchRequest) toward Kafka. Generally older request versions are only supported for one release. In this case you wouldn't necessarily have to make any changes to your topology jar beyond replacing the client library, but you would have to rebuild storm-kafka-monitor since the jar is shaded in. Like I said, it's a fairly minor thing.</p>\n\n<p>About 3, I agree that it is possible to work around, and that there probably aren't that many Windows users. I just thought it was worth mentioning, since this is a case where there is no intrinsic reason we can't support Windows (unlike for example cgroups support), so I see it as a minor disadvantage to doing offset lag tracking this way.</p>\n\n<p>I agree that it would be good to have some opinions on whether a metrics-based solution would be desirable. My main concern about the current implementation is that I don't think point 1 works. The other two are just nitpicking to some extent.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2613019991/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/310972138","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2150#issuecomment-310972138","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2150","id":310972138,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMDk3MjEzOA==","user":{"login":"srdo","id":4324588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjQ1ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4324588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo","html_url":"https://github.com/srdo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-26T06:15:13Z","updated_at":"2017-06-26T06:15:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@priyank5485 Thanks for responding, I replied on the linked issue","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/310972138/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2613019997","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/6382#issuecomment-2613019997","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/6382","id":2613019997,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTMwMTk5OTc=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-26T06:22:28Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T17:15:03Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=pshah\">pshah</a>:</i>\n<p><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=Srdo\" class=\"user-hover\" rel=\"srdo\">Stig Rohde Døssing</a> You are right.

I don't see a way to have the defaults solely in the KafkaSpoutConfig class with no references to them from Builder, since the Builer fields have to get the default values if nothing else is set.\r\n\r\nWe could move the FirstPollOffsetStrategy default into a static field in KafkaSpoutConfig like the rest for consistency at least?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/311755011/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/311755233","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2155#issuecomment-311755233","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2155","id":311755233,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMTc1NTIzMw==","user":{"login":"srdo","id":4324588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjQ1ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4324588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo","html_url":"https://github.com/srdo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-28T18:58:32Z","updated_at":"2017-06-28T18:58:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'll squash the commits soon, I just wanted people to have a chance to review the changes without having to read the entire diff again","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/311755233/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/311756048","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2155#issuecomment-311756048","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2155","id":311756048,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMTc1NjA0OA==","user":{"login":"hmcl","id":10284328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjg0MzI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10284328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl","html_url":"https://github.com/hmcl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-28T19:01:26Z","updated_at":"2017-06-28T19:01:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yeah...
