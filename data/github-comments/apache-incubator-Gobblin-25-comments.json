I can merge this PR, but I have one last request.\n\nCan you add some documentation to the Gobblin Docs about this feature, you can probably just copy what you have in your Google Doc. If you have time its always nice to add documentation on configuration keys and documentation on the different plugin points. This is generally useful for any new Gobblin user who wants to write to a RDMS (I already know of one user waiting on this PR because they want to use this).\n\nAll Gobblin documentation is checked into GitHub under `gobblin-docs`. I suggest putting the documentation in a new file called `gobblin-docs/user-guide/Gobblin-JDBC-Writer.md`. The format of the files is all in Markdown. It's should be a relatively simple process, but if you have more questions this page has more details:
