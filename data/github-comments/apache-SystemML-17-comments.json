Added python test cases for matrix (as per @asurve suggestion).\r\n2. Added web documentation for all the Python APIs: http://niketanpansare.github.io/incubator-systemml/python-reference  (as per @asurve suggestion).\r\n3. Much tighter integration with NumPy (and several additional operators supported) via https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/reference/ufuncs.html\r\n4. Facility to enable and disable lazy evaluation via `set_lazy` method  (as per @dusenberrymw  suggestion).\r\n5. matrix class itself has almost all basic linear algebra operators supported by DML. \r\n6. Update SystemML.jar to *-incubating.jar (as per @lresende suggestion).\r\n7. Added maven cleanup logic  (as per @deroneriksson  suggestion).\r\n8.  Integrate python testcases with maven and jenkins: @dusenberrymw  @akchinSTC, @asurve To run test on Jenkins:\r\n  * Set the RUN_PYTHON_TEST flag in the org.apache.sysml.test.integration.functions.python.PythonTestRunner class  to true. This is currently set to false until we ensure below two steps.\r\n  * We will have to setup Spark and SPARK_HOME environment.\r\n  * Make sure SystemML.jar is created in the target/ folder before tests are run (This should happen automatically). \r\n\r\nRemaining tasks:\r\n1. Large-scale testing: The current matrix has a huge performance issue (due to py4j conversion) especially in non-lazy setting or when evaluated too often. This issue was partly in this PR by reducing the explicit conversion during eval.\r\n2. Pushdown-able loop structures.\r\n3. Explore integration of non-unfuncs in Numpy (such as concatenate)\r\n4.

Almost all deep learning frameworks (including Tensorflow, Caffe, Torch and Theano) store their tensors in the dense format and don't support multilevel caching. So, disabling sparse operations may not be such a bad idea if the user wants to run a deep learning algorithm. Due to the characteristics of mini-batch gradient descent, disabling caching might be a good idea when the user is providing large enough memory budget (which is evident from the below experiment).\r\n\r\nI ran some preliminary performance experiments comparing conv2d with and without sparse/caching. I provided fairly large memory budget (-Xmx20g -Xms20g -Xmn2048m -server) and used Open JDK 1.8 64-Bit Server VM.

The DML script used for this comparison is as follows:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nX = matrix(0.1, rows=$1, cols=$2)\r\nY = matrix(0.2, rows=$2, cols=$3)\r\nZ = matrix(0, rows=$1, cols=$3)\r\nfor(i in 1:1000) {\r\n        Z = Z + X %*% Y\r\n}\r\nprint(as.scalar(Z[1,1]))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe values provided to $1, $2 and $3 are `1 10 100 1000 2000 5000 10000`, allowing us to test the performance of matrix multiplication for different shapes. I then extracted the time required for \"ba+\\*\" from the heavy hitters from each case and plotted them. The common dimension (i.e. $2) is plotted along the X-axis and the speedup `time_for_ba+*_cp / time_for_ba+*_native` is plotted along the Y-axis. The number of rows of X (i.e. $1) and the number of columns of Y (i.e. $3) are plotted using facets. \r\n\r\n**For example:** The datapoint in red square refers to the speedup of native ba+\\* over LibMatrixMult for the case `(1000, 5000) %*% (5000, 100)`.
