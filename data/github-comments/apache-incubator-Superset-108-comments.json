also welcome such a functionality.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the meantime, you can emulate it by simply projecting the dates of previous periods into the current one.\r\n\r\n**This is an example for comparing different years (in PostgreSQL syntax):**\r\n\r\nLet's assume that `timecol` is your temporal column.\r\nThen just create a calculated temporal column `timecol_projected` within superset's table definition that projects the dates of previous years into the current one:\r\n```\r\ntimecol + (date_trunc('year',current_date) - date_trunc('year', timecol ))\r\n```\r\nFurthermore, you create a calculated column `year` which is groupable/filterable, e.g.:\r\n```\r\nto_char(auftrag_ende::date, 'IYYY')\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow you can create a Time Series Line Chart, using `timecol_projected` as Time Column and `year` as Group By and maybe Filter column. \r\nThe start date can then be chosen to any value before the beginning of the current year and can stay like this forever. No need to adjust anything when the year changes.\r\n\r\nIn your case, you should be able to adapt this approach fairly easily by projecting everything to the current day and selecting the data of this month, the last month via a calculated `month` column.\r\nInclude the last year's day trend, though, might be a bit more challenging, but I'm confident that with a bit more magic with calculated columns for `year` and/or `year_month` plus some custom WHERE condition, or with an entirely customized SQL query, it can be done in the fashion described above.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/344173537/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/344177771","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/3840#issuecomment-344177771","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/3840","id":344177771,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NDE3Nzc3MQ==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-14T08:11:43Z","updated_at":"2017-11-14T08:11:43Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hoping

fathom the scale @Mogball of your Druid datasources, but for us this request takes mere seconds and thus I'm unsure whether the 4x speedup (maximum) of a multi-threaded environment outweighs the additional complexity, potential thread-safeness etc.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/345404884/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/345406215","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/3895#issuecomment-345406215","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/3895","id":345406215,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NTQwNjIxNQ==","user":{"login":"Mogball","id":15016832,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDE2ODMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15016832?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mogball","html_url":"https://github.com/Mogball","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mogball/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mogball/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mogball/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mogball/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mogball/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mogball/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mogball/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mogball/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mogball/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-18T01:13:45Z","updated_at":"2017-11-18T01:13:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The speed up is more than just 4x (or whatever the number of available threads). Most of the time is spent waiting for Druid to respond, which means that the metadata requests are issued more or less simultaneously for each datasource, and then processed when they all start coming back. This makes a difference of like 40 seconds to 3 seconds (when hard refreshing all datasources).\r\n\r\nThis should be thread-safe since there is no interaction outside of the datasource object and with the Superset backend during refresh.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/345406215/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/345416549","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/3656#issuecomment-345416549","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/3656","id":345416549,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NTQxNjU0OQ==","user":{"login":"liuzn4ever","id":30370101,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMzcwMTAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30370101?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzn4ever","html_url":"https://github.com/liuzn4ever","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzn4ever/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzn4ever/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzn4ever/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzn4ever/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzn4ever/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzn4ever/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzn4ever/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzn4ever/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzn4ever/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-18T04:03:51Z","updated_at":"2017-11-18T04:03:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"A page is intercepted by the browser ,you can use the Edge of win10，then you can download the dashboard file,and its suffix name is .pickle","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/345416549/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
