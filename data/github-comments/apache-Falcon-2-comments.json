This is very useful and thanks for doing it. While I am migrating the existing code to lifecycle, I understand that we have to cater to user requests for new features also along with migration. However, this keeps adding more work on migration as well. I think it will help in the transition if we decide on a no more feature addition to existing import / export along with a timeline for completing the transition so that the new features additions don't have to wait too long either.
