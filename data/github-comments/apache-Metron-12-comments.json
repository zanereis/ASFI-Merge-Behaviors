This was a long-standing issue, but when the classpath shuffled around, it bit us all.\n- Apache Curator 2.10.0 is now a dependency of the storm-kafka component.  The service discovery piece of this version seems to have a bug that prevents it from working with Model as a Service.  We are maintaining the dependency on 2.7.1 for the time being, but should look further into it in a follow-on JIRA.\n\nOne thing to note, is that when this PR is merged, we will need to regenerate the

`quick-dev`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/255401683/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/255404552","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/312#issuecomment-255404552","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/312","id":255404552,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NTQwNDU1Mg==","user":{"login":"cestella","id":540359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella","html_url":"https://github.com/cestella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-21T15:14:34Z","updated_at":"2016-10-21T15:14:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"+1\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/255404552/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/255404882","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/311#issuecomment-255404882","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/311","id":255404882,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NTQwNDg4Mg==","user":{"login":"cestella","id":540359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella","html_url":"https://github.com/cestella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-21T15:15:49Z","updated_at":"2016-10-21T15:15:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"+1

HDP 2.5 pulls in some commits from a later version of Storm. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39932441/storm-ui-throwing-offset-lags-for-kafka-not-supported-for-older-versions-pleas\n\nThis doesn't appear to affect the topologies working, but it does make it appear like there's a problem through the UI. Should we hold off on this PR until this is resolved? One suggestion is to leverage profiles to enable building against different repos. There would still need to be an Apache version that is built and deployed with EC2, full-dev, and quick-dev. And all of those environments are based on HDP bits, meaning the lag error will show up there regardless of what we do with profiles.

Note that this was on a fresh deployment and _not_ one with HDP already present.\n\nAt the outset, the co-location error messages are seen against the Metron nodes. After a few moments, there is an exclamation against a faulty host with the error message seen on mouse-over.\n\n1) Against the MySQL server, the error text says \"Metron Enrichment Master must be co-located...\". I understand that the primary usage of this node is for the enrichment, yes. But wanted to know if this text is intentional. Or should we rename the error to indicate the MySQL node?\n\n![mysql-server-error-colocation](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20395490/19727509/5cdb07da-9bad-11e6-9cf9-3e6cdfb99f2b.png)\n\n2) At the very first time, Metron Parsers node displays the error about KAFKA_BROKER co-location. Subsequently, once the KAFKA node is added, this error changes to STORM SUPERVISOR co-location. This is seen to work as expected. \n\n![kafka-colocation](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20395490/19727792/7cbf4542-9bae-11e6-9f39-aef21645bb3f.png)\n\n![storm-colocation](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20395490/19727797/8490807e-9bae-11e6-913b-3a7b33366e38.png)\n\n3) I hit a weird issue where the whole install screen froze when I tried the following:\na. With the defaults, i.e. Metron Parsers showing error about KAFKA colocation\nb. Added a KAFKA host to the same as Metron Parsers -> Now, the error shows STORM SUPERVISOR colocation\nc. Removed the KAFKA host that was added in Step 'a' above.\nd.

I had to go back to Ambari and use the Host->Actions screen to add a storm supervisor to the node. Likewise, I had to also use the Host->MetronHost->Add Clients option to install HBASE client, which is required during service startup, since the MetronHost did not have the clients installed during the initial HDP deployment.\n- Clicked through the wizard and was able to bring up the cluster fine without issues\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/256687881/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/256691291","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/315#issuecomment-256691291","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/315","id":256691291,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NjY5MTI5MQ==","user":{"login":"dlyle65535","id":3439113,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MzkxMTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3439113?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535","html_url":"https://github.com/dlyle65535","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-27T16:08:25Z","updated_at":"2016-10-27T16:08:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"reopening for travis error. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/256691291/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/256697401","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/329#issuecomment-256697401","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/329","id":256697401,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NjY5NzQwMQ==","user":{"login":"dlyle65535","id":3439113,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MzkxMTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3439113?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535","html_url":"https://github.com/dlyle65535","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-27T16:29:30Z","updated_at":"2016-10-27T16:29:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks good to me, Otto.
