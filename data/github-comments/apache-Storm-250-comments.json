This is not that easy as just checking the interface type.\n1. Entire logic is strongly tied to IMetricsConsumer and IMetricConsumer.DataPoint. Given that we would want to introduce IAggregatedMetricsConsumer and IAggregatedMetricsConsumer.DataPoint (or AggregatedDataPoint), we need to fix all of the usages including Filter and MetricsConsumerBolt and so on. We can't fix IMetricsConsumer and its DataPoint as non-backward compatible way.\n2. Aggregating metrics should be handled from SystemBolt, not MetricsConsumerBolt which we initialize the metrics consumer. We're allowing users to set multiple metrics consumers for the topology, which means that user can set both IMetricsConsumer and IAggregatedMetricsConsumer. Do we want to push the metrics to both unaggregated and aggregated things via separate stream?\n\nPlease share the idea with details if anyone has better and clean one.

Meaning it would connect to zookeeper, blobstore, local caches, etc. just as if it were the nimbus daemon. We have run into situations in the past where nimbus is down because of bad state stored somewhere.  Having a tool that can do everything nimbus does is important.  Having a separate daemon to do this feels too complicated, and also exposes a lot more potential for attack.  At the beginning I would say just have a command line tool that will create a <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/storm-core/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/cluster/IStormClusterState.java\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">ClusterState</a> a <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/storm-core/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/blobstore/BlobStore.java\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">BlobStore</a> and possibly a <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/storm-core/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/utils/LocalState.java\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">LocalState</a> like nimbus currently does.  Once those are created for this project we would just then run through some code very similar to <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1572/files\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">cleanup-corrupt-topologies!</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In the future we could have it do many more things.  Having a UI in the future would probably need a separate daemon for security reasons, but we use this type of operation so rarely that I don't see much value in setting up an RPC daemon for it.  If we want a UI have the UI be baked into the admin command so it would be a web process that is running with the same privlages as nimbus, and there is no need for RPC at all, just run it locally.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612929348/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/241428654","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1636#issuecomment-241428654","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1636","id":241428654,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MTQyODY1NA==","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-22T14:22:59Z","updated_at":"2016-08-22T14:22:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/241428654/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/241429273","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1637#issuecomment-241429273","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1637","id":241429273,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MTQyOTI3Mw==","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-22T14:24:54Z","updated_at":"2016-08-22T14:24:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1

During the time worker heartbeats are not restored completely, Nimbus will think these workers are dead because of heartbeats timeout, then to reassign these \"dead\" workers continuously until heartbeats restore to normal. So, during recovery time, many topologies will be reassigned then the throughput will goes very down. \nThis is not acceptable. \nSo i think, pacemaker is not suitable for production if the problem above exists.\ni think several ways to solve this problem:\n1. pacemaker HA\n2. when pacemaker does down, notice nimbus not to reassign any more until it recover\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/242294656/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612696621","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/5279#issuecomment-2612696621","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/5279","id":2612696621,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI2OTY2MjE=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-25T08:39:25Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T14:42:48Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=kabhwan\">kabhwan</a>:</i>\n<p>Since we construct TridentTopology to submit to Nimbus, for now we can print the internal graph of TridentTopology to show physical plan for that.<br/>\n(Currently printing graph is really verbose and not showing which operation is in node.
