It should be `/mnt/nifi-1.2.0-SNAPSHOT` but it was just `/mnt`.\r\n\r\nI also found that without `run.as` property, nifi.sh doesn't work with this PR. It seems Command argument is not passed properly to RunNiFi:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n[root@ip-172-31-20-144 nifi-1.2.0-SNAPSHOT-root]# ./bin/nifi.sh status\r\nJava home: /usr/lib/jvm/jre\r\nNiFi home: /mnt/nifi-1.2.0-SNAPSHOT-root\r\nBootstrap Config File: /mnt/nifi-1.2.0-SNAPSHOT-root/conf/bootstrap.conf\r\nUsage:\r\njava org.apache.nifi.bootstrap.RunNiFi [<-verbose>] <command> [options]\r\nValid commands include: ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nI will keep investigating what's going on but would like to share current status. Please let me know if you noticed something.\r\n\r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/279901484/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/279905194","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1405#issuecomment-279905194","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1405","id":279905194,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3OTkwNTE5NA==","user":{"login":"apiri","id":502889,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjg4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/502889?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri","html_url":"https://github.com/apiri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-15T03:09:59Z","updated_at":"2017-02-15T03:09:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Was this performed by the PR on its own or applied on top of current master?
