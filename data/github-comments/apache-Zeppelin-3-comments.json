If there're kill them. eg) ps -ef | grep -i zeppelin | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill\n3.  start zeppelin and try run some code\n4.  if connection refused error raised, then check logs/zeppelin-interpreter-[INTERPRETER_NAME]-*.log if there're any exception.\n\n## \n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-zeppelin/pull/40#issuecomment-98254553.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/98458137/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/98535254","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/40#issuecomment-98535254","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/40","id":98535254,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk4NTM1MjU0","user":{"login":"charles-cai","id":127682,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzY4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/127682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/charles-cai","html_url":"https://github.com/charles-cai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charles-cai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charles-cai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charles-cai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charles-cai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charles-cai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charles-cai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charles-cai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charles-cai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charles-cai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-03T20:10:45Z","updated_at":"2015-05-03T20:11:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"really stupid question: I have the same problem and I have 2 processes running, how to check if my interpreters are running?

I'm currently (Zeppelin master, HDP 2.2w/ spark tech preview on yarn) getting \"bad substitution\" errors from launch_container.sh:27, an issue similar to Ambari-8028 (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMBARI-8028) and which I suspect is down to remaining references to ${hdp.version} (and potentially $PWD, $HADOOP_CONF_DIR), which I'm chasing down now.\n\nI think it might be a good idea to move the classpath over to zeppelin-site.xml in any case, since over the long term managing the classpath via shell scripts is going to be painful and not user-friendly. Especially the CLASSPATH+= makes identifying the issue I encountered very difficult.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/101553576/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/101554581","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/73#issuecomment-101554581","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/73","id":101554581,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwMTU1NDU4MQ==","user":{"login":"khalidhuseynov","id":1642088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDIwODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1642088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov","html_url":"https://github.com/khalidhuseynov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-13T07:47:08Z","updated_at":"2015-05-13T07:47:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Triggering

There is a comment which declares this as a work-around to make Zeppelin build with Hadoop/YARN 2.2.\n\nAs a quick work-around you can set the protobuf-java version to 2.5.0 in the zeppelin-flink `pom.xml`.
