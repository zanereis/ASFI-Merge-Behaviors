quirks)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/202512087/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/202512566","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/1062#issuecomment-202512566","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1062","id":202512566,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwMjUxMjU2Ng==","user":{"login":"eirslett","id":1872593,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NzI1OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1872593?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett","html_url":"https://github.com/eirslett","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-28T18:08:40Z","updated_at":"2016-03-28T18:08:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/202512566/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/202559147","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/1062#issuecomment-202559147","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1062","id":202559147,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwMjU1OTE0Nw==","user":{"login":"abesto","id":59982,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5OTgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59982?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abesto","html_url":"https://github.com/abesto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abesto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abesto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abesto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abesto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abesto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abesto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abesto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abesto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abesto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-28T19:58:10Z","updated_at":"2016-03-28T19:58:10Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Nice!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/202559147/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/202595403","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1066#issuecomment-202595403","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1066","id":202595403,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwMjU5NTQwMw==","user":{"login":"fluidjeel","id":10943776,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTQzNzc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10943776?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fluidjeel","html_url":"https://github.com/fluidjeel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fluidjeel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fluidjeel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fluidjeel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fluidjeel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fluidjeel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fluidjeel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fluidjeel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fluidjeel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fluidjeel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-28T21:53:49Z","updated_at":"2016-03-28T21:54:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[root@ixxxx

Finagle includes a `finagle-zipkin` library that implements a Zipkin tracer. Unfortunately, that tracer is only configured to work with scribe. I'm also not a big fan of scribe, and at present we bypass scribe altogether by configuring Finagle's ZipkinTracer to send data directly to a zipkin-collector process on port 9410.  All of that said, we still require scribe protocol support for this setup to work.\n\nThere's an open issue with the Finagle folks tracking implementation of an http-based tracer instead: https://github.com/twitter/finagle/issues/465.  That seems promising, and given the widespread use of Zipkin+Finagle, I think that upgrading Finagle is a logical precursor to removing scribe support. It's true that folks could patch their finagle-zipkin tracers to speak http, but that feels like more of a workaround than an actual fix.\n\nSwapping out Finagle's scribe implementation with an http one brings up a larger issue that I think is worth pointing out.  How do we know that an http-backed Zipkin tracer is as performant as Finagle's scribe-backed Zipkin tracer?  The existing scribe tracer is widely deployed within Twitter's own infrastructure. It has been tuned and tested in thousands of super-high-traffic applications over many years. Do we have any side-by-side comparisons of the proposed http tracer versus the existing tracer?\n\nI have a similar concern with the zipkin-java project, although I have to admit that I'm not nearly as familiar with that project, so my concerns may be unfounded. The scala-based `zipkin-collector` and `zipkin-query` processes have been heavily tuned to withstand a high volume of requests. They operate independently, such that a degradation in one process does not affect the ability of the other to serve requests.  Do we have the same guarantees with an all-in-one zipkin-java process?  \"Lower complexity\" may not actually be an improvement in this case if it has a negative impact on resiliency.\n\nThanks for opening this issue as a place to track discussion.

The technical complexity is about the same (I think), but more people know Java than Scala.\n\n> No built-in Scribe collector support, breaking feature parity\n\nI think we should add scribe support to zipkin-java. The java port should be a drop-in replacement for the scala implementation, so we don't need to make any changes to the instrumented applications.\n\n> Multi-process Zipkin provides extra resiliency\n\n,\n\n> They [collector/query] operate independently, such that a degradation in one process does not affect the ability of the other to serve requests.\n\nThis could be solved in the infrastructure, by only sending query traffic to some instances, and only sending collector traffic to other instances. I'm not concerned about query workloads taking down a collector (it's very low volume), but a collector which is receiving too many spans could possibly crash, and then the query functionality wouldn't work either. So for extra resiliency, you could deploy one query-only instance that is guaranteed to answer, even when the collectors are flooded. (Unless the storage backend is also kneeling)\n\n> How do we know that an http-backed Zipkin tracer is as performant as Finagle's scribe-backed Zipkin tracer?\n\nWe should write a couple of load tests:\n\n```\nfinagle -> scribe -> zipkin-scala\nfinagle -> http -> zipkin-scala (if this is supported?)\nfinagle -> scribe -> zipkin-java\nfinagle -> http -> zipkin-java\n```\n\nand see how many spans per second we can process.\nAlso, measure how latency in the storage backend affects server performance, and how much traffic the collector can take before it crashes.\n\n> moving the fundamental infra away from [~~scribe and~~] scala isn't inherently problematic as much as it is labor intensive.\n\nGiven that Zipkin is distributed as a shaded jar, Scala is already an implementation detail from the infrastructure point of view; it's just a jvm process, or even just a Docker container. But given that Twitter builds Zipkin from source, for Manhattan support (is that still true?) then there would be a rewrite effort, since the APIs would be Java, not Scala.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/203133795/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/203158334","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1074#issuecomment-203158334","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1074","id":203158334,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwMzE1ODMzNA==","user":{"login":"gena01","id":312125,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjEyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/312125?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gena01","html_url":"https://github.com/gena01","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gena01/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gena01/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gena01/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gena01/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gena01/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gena01/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gena01/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gena01/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gena01/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-29T23:33:09Z","updated_at":"2016-03-29T23:33:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I

are valid concerns, though I'd like to mention a few things that all\nmight not know. They impact the perception of supportability:\n- zipkin's scala code has had numerous significant bugs, yet very few have\n  contributed fixes to it.\n- very little of the scala code is actually used inside Twitter. For\n  example, twitter doesn't use cassandra.\n- there is little evidence of heavy tuning in the source history of the\n  scala code\n- benchmarks in scala that have happened have been ad-hoc. For example,\n  pyramid-zipkin adjusting parameters for kafka (these parameters exist in\n  both java and scala projects)\n\nThe scala+finagle aspect has actually led directly to people not\nparticipating in the project, and also delayed features for extreme amounts\nof time. For example, elasticsearch was requested years ago, and had some\nfalse-starts. Elasticsearch was implemented in java in less than a week by\nsomeone who formerly had no experience with zipkin. There's a lot of\nevidence we can dig up about this, and this was a primary motivation for\nthe java project itself.\n\nWhile both the scala and java processes can enable a feature like kafka,\nthere's no reason to believe that either choice means a resilience fail.\nBefore, we had no choice for an all-in-one process: that significantly\ndamaged the ability for people to learn zipkin quickly. IOTW, let's not\nmistake choice for a topology mandate. It is already the case that folks\nhave collectors in golang and whatnot. There's nothing preventing someone\nfrom making a zipkin server that is only a collector. in fact, there\nalready is one in spring-cloud-sleuth for rabbit.\n\nzipkin-java had a scribe transport, but it was deleted because scribe is\narchived and folks involved in zipkin had bad experience with scribe. We can\nchoose to re-enable that feature in java using facebook swift (history\nlesson: facebook made scribe and thrift, so this choice shouldn't be scary)\n\nRegardless of whether folks want a scala+finagle thing or not, it is\nimportant that zipkin lives. Right now, I spend a great deal of time on\nundifferentiated work in scala eventhough I get lots of help in java.

This could be measured to see if batching helps reduce load or not.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/204244166/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/204354590","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1071#issuecomment-204354590","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1071","id":204354590,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNDM1NDU5MA==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-01T11:25:16Z","updated_at":"2016-04-01T11:25:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I've resurrected scribe in the java project. once https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-java/pull/152 is released, I'll scrub it from the pro/con list in the description\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/204354590/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/204625872","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1081#issuecomment-204625872","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1081","id":204625872,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNDYyNTg3Mg==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-02T01:52:35Z","updated_at":"2016-04-02T01:52:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"ex. we literally have a test to try later on NullPointerException!

(Thare are many ready-to-use implementations in the Brave project)\n6) Configure Brave so that it sends traces to Zipkin - either to Kafka (if you use that) or directly with HTTP.\n7) Start your application, use it a little bit so it generates traffic, watch trace data end up in the Zipkin UI.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/205480749/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/205507333","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1085#issuecomment-205507333","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1085","id":205507333,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNTUwNzMzMw==","user":{"login":"eirslett","id":1872593,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NzI1OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1872593?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett","html_url":"https://github.com/eirslett","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-04T21:35:37Z","updated_at":"2016-04-04T21:35:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I suspect that id: 00001 and parentId 00000 could be the problem?\nUsually, the top level span has trace id = parent id = span id.\nIn that case, it's your application instrumentation that has a bug.\nThat being said, I think the UI should be able to handle cases like this anyways.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/205507333/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/205511483","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1085#issuecomment-205511483","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1085","id":205511483,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNTUxMTQ4Mw==","user":{"login":"prat0318","id":1528697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Mjg2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1528697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prat0318","html_url":"https://github.com/prat0318","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prat0318/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prat0318/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prat0318/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prat0318/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prat0318/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prat0318/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prat0318/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prat0318/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prat0318/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-04T21:47:16Z","updated_at":"2016-04-04T21:47:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"It shows up fine with the older UI.\n\nAlso, as per [the docs](http://zipkin.io/pages/instrumenting.html), `span_id` can be the same `trace_id` but is not mentioned it must or should.
