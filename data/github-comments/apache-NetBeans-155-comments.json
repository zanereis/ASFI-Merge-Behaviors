This is\r\nbecause students are both beginners, and quite usually of very modest means.\r\nStudents also take other courses, where the tools and programs they need are\r\nWindows-based so there is no way for me to ask students to acquire another\r\nmachine, and learn to use some Unix-derived system (that takes more\r\nunderstanding than they have when starting in the computing world).\r\n\r\nSo, by saying, “not using Windows,” is virtually equivalent to saying, “don’t\r\nuse NetBeans.” Do not get me wrong. I have used many IDE’s, and in fact at\r\none time was an evangelist for NetBeans when employed by Sun\r\nMicrosystems. It is probably the easiest to learn of all the “industrial grade”\r\nIDEs. (But even working for Sun, the “enemy” of Microsoft, demonstrations\r\nof NetBeans were most often made on Windows machines, at the request\r\nof potential customers—who may have been only later converted to Solaris.)\r\n\r\nSo, the copy-and-paste problems cannot be regarded as a non-issue by\r\ndismissing the world’s use of Windows! I regard such a suggestion as being\r\nunresponsive. You may have intended the response to be humor, but it\r\nis a serious problem for serious users (and probably future proponents\r\nof the use) of NetBeans.\r\n\r\nRegards, Bruce K. Haddon\r\n\r\np.s. Why is Windows the problem? I have many other applications that work\r\nquite well using copy-and-paste on Windows, and I also have Java applications\r\nof my own that use the JDK copy-and-paste software, and they also work exactly\r\nas expected. Is NetBeans trying to do something clever (like caching) with\r\ncopy-and-paste? It really is a mystery (and it is a more recent phenomenon).\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\nDr. Bruce K.

I think the problems are:\r\n\r\n- that the Github's merge button has three very different functions in one single button (that's indeed a  bad UI design) and it's easy to choose the wrong one if you're distracted. Accidents happen!\r\n- github did some weird stuff with author names and may be a problem to track code provenance (I can't tell if it still does or not).\r\n\r\nReading the 2020 thread in the mailing list I see that @neilcsmith-net wanted to keep the squash option in github. It eased things during releases, IIRC.\r\n\r\nOne solution that may fit all is to keep the button as is, and let each committer to decide whether contributions are to be squashed using this github three-in-one button or to request a squash for contributtions. I personally will choose the second one from one on.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1462670939/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1462753591","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/5591#issuecomment-1462753591","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5591","id":1462753591,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5XL9k3","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-09T20:37:03Z","updated_at":"2023-03-09T20:37:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"If I understand if correctly, the API of `core.windows` is provided by `org.openide.windows`.

I guess I am sensitive to the Windows/Non-Windows issue.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, I worked for Sun in various roles, mostly customer-facing, and consequently as a matter of course had to use Windows, although I did have Solaris as an alternative boot on my laptop (rarely used). This was at a time when the official Sun (McNealy) policy was that having Windows on a Sun-provided machine was (theoretically) a firing offense. Prior to working for Sun, I had used Windows, VAX VMS, Solaris, Unix 7, IBM OS, plus at least 4 OS’s that I had written or supported myself (as well as several other lesser-known operating systems), so apart from the convenience these days of using Windows and the needs of my students, I am reasonably agnostic to the debates, other than getting annoyed when getting mixed into such debating situations.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I shall try the command line suggestion.\r\n\r\nThanks for the support,\r\n\r\nBruce\r\n\r\nFrom: Laszlo Kishalmi ***@***.***>\r\nSent: Thursday, 9 March, 2023 17:59\r\nTo: apache/netbeans ***@***.***>\r\nCc: Bruce Haddon ***@***.***>; Mention ***@***.***>\r\nSubject: Re: [apache/netbeans] NetBeans IDE processes do not terminate, and cannot be cancelled.

I have a serious problem with one of the `php.editor` unittests.\r\n\r\nFor a quick glance, you can have a look here: https://github.com/apache/netbeans/actions/runs/4386975881\r\n\r\nThere are two problems I don't understand:\r\n\r\n1. The reformatted contents differs between the two platforms (compare actual reformatted result for Linux and Windows)\r\n2. Both unittest results do not match the result I get when running the build interactively:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2179736/224420619-cf580054-3b09-4264-a4e7-c095a263d3ef.png)\r\n\r\nThe problem in the unittest can be reproduced locally by running:\r\n\r\n```\r\nant -f php/php.editor -Dtest.type=unit -Dtest.class=org.netbeans.modules.php.editor.js.JsFormatterEmbeddedTest -Dtest.methods=testEmbeddedMultipleSections1  test-method\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning the test multiple times gives me sometimes the windows and sometimes the linux result. Something is fishy here, especially that this looks like a heisenbug.\r\n\r\nChanges in the indention are kind of expected. The formatting in the test relied on the CSS indenter having run. This was the case because the `id=\"source\"` attribute in the `script` attribute was recognized as CSS. This behavior was modified, the id attribute is parsed and handled as a normal html attribute. You can observe differing idention when you test master and replace `id=` with `ic=`. The latter will not trigger the special casing.\r\n\r\nAny ideas are welcome.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1464463836/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1464641645","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/3962#issuecomment-1464641645","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/3962","id":1464641645,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5XTKht","user":{"login":"spyhunter99","id":1975321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzUzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1975321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spyhunter99","html_url":"https://github.com/spyhunter99","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spyhunter99/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spyhunter99/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spyhunter99/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spyhunter99/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spyhunter99/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spyhunter99/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spyhunter99/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spyhunter99/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spyhunter99/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-10T23:33:28Z","updated_at":"2023-03-10T23:33:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"ha i've seen this problem since i started using netbeans v5.

It is purely a bytecode level backport and is optional if NB is run on the _right_ JDK (same version as the one nb-javac was based on). Community installers for example could easily bundle NB without nb-javac in it, even NB itself could [download a runtime JDK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uEIqAd2JBk) and completely drop the nb-javac dependency some time in future.\r\n\r\nI don't see what problem this PR is solving beside adding complexity and an indirection to the build process. Soon we will switch to building/testing on JDK 21 EA and part of the test is using the EA compiler too. The javac of the JDK works just fine and we make sure it builds on all LTS versions. Again: nb-javac is just a dependency for some modules, we don't have to bootstrap the whole project with it. NetBeans is more than just the java editor which currently relies on nb-javac.\r\n\r\nnb-javac is currently also not in this repository (or even an apache project unless I miss something obvious), so I am not sure what you mean by \"eat your own dog food\".\r\n\r\nI would not want to see this added to the project since I frankly don't see a reason for it.

That way \"nb-javac\" would just \"be\" `jdk.compiler`. No fiddling with the build environment necessary.\r\n\r\nThe drawback is: the`nb-javac` is not used that way in NetBeans. NetBeans is using similar \"classloader trick\" with [masking JDK classes](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/blob/c8de82fc93cc1dee8b385e77f1aa7352d6eecec8/java/libs.nbjavacapi/manifest.mf#L6).

I wanted to \"Eat our own dog food\" with `nb-javac@19`, but I couldn't as https://github.com/JaroslavTulach/nb-javac/pull/11 - we wouldn't found that problem with `--upgrade-module-path` option. \r\n\r\nWhile [real JDK test](https://github.com/JaroslavTulach/nb-javac/blob/1c6acf4c26172973075d4027ca39a36c063ad43b/build-jdk.sh#L99) is also useful check, for NetBeans I'd rather stick with old good \"classloader trick\".","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1465276210/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1465279276","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/5333#issuecomment-1465279276","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5333","id":1465279276,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5XVmMs","user":{"login":"eirikbakke","id":886243,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NjI0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/886243?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke","html_url":"https://github.com/eirikbakke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-12T19:25:18Z","updated_at":"2023-03-12T19:25:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you!

Unless something significant changes in ASF rules, nb-javac is never going to be our \"own dog food\".

We don't have unlimited capacity.\r\n\r\n\\* one option to investigate, and discussed previously, might be running the backport javac build inside the NetBeans build, assuming no GPL+CPE sources required on our side.
