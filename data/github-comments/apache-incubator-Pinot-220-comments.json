Default value is 3 minutes)\r\n \r\nBut, you mentioned that increasing `stream.kafka.fetch.timeout.millis` helped to unblock. If this is the case, Kafka client's `client.poll()` call actually timed out over and over again. In this case, this case needs to be handled from the Kafka client but it's a little bit of an edge case since the client was behaving as expected based on the provided timeout. \r\n\r\nOne graceful handling would be:\r\n\r\n- Kafka client should return empty records for a message batch and bump up the offset before timeout when all the records are filtered out (e.g. aborted transactions).\r\n\r\nThe workaround would be the following:\r\n\r\n- Bump up the `stream.kafka.fetch.timeout.millis` to fully skip the offsets.\r\n- Or, pause & resume with latest to skip records, backfill the missing data.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1911490044/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1911510260","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/12323#issuecomment-1911510260","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/12323","id":1911510260,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5x71T0","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-26T05:31:48Z","updated_at":"2024-01-27T16:58:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## [Codecov](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/12323?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=apache) Report\nAttention: `2 lines` in your changes are missing coverage.

There are ways to enable retries on them but during that period the ZK config has downloadURL has empty. \r\n\r\nNow if the minion tasks runs during this period, the downloadURL is fetched as null and passed on to task-execution phase where it throws NPE.

The \"high availability\" term I am using was refer to [hadoop HA definition](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HDFSHighAvailabilityWithNFS.html), which means running with 2 or more nodes for the same instance as active/standby(s). The issue is not exactly same as here and I am open to the naming.\r\n\r\nTheoretically, running with expected - 1 is what we always observe during real world node replacement. Probably track \"actual <= expected - 1\" as SEGMENTS_WITH_LESS_REPLICAS?\r\nAnd running with only 1 replica has far more risks than other <expected values (e.g. 2, 3 ...). Not sure if it is a overkill to track it separately.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1920166282/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1920640184","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/12297#issuecomment-1920640184","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/12297","id":1920640184,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5yeqS4","user":{"login":"jackjlli","id":35080149,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MDgwMTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35080149?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli","html_url":"https://github.com/jackjlli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-01T07:04:51Z","updated_at":"2024-02-01T07:04:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Comments have been addressed in the latest push and the description is updated.

Yes, having a well defined definition is important. The \"high availability\" term I am using was refer to [hadoop HA definition](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HDFSHighAvailabilityWithNFS.html), which means running with 2 or more nodes for the same instance as active/standby(s). The issue is not exactly same as here and I am open to the naming.\r\n> \r\n> Theoretically, running with expected - 1 is what we always observe during real world node replacement. Probably track \"actual <= expected - 1\" as SEGMENTS_WITH_LESS_REPLICAS? And running with only 1 replica has far more risks than other <expected values (e.g. 2, 3 ...). Not sure if it is a overkill to track it separately.\r\n\r\nI think SEGMENTS_WITH_REDUCED_CAPACITY OR LESS_RESPLICAS is what is useful for admin. This metrics should alert users when there is a prolonged time of reduced capacity.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1922689613/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1922809960","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/12346#issuecomment-1922809960","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/12346","id":1922809960,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5ym8Bo","user":{"login":"snleee","id":27253407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MjUzNDA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27253407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/snleee","html_url":"https://github.com/snleee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snleee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snleee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snleee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snleee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snleee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snleee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snleee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snleee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snleee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-02T04:44:13Z","updated_at":"2024-02-02T04:44:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Jackie-Jiang @tibrewalpratik17 Please take a final look on this PR.

Yes, having a well defined definition is important. The \"high availability\" term I am using was refer to [hadoop HA definition](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HDFSHighAvailabilityWithNFS.html), which means running with 2 or more nodes for the same instance as active/standby(s). The issue is not exactly same as here and I am open to the naming.\r\n> > Theoretically, running with expected - 1 is what we always observe during real world node replacement. Probably track \"actual <= expected - 1\" as SEGMENTS_WITH_LESS_REPLICAS? And running with only 1 replica has far more risks than other <expected values (e.g. 2, 3 ...). Not sure if it is a overkill to track it separately.\r\n> \r\n> I think SEGMENTS_WITH_REDUCED_CAPACITY OR LESS_RESPLICAS is what is useful for admin. This metrics should alert users when there is a prolonged time of reduced capacity.\r\n\r\nYes, switched to \"SEGMENTS_WITH_LESS_REPLICAS\".\r\n\r\nThe failure in the integration test looks not related..","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1924507664/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1924772595","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/12353#issuecomment-1924772595","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/12353","id":1924772595,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5yubLz","user":{"login":"tibrewalpratik17","id":23629228,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjI5MjI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23629228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tibrewalpratik17","html_url":"https://github.com/tibrewalpratik17","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tibrewalpratik17/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tibrewalpratik17/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tibrewalpratik17/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tibrewalpratik17/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tibrewalpratik17/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tibrewalpratik17/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tibrewalpratik17/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tibrewalpratik17/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tibrewalpratik17/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-02T22:06:18Z","updated_at":"2024-02-02T22:06:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"cc @Jackie-Jiang ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1924772595/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1924884957","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/12304#issuecomment-1924884957","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/12304","id":1924884957,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5yu2nd","user":{"login":"dttung2905","id":28837684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4ODM3Njg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28837684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dttung2905","html_url":"https://github.com/dttung2905","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dttung2905/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dttung2905/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dttung2905/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dttung2905/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dttung2905/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dttung2905/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dttung2905/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dttung2905/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dttung2905/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-02T23:09:45Z","updated_at":"2024-02-02T23:09:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @walterddr for the detailed pointer.\r\nI take a look at the code and I think `validate` stage might be a good place to implement that check, something like \r\n```java\r\n  private SqlNode validate(SqlNode parsed, PlannerContext plannerContext)\r\n      throws Exception {\r\n    // 2. validator to validate.\r\n    SqlNode validated = plannerContext.getValidator().validate(parsed);\r\n    // Check for LIMIT clause in the main query\r\n    if (validated instanceof SqlSelect) {\r\n      SqlSelect sqlSelect = (SqlSelect) validated;\r\n      if (sqlSelect.getFetch() == null) {\r\n        // Add LIMIT 100 clause \r\n        SqlParserPos originalPos = sqlSelect.getParserPosition();\r\n        SqlNode limitNode = SqlLiteral.createExactNumeric(\"100\", originalPos);\r\n        ((SqlSelect) validated).setFetch(limitNode);\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    if (null == validated || !validated.getKind().belongsTo(SqlKind.QUERY)) {\r\n      throw new IllegalArgumentException(\r\n          String.format(\"unsupported SQL query, cannot validate out a valid sql from:\\n%s\", parsed));\r\n    }\r\n    return validated;\r\n  ```\r\nWhat do you think about this?
