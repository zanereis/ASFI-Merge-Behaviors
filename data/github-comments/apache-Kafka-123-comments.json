there is no version matrix being tested currently.  The older versions will be enabled once KAFKA-4507 has been committed.  I have tested them locally and they work once the code enabling client compatibility is in place.  The main goal of committing this now is shrinking the size of the patch for client compatibility, and breaking it down into multiple JIRAs.  It also means that this feature will get done quicker because we are not blocked when committing this test.  Once KAFKA-4507 is in, we will test a matrix of older
