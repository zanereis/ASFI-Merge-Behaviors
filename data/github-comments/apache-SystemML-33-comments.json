If yes, then I would prefer having a dml bodied function because then all other compilation and runtime techniques automatically apply. If it turns out that the dml version has performance or scalability issues, we can discuss to add a builtin function instead. In this case, we would need to break this endeavor into two steps of local and distributed operations. If you need this svd builtin immediately, you can workaround via a java-based external function that calls some local implementation.  \r\n\r\nJust as a background: Yes, there are builtin functions like solve, inverse, qr, lu, and eigen which only have local operations (by calling out to commons math). These functions were added for convenience but are typically only applied on small data. However, the missing distributed operations are unsatisfying because they do not adhere to the overall philosophy of SystemML. Moving forward, we would like to either add distributed operators for these operations or replace them by dml scripts which would automatically be compiled to distributed operations.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/316783609/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/316784275","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/575#issuecomment-316784275","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/575","id":316784275,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNjc4NDI3NQ==","user":{"login":"mboehm7","id":13721609,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzIxNjA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13721609?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7","html_url":"https://github.com/mboehm7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-20T18:04:38Z","updated_at":"2017-07-20T18:04:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"FullReblockTest is one of our flaky tests which unfortunately fails once in a while.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/316784275/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/316786469","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/582#issuecomment-316786469","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/582","id":316786469,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNjc4NjQ2OQ==","user":{"login":"j143-zz","id":20439730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDM5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20439730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143-zz","html_url":"https://github.com/j143-zz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143-zz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143-zz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143-zz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143-zz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143-zz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143-zz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143-zz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143-zz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143-zz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-20T18:12:53Z","updated_at":"2017-07-20T18:12:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mboehm7  thanks for looking into this.

WRT switching to calling BuildLiteExecution from the lite profile, I would say artifact maintentance would become very difficult (WRT issues such as licensing, included files, etc) since it would mean going from essentially our project's standard maven assembly technique for building our verified artifacts to a fairly convoluted programmatic technique. I think the lite.xml file used with the maven-assembly-plugin helps standardize how the artifact is built, which makes our release validation process easier. A side benefit of decoupling the actual BuildLiteExecution execution from the lite profile means that the artifact takes a few seconds to build rather than a few minutes.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/316865454/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/316883782","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/578#issuecomment-316883782","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/578","id":316883782,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNjg4Mzc4Mg==","user":{"login":"akchinSTC","id":13340013,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzQwMDEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13340013?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC","html_url":"https://github.com/akchinSTC","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-21T02:22:22Z","updated_at":"2017-07-21T02:22:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"\nRefer

@mboehm7 !\r\n1. May be we can consider one more thing here, Imran Younus has tried to implement the distributed svd() with the help of local svd( ) already in PR #273 , (which I believe is robust w/ acceptable accuracy, isn't it?) of the latest algorithm in the literature. \r\n\r\n2. It may be worthy of taking into account that too(?). Please give me, 20-25 hrs on studying the current literature that the distributed algorithm is using at its backbone, to understand whether the algorithm have any conflicts with distribution calculations at the matrix block level.\r\n\r\n3. Will it helps us understand when implementing the other functions, internal or external implementation that perform well in our setting?. As @nakul02 pointed out, we try the above implementations for POV of GPU too. \r\n\r\nPlease provide any thoughts. Thanks. :smile:
