I think that in all cases, it is necessary to start with a description why a particular package is opened.\r\n\r\nThe most controversial are cases where a package is opened publicly. Some cases (like opening org.netbeans.modules.openide.windows), seem to be simply undesirable, and any usecase which needed that should be implemented as a proper API enhancement.\r\n\r\nSpecifically on the org.netbeans.modules.openide.windows package: overriding GlobalActionContextImpl will affect the whole IDE, I believe, so some care needs to be taken. But I don't see why the package must be public. ServiceProvider allows to supersede (mask out) other implementation given their name, no need to make the package public.

It makes a huge difference. Here's my experience:\r\n\r\nAfter upgrading from NetBeans 8 to NetBeans 9, my multi-module NetBeans platform maven project would constantly need to be recompiled after errors like these:\r\n* java.lang.ClassFormatError: Duplicate method name&signature in class file\r\n* ClassFormatError: Absent Code attribute in method that is not native or abstract\r\n* NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class\r\n\r\nI then applied this patch in September, on top of NetBeans 9, and had no more problems with these errors.\r\n\r\nWhen NetBeans 10 was released, I started using it _without_ the patch for two weeks. The errors above started appearing daily again. It was a huge annoyance. I'm have now applied the patch again, and the errors are gone.\r\n\r\n(More usage background: I always use Compile-on-Save, and often also Apply Code Changes in the debugger. In my own project, the \"start state\" is always a clean maven build--but with the patch applied, I can go for several days without needing to do a clean build again. And when I do run a clean build, it's usually because I need to for an unrelated reason.)\r\n\r\n> While I continue to find the behavior in this patch preferable on balance to the stock behavior, it is sufficiently controversial that it should just be considered on hold until I can find time to spend on a more ambitious alternate approach.\r\n\r\nWhat is the main \"controversial\" aspect of this patch? Are there downsides to it?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/457602967/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/457603782","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/504#issuecomment-457603782","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/504","id":457603782,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NzYwMzc4Mg==","user":{"login":"geertjanw","id":5309985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMDk5ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5309985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw","html_url":"https://github.com/geertjanw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-25T15:11:59Z","updated_at":"2019-01-25T15:11:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Well, there are conflicting files now.

[...] which is done very well for Surefire [...]\r\n\r\nBy a listener that Surefire calls when tests are executed?\r\n\r\nNevertheless and as you have written in your blog, NetBeans should use the JUnit Platform Launcher API to start test runs. That's the sole purpose of it -- no need to depend on a plugin of a specific build tool that tries to \"find and execute\" tests in a \"custom\" way. Copied from the beginning of the User Guide:\r\n\r\n> The JUnit Platform serves as a foundation for launching testing frameworks on the JVM. It also defines the TestEngine API for developing a testing framework that runs on the platform. Furthermore, the platform provides a Console Launcher to launch the platform from the command line and build plugins for Gradle and Maven as well as a JUnit 4 based Runner for running any TestEngine on the platform.\r\n\r\nhttps://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/index.html#overview-what-is-junit-5\r\n\r\nAnd every new TestEngine, wrapping an existing test framework ([mainrunner](https://github.com/sormuras/mainrunner), [TestNG](https://github.com/testng-team/testng-junit5), Spock, JQWIK, ... https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/wiki/Third-party-Extensions#junit-platform-test-engines) or one that is invented tomorrow (JUnit 6 \"aka Saturn\") will be integrated in your build tool right-away. Zero effort.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/457919910/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/457923957","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1104#issuecomment-457923957","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/1104","id":457923957,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NzkyMzk1Nw==","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-27T14:47:46Z","updated_at":"2019-01-27T14:47:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The travis build is green now.
