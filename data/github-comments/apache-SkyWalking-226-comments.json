This is a prerequisite of my thoughts, does it work for you? If so:\r\n> \r\n> here is 2 typical uses of this image:\r\n> \r\n> * Traditional Docker deployment, something simply like `docker run application-based-on-this-agent`, or `docker-compose up`, under this scenario, building our agent based on `openjdk 8 / openjdk 11` is extremely helpful for users, read [#6686 (comment)](https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/6686#issuecomment-813799007) for the detailed usage.\r\n> * In Kubernetes as a sidecar, where we definitely can have an minimized image, say `apache/skywalking-java-agent:8.5.0-sidecar`, which based on `scratch / alpine`, and mounts the agent dir into the Pod where the main image resides.\r\n> \r\n> All of these 2 usages can be documented in repo [http://github.com/apache/skywalking-docker/](https://github.com/apache/skywalking-docker/) and I'll document them in [apache/skywalking-docker#17](https://github.com/apache/skywalking-docker/pull/17) if 👆 makes sense to you\r\n\r\nMake sense to me. Should we make two different images or three(jdk8/jdk11 base and sidecar) in this PR?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/814121786/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/814124907","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/6686#issuecomment-814124907","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/6686","id":814124907,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxNDEyNDkwNw==","user":{"login":"kezhenxu94","id":15965696,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTY1Njk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15965696?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94","html_url":"https://github.com/kezhenxu94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-06T13:35:33Z","updated_at":"2021-04-06T13:35:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Should we make two different images or three(jdk8/jdk11 base and sidecar) in this PR?\r\n\r\nWe don't need to do that inside this PR, the base image (jdk8 / jdk11, etc.) is parameterized now, so we can build with the same codes and same commands with different docker build-arg and tag them separately, this is how we're doing now for `es6` and `es7` images, and is how we're doing for Java agent E2E tests targeting different JDK versions","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/814124907/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/814139071","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/6686#issuecomment-814139071","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/6686","id":814139071,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxNDEzOTA3MQ==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-06T13:53:07Z","updated_at":"2021-04-06T13:53:07Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> > Should we make two different images or three(jdk8/jdk11 base and sidecar) in this PR?\r\n> \r\n> We don't need to do that inside this PR, the base image (jdk8 / jdk11, etc.) is parameterized now, so we can build with the same codes and same commands with different docker build-arg and tag them separately, this is how we're doing now for `es6` and `es7` images, and is how we're doing for Java agent E2E tests targeting different JDK versions\r\n\r\nSo, you are going to enhance the e2e later?

talk about this from a different perspective.\r\n> So how SkyWalking Java Agent can do in such extreme scenarios? Because the application availability is very important, all of us won't hope the APM instrument occupies a lot of memory.\r\n\r\nSkyWalking agent would provide a unlimited size of spans per segment, you could find the configuration in the agent, it would be 300 spans per segment mostly.\r\n\r\n> I wonder why put the segment in the ring buffer, could we put the span? I don't familiar with the Segment design purpose.\r\n\r\nIf you don't have this concept, you can't tell the links(metrics) between entry span and exit spans, such as one day, we may need N database operations per HTTP request. Also, your codes actually cache much more data than we did for tracing the context.\r\n**Unless, like in your case**, I would say you must put the parameter collection by yourself.

The list actually used about 356M in one TheadLocal.The situation is the same as other Dubbo threads that are sorted by percentage.\r\nThe docs said `private List<TraceSegmentRef> refs` used to link multi parents trace segments, the segment faces hundreds of thousands of parents is unusual unless a loop occurs.\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class TraceSegment {\r\n    private String traceSegmentId;\r\n    /**\r\n     * The refs of parent trace segments, except the primary one. For most RPC call, {@link #refs} contains only one\r\n     * element, but if this segment is a start span of batch process, the segment faces multi parents, at this moment,\r\n     * we use this {@code #refs} to link them.\r\n     * <p>\r\n     * This field will not be serialized.
