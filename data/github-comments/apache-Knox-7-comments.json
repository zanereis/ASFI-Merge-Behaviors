Perhaps changing it to `Lax` would be a compromise?\r\n\r\nThis will actually only break deployments that are relying on an insecure setting. Making this Strict by default is the same as the change that added Secure=true many years ago. In modern deployments, the SSO cookie is only being presented to Knox itself and to therefore to the same domain. This should not break deployments that are configured properly to do this.
