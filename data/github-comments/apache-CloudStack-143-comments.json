Hi, I think I used your changes here. VMware is sane to interpret Ubuntu guest vms as either ubuntuGuest or ubuntu64Guest (identifier used), while to XS and KVM full names are passed while may or may not exist. XenServer 6.5 and KVM/LXC may not understand/interpret Ubuntu 16.04 correctly so, the workaround here is to tell the hypervisor(s) to treat VMs of this guest os id/type to be a Ubuntu 14.04.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/250421476/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/250422372","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1688#issuecomment-250422372","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1688","id":250422372,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MDQyMjM3Mg==","user":{"login":"blueorangutan","id":16489489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDg5NDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16489489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan","html_url":"https://github.com/blueorangutan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-29T09:55:51Z","updated_at":"2016-09-29T09:55:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Packaging result: ✔centos6 ✔centos7 ✔debian.

@jburwell as I've already explained, there should be no need to enable dynamic apichecker if you're upgrading from an older system that has a commands.properties file. I think the upgrade tests was performed not using packages but maven/jetty. The current 4.9+ branch don't have commands.properties so when you rebuild mgmt server you don't get the commands.properties in the classpath. This has been documented in the admin docs as well. If you've installed 4.9+ based mgmt server on a new server, the old commands.properties file need to be copied to the new server to continue to use the static checker, otherwise the dynamic checker need to be enabled and migrated using a migration script as documented here: http://docs.cloudstack.apache.org/projects/cloudstack-administration/en/4.9/accounts.html#using-dynamic-roles\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/250510489/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/250514601","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1684#issuecomment-250514601","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1684","id":250514601,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MDUxNDYwMQ==","user":{"login":"jburwell","id":285646,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTY0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/285646?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell","html_url":"https://github.com/jburwell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-29T16:14:52Z","updated_at":"2016-09-29T16:15:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rhtyd discussing this issue with @PaulAngus, there is a scenario where this wedged condition can occur.  If you perform an upgrade by creating a new management server VM then no commands.properties file will be present and the dynamic API checker will be set to off.  This upgrade approach is taken as a best practice to provide a simple, reliable rollback strategy and an opportunity to perform OS upgrades.  I think the solution in this situation is combination of improved upgrade documentation (i.e. copy over your commands.properties or run the import script and turn on the dynamic role API checker) and some better error messages that will help admins understand how to remedy the problem.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/250514601/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/250521046","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1638#issuecomment-250521046","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1638","id":250521046,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MDUyMTA0Ng==","user":{"login":"blueorangutan","id":16489489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDg5NDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16489489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan","html_url":"https://github.com/blueorangutan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-29T16:35:27Z","updated_at":"2016-09-29T16:35:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<b>Trillian

isnt correct @bhaisaab.  commands.properties can be different on every mgmt server.  Cloudstack would not know which version to use.\n\n---\n\nFrom: Rohit Yadav notifications@github.com\nSent: 29 Sep 2016 18:16\nTo: apache/cloudstack\nCc: Paul Angus; Mention\nSubject: Re: [apache/cloudstack] CLOUDSTACK-9489: the new config vars that are added do not goto DB if… (#1684)\n\n@jburwellhttps://github.com/jburwell when a fresh mgmt server is deployed for upgrading an existing CloudStack environment, several files from /etc/cloudstack/management are copied to the new server, especially the db.properties file. The commands.properties is no different, in the past all such deployment (where in-place upgrades were avoided) copied all these config files in /etc/cloudstack/management from old server to new server.\n\nOfficial docs only talk about in-place upgrades, our packaging system (post-install/upgrade scripts) assume in-place upgrade as well; if someone's doing fresh mgmt server for upgrade, they know what they are doing and its out-of-scope of what the project can support. At the same time, we may add documentation for such kind of upgrades as well. The solution for this problem is documentation and release/upgrade notes.\n\n—\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1684#issuecomment-250531992, or mute the threadhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AEll7O8ks5aJSv3zEVnq9pNqLuZonMjBks5qu_JsgaJpZM4KEn6g.\n\nPaul Angus\nVP Technology\ns: +44 203 603 0540  |   m: +44 7711 418784  |   d: +44 203 468 5163\ne: paul.angus@shapeblue.com  |  w: www.shapeblue.com  |  t: @cloudyangus @shapeblue\na: 53 Chandos Place, Covent Garden, London  WC2N 4HSUK\n\nShape Blue Ltd is a company incorporated in England &amp; Wales.
