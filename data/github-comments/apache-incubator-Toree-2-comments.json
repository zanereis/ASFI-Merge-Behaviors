the travis issues/resolutions were (reflected in the latest commit):\n- when pip packaging make sure we run the containers as root (pip permission issues on writing)\n- I ran into the exact travis

service.  The possible resolutions are:\n  - Run tests with `oraclejdk7` instead of `openjdk7`.  `openjdk7` is the one causing the issue.
