One would have thought other default ports would have this problem.\r\n\r\nIt's a consequence of two things. First, we are no longer dockerizing test workers. Until a few weeks ago, each test worker ran in a separate docker container, and within each container fewer processes were competing for ports. Now that dozens of concurrently running tests compete for the same ports, we will see more port conflicts like this.\r\n\r\nSecond, very few tests use default ports, so there are likely to be few conflicts… except in stress tests, which pit multiple instances of a test against each other.\r\n\r\n> But perhaps, this test is flawed. Perhaps breaking it into a test of the default port number and a test of the starting up on a specified port would be more appropriate then altering our test framework?\r\n\r\nI chose this approach because it affects only tests that explicitly test the use of default ports. And my guess (or perhaps merely my hope) is that very few tests do that: Only one per service. So very few tests will use this technique to avoid stress. I hope.\r\n\r\nAs for altering the test framework, my assessment (for now) is that including these few tests in stress test runs isn't worth the extra complexity in the test framework.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/896141294/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/896152905","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/6748#issuecomment-896152905","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/6748","id":896152905,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAhObV841ajVJ","user":{"login":"mhansonp","id":26558973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTU4OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26558973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp","html_url":"https://github.com/mhansonp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-10T16:59:41Z","updated_at":"2021-08-10T16:59:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"\r\n> As for altering the test framework, my assessment (for now) is that including these few tests in stress test runs isn't worth the extra complexity in the test framework.\r\n\r\nI suggested that we modify this test to be repeated test capable rather than adding a new category which you have done.\r\n\r\nE.g.
