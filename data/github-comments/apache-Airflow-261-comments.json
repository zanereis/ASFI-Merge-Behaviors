is quite drastic change.\r\n\r\nWhile I agree it should be done, I think this change should also set do_xcom_push to `True` for all the operators that currently return a value from execute and do not have \"do_xcom_push\" set  (after checking that it's intentional). It should be rather safe and easy change.\r\n\r\nI think it's not enough to write it in updating.md in this case. There will be weird, unrelated problems if they do_xcom_push is set to False for DAGs that rely on it. Often you will see missing or empty value in a task that is further upstream and I imagine this to be nightmare to debug for huge DAGs.\r\n\r\nI did a quick search for operators that do not have *do_xcom_push* but they have some \"return\\s\\S.*$\" regexp. They might of course have false positives of course (but by quick look - not many). I think the list is large enough to worry, but small enough that such review and global change is actually doable in short time.\r\n\r\n```\r\n./airflow/sensors/base_sensor_operator.py\r\n./airflow/operators/hive_stats_operator.py\r\n./airflow/operators/druid_check_operator.py\r\n./airflow/operators/presto_check_operator.py\r\n./airflow/operators/pig_operator.py\r\n./airflow/operators/http_operator.py\r\n./airflow/operators/subdag_operator.py\r\n./airflow/operators/hive_operator.py\r\n./airflow/operators/python_operator.py\r\n./airflow/operators/check_operator.py\r\n./airflow/operators/docker_operator.py\r\n./airflow/operators/branch_operator.py\r\n./airflow/operators/s3_to_hive_operator.py\r\n./airflow/operators/dagrun_operator.py\r\n./airflow/operators/bash_operator.py\r\n./airflow/contrib/operators/sagemaker_model_operator.py\r\n./airflow/contrib/operators/adls_list_operator.py\r\n./airflow/contrib/operators/azure_container_instances_operator.py\r\n./airflow/contrib/operators/aws_athena_operator.py\r\n./airflow/contrib/operators/sagemaker_tuning_operator.py\r\n./airflow/contrib/operators/opsgenie_alert_operator.py\r\n./airflow/contrib/operators/sagemaker_training_operator.py\r\n./airflow/contrib/operators/qubole_check_operator.py\r\n./airflow/contrib/operators/jira_operator.py\r\n./airflow/contrib/operators/kubernetes_pod_operator.py\r\n./airflow/contrib/operators/s3_to_sftp_operator.py\r\n./airflow/contrib/operators/jenkins_job_trigger_operator.py\r\n./airflow/contrib/operators/databricks_operator.py\r\n./airflow/contrib/operators/grpc_operator.py\r\n./airflow/contrib/operators/snowflake_operator.py\r\n./airflow/contrib/operators/sftp_to_s3_operator.py\r\n./airflow/contrib/operators/s3_list_operator.py\r\n./airflow/contrib/operators/sftp_operator.py\r\n./airflow/contrib/operators/aws_sqs_publish_operator.py\r\n./airflow/contrib/operators/winrm_operator.py\r\n./airflow/contrib/operators/sagemaker_endpoint_config_operator.py\r\n./airflow/contrib/operators/sns_publish_operator.py\r\n./airflow/contrib/operators/wasb_delete_blob_operator.py\r\n./airflow/contrib/operators/s3_to_gcs_operator.py\r\n./airflow/contrib/operators/ssh_operator.py\r\n./airflow/contrib/operators/sagemaker_endpoint_operator.py\r\n./airflow/contrib/operators/qubole_operator.py\r\n./airflow/contrib/operators/sagemaker_transform_operator.py\r\n./airflow/contrib/operators/emr_create_job_flow_operator.py\r\n./airflow/contrib/operators/emr_add_steps_operator.py\r\n./airflow/contrib/operators/ecs_operator.py\r\n./airflow/contrib/operators/awsbatch_operator.py\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/538953236/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/538966226","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5779#issuecomment-538966226","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5779","id":538966226,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzODk2NjIyNg==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-07T11:36:33Z","updated_at":"2019-10-07T11:36:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I

@ashb : In the latest commit I have a really nice set of optimisations and simplifications for the docker image. \r\n\r\nNow we have simpler build scripts, less number of images, better caching, CI image is optimised for build time, PROD image is optimised for size. Plus we have bigger flexibility to choose what is only in PROD and what is in CI image. \r\n\r\nThere are quite a few changes (the basic framework remains the same and it has the same properties as before - including automated maintenance via github/dockerhub builds):\r\n\r\n1) I completely got rid of the SLIM_CI image. The way it was built, it only added complexity and in fact increased build/download size eventually. All static checks will now be done using CI image. \r\n\r\n2) I got rid of the \"if\" conditionals in the Docker image at the expense of some duplication (PROD/CI image has their own stages). Eventually the duplicated code is not going to change too much and we have now greater flexibility in deciding what goes into PROD and what goes into CI image. We do not need the CI_OPTIMISED flag any more.\r\n\r\n3) We have much simpler build scripts now - there is no need to pass base images as build args - it is rather straightforward now. We still have the build scripts, but basically the build command now looks like follows:\r\n`docker build --build-arg PYTHON_BASE_IMAGE=python:3.6-slim-buster --build-arg AIRFLOW_VERSION=2.0.0.dev0 --build-arg AIRFLOW_BRANCH=master -t potiuk/airflow:master-www --target airflow-prod` or `docker build --build-arg PYTHON_BASE_IMAGE=python:3.6-slim-buster --build-arg AIRFLOW_VERSION=2.0.0.dev0 --build-arg AIRFLOW_BRANCH=master -t potiuk/airflow:master-www --target airflow-ci`.\r\nOf course when we add efficient caching from dockerhub it becomes more complex (--cache-from) but this is all handled by the build scripts to add proper --cache-from directives and pull images as needed.\r\n\r\n4) I have separate `airflow-www` stage where I only run `npm ci` and `npm prod` on airflow/www and then i used `COPY --from=airflow-www` to copy appropriate parts to the right places (sources + node_modules + dist in CI image), (sources + dist) in PROD image. No NPM neither node_modules in PROD image :).\r\n\r\n5) I use `pip install --user`. This way all the dependencies are installed to ${HOME}/.local and it's easier to determine the folder to copy the npm to (it's python-version independent).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/539906026/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/539933343","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6287#issuecomment-539933343","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6287","id":539933343,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzOTkzMzM0Mw==","user":{"login":"TobKed","id":32594847,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNTk0ODQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32594847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobKed","html_url":"https://github.com/TobKed","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobKed/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobKed/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobKed/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobKed/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobKed/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobKed/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobKed/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobKed/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobKed/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-09T10:05:17Z","updated_at":"2019-10-09T10:05:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@milton0825
