Why is that a problem?\r\n> \r\n> One issue with auto deriving is that we can only derive the lowest level predicates, and not a combination if that was already applied. However, I am unsure we can get to that, so I am already trying to see if I can get rid of p1/p2/p3... in this PR (will update).\r\n\r\nAn advantage of explicitly specifying predicates is that complex predicates (with and/or) can be specified, and can be applied at once to the filtered docs, which improves performance. For example, p1 can be of form `(col1 = 1 and col2 = 'x')`, as opposed to two separate predicates `col1 = 1 and col2 = 'x'`.  In future if we support accepting the first form, it would probably be faster to apply that at once, as opposed to applying individual once, and then performing intersection of them using theta-sketches.\r\n\r\nBTW, I have updated the PR to make `p1, p2, p3...` optional, i.e. derive from `postAggregationExpression`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/625868385/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/625934612","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/5316#issuecomment-625934612","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/5316","id":625934612,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNTkzNDYxMg==","user":{"login":"mcvsubbu","id":2279037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzkwMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2279037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu","html_url":"https://github.com/mcvsubbu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-08T17:43:43Z","updated_at":"2020-05-08T17:43:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Is it possible to process the (thetasketch) aggregation if a filter tree is provided?
