I agree that is not acceptable to deserialize and serialize the entire payload just to change publish time (or any field). But, AFAIK, on the added method [`modifyMessageMetadata()`](https://github.com/lovelle/pulsar/blob/feature/set_publish_time_on_broker/pulsar-common/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/common/api/Commands.java#L265) the entire payload is just read until message metadata (which has a maximum possible size of 1Kb) and write the uint64 to the buffer (new epoch) and update the new checksum if present, I don't think this is a considerable overhead, please correct me if I'm wrong.\r\nI agree this behavior should be allowed to be turned on/off by client.\r\n\r\n2. Yep, nice catch up. Therefore, only the greater epoch would be the one present on metadata, isn't it?\r\n\r\n3. I think the answer to this might be 'it depends'. It depends in the way you think about the 'delayed messages' feature\r\n\r\n    I think adding a new field is a good solution, the only issue I can see here is that the consumer is related with the decision made by the producer of setting this new field, and the main goal of #3155 is to make delay on consumer messages regardless of the producer.\r\nAnyway, we can add a new optional field to set this 'publish time' set by default by the client, maybe with the ability to be modified by the user if they want? Another downside of this would be the producer must update pulsar client too and the consumer should be aware that the producer has been updated with new version.\r\n\r\n4. Yep, but depends on the meaning given to this specific field, either the current publish time or a new one, it depends if it means the epoch since the message has been created or the epoch since the user has created the message, for the former one we need to do what you said (do we have something that identifies the message as a published by replication?), but if it is the latter case I think we don't need to do anything more.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/450592375/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/450611106","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/3265#issuecomment-450611106","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/3265","id":450611106,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MDYxMTEwNg==","user":{"login":"ambition119","id":20353043,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzUzMDQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20353043?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambition119","html_url":"https://github.com/ambition119","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambition119/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambition119/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambition119/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambition119/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambition119/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambition119/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambition119/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambition119/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambition119/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-31T05:57:19Z","updated_at":"2018-12-31T05:58:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@sijie

have worked with @codelipenghui on debugging this issue. When the issue happened, following logging statements were found at broker.\r\n\r\n```\r\n15:10:00.028 [BookKeeperClientWorker-OrderedExecutor-22-0] WARN  org.apache.bookkeeper.client.LedgerHandle - Conditional update ledger metadata for ledger 153718 failed.\r\n15:10:00.029 [BookKeeperClientWorker-OrderedExecutor-22-0] WARN  org.apache.bookkeeper.client.LedgerRecoveryOp - Close ledger 153718 failed during recovery:\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo the `LedgerRecoveryException` received at producer side is coming from broker failing on updating ledger metadata when loading a topic - *Conditional update ledger metadata for ledger 153718 failed`.\r\n\r\n**Why this happened**\r\n\r\nThe *Conditional update failure* can happen when the ownership of a topic is transferred from one broker to the other broker. The transfer can be triggered by any events, for example topic reassigned when network is partitioned, load balancing and such. \r\n\r\nDuring this period, old owner is unloading the topic and closing the last ledger in the topic. Closing the ledger involves updating ledger metadata. The new owner is loading the topic, and recovering the last ledger in the topic. At the end of recovery, it will also close the ledger (which also updates ledger metadata). Concurrent metadata updates will trigger this \"conditional update\" failure. One update will succeed and the other update will fail. And broker and client don't have retry logics for this case, so the exception is popped all the way back to applications.\r\n\r\nThis issue will be fixed by bk 4.9.0 release, since bk 4.9.0 will handle conditional update failure on closing and will not throw exception. (/cc @ivankelly for confirmation)\r\n\r\nHowever I think at Pulsar side, there are a few improvements can be considered.\r\n\r\nfor example, at producer side, producer can potentially catch this exception and determine whether it should retry on this exception or not. If it can retry, the producer can retry it before popping the exception to applications.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/450814189/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/450866133","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/3277#issuecomment-450866133","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/3277","id":450866133,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MDg2NjEzMw==","user":{"login":"jiazhai","id":6348208,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNDgyMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6348208?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai","html_url":"https://github.com/jiazhai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-02T13:42:18Z","updated_at":"2019-01-02T13:42:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"#3278

#3118 is another change, and it is not intention to do the fix for this issue. If we want to do the fix in 2.2 or earlier, we may need another PR.\r\n\r\nAnd in the 2.2.1 code:\r\n```\r\n    public void start(PulsarClientImpl client, ConsumerBase<?> consumerBase, long

[isAckTimeout](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/v2.2.1-candidate-2/pulsar-client/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/client/impl/UnAckedMessageTracker.java#L162), it has already checked `oldOpenSet.isEmpty()`,  so the race window between \"< ===1\" and \"< ===2\" should be really small. it should be hard to trigger.\r\n\r\nDiscussed with @codelipenghui, the race is caused by an ACK from consumer between \"< ===1\" and \"< ===2\", and message is removed by remove():\r\n```\r\npublic boolean remove(MessageId m) {\r\n       readLock.lock();\r\n       try {\r\n           return currentSet.remove(m) || oldOpenSet.remove(m);\r\n       } finally {\r\n           readLock.unlock();\r\n       }\r\n
