I move some classes from `hudi-spark-datasource/hudi-spark` into `hudi-spark-datasource/hudi-spark-common` module to make reuse of these classes. And the `hudi` format under `spark-datasource/hudi-spark` module before is moved to `spark-datasource/hudi-spark-common` to reuse `DefaultSource` code. And I introduce `hudi` format which located in both `hudi-spark-datasource/hudi-spark2` and `hudi-spark-datasource/hudi-spark3` which means no matter which spark version users use, they use still use `hudi` format. since the `hudi-spark-datasource/hudi-spark` module depends on `hudi-spark-datasource/hudi-spark2` or `hudi-spark-datasource/hudi-spark3` module.

This is expected in 0.11.0 major release.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1001244186/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1001263459","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/4439#issuecomment-1001263459","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4439","id":1001263459,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM47rhFj","user":{"login":"waywtdcc","id":59957056,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5OTU3MDU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59957056?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/waywtdcc","html_url":"https://github.com/waywtdcc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waywtdcc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waywtdcc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waywtdcc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waywtdcc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waywtdcc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waywtdcc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waywtdcc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waywtdcc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waywtdcc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-27T00:26:27Z","updated_at":"2021-12-27T00:26:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I have fired a fix in #4443\r\n\r\nDoes hudi0.9 have this bug?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1001263459/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1001266146","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/4439#issuecomment-1001266146","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4439","id":1001266146,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM47rhvi","user":{"login":"danny0405","id":7644508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NDQ1MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7644508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405","html_url":"https://github.com/danny0405","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-27T00:40:45Z","updated_at":"2021-12-27T00:40:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> > I have fired a fix in #4443\r\n> \r\n> Does hudi0.9 have this bug?\r\n\r\nNo, but generally 0.10 is better.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1001266146/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1001267449","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/4439#issuecomment-1001267449","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4439","id":1001267449,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM47riD5","user":{"login":"waywtdcc","id":59957056,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5OTU3MDU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59957056?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/waywtdcc","html_url":"https://github.com/waywtdcc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waywtdcc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waywtdcc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waywtdcc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waywtdcc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waywtdcc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waywtdcc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waywtdcc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waywtdcc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waywtdcc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-27T00:46:44Z","updated_at":"2021-12-27T00:46:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"But we pay more attention to stability.
