 非常感谢您的关注\r\n\r\n应该是我前面没说清楚，我把我的需求和步骤明确以下，请您指点：\r\n\r\n我的需求是配置一个做client-verify-server's certificate的RocketMQ集群，且这个认证只发生在 Producer 或 Conmuser 与 Namsrv 或 Broker 交互时（Namesrv、Broker之间交互不做任何认证）\r\n\r\n按照我的理解，为了实现这个目标，需要做以下几点：\r\n\r\na. 在服务端设置参数 tls.server.need.client.auth=none 来关闭 server-verify-client's certificate  # 此处是我不能确定的地方，有可能我理解错了，请指教\r\n即在服务端设置如下JVM参数：tls.server.mode=permissive tls.config.file=/opt/xxx，在xxx文件中配置如下参数：\r\n    tls.test.mode.enable=false\r\n    tls.server.need.client.auth=none\r\n    tls.server.keyPath=/opt/server.key\r\n    tls.server.keyPassword=123456\r\n    tls.server.certPath=/opt/server.pem\r\n将服务器证书，中间根证书，根证书合并到 server.pem；用pkcs8将私钥打包加密为server.key；将2个文件复制到/opt目录下\r\n\r\nb. 在客户端设置 tls.enable=true 确保客户端发起TLS连接，设置 tls.client.authServer=true 确保客户端验证服务端服务器证书的有效性\r\n即在客户端设置参数：-Dtls.client.authServer=true -Dtls.enable=true -Dtls.test.mode.enable=false -Dtls.config.file=/opt/yyy，在yyy文件中配置如下参数：\r\n   tls.client.trustCertPath=/opt/ca.pem\r\n将根证书ca.pem文件复制到/opt目录下\r\n\r\n梳理一下\r\n\r\n服务端（Broker、Namesrv）的设置：\r\nJVM Option：-Dtls.server.mode=permissive -Dtls.config.file=/opt/xxx\r\nxxx文件内容：\r\n>     tls.test.mode.enable=false\r\n>     tls.server.need.client.auth=none\r\n>     tls.server.keyPath=/opt/server.key\r\n>     tls.server.keyPassword=123456\r\n>     tls.server.certPath=/opt/server.pem\r\n\r\n客户端（Producer、Consumer）的设置：\r\nJVM Option：-Dtls.client.authServer=true -Dtls.enable=true -Dtls.test.mode.enable=false

expect.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1175939893/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1175987306","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/4477#issuecomment-1175987306","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/4477","id":1175987306,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl85GGCRq","user":{"login":"azhsmesos","id":65518067,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTE4MDY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65518067?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/azhsmesos","html_url":"https://github.com/azhsmesos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azhsmesos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azhsmesos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azhsmesos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azhsmesos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azhsmesos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azhsmesos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azhsmesos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azhsmesos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azhsmesos/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-06T09:18:30Z","updated_at":"2022-07-06T09:18:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":">
