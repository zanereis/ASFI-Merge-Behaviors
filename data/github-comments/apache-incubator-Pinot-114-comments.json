But the query layer is deciding the evaluator instead of the storage layer.\r\n\r\nSpecifically on this, not really, the model has the potential to be far more generic than that. It’s more going from column to column + parameters + arbitrary sequence of storage layer API calls. \r\n\r\nThis is good, because within the context of an evaluator, the most efficient API calls can be made. Case in point: in DefaultJsonPathEvaluator it’s possible to avoid converting byte[] to String. It would also be possible to use hypothetical new zero copy (but unsafe) methods to read bytes on the basis that we don’t need to create a vector of JSON records, but a vector of JSON evaluation results. Individual evaluator implementations can be arbitrarily efficient (and complex) in a way that prevents the query layer from ever seeing any of this complexity, keeping the query layer clean just as it avoids trying to model all of the complex access patterns we might like in the storage layer with a single interface.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/982151840/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/982162356","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/7838#issuecomment-982162356","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/7838","id":982162356,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c46ipu0","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-30T00:29:43Z","updated_at":"2021-12-10T05:57:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/7838?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) Report\n> Merging [#7838](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/7838?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (f4c122a) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/commit/c999a23caae3e3769e1729d56da4c5c0de594b31?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (c999a23) will **increase** coverage by `6.18%`.\n> The diff coverage is `51.29%`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/7838/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&height=150&src=pr&token=4ibza2ugkz&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/7838?src=pr&el=tree&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation)\n\n```diff\n@@             Coverage Diff              @@\n##             master    #7838      +/-   ##\n============================================\n+ Coverage     65.07%   71.26%   +6.18%     \n  Complexity     4082     4082              \n============================================\n  Files          1538     1587      +49     \n  Lines         79993    82032    +2039     \n  Branches      12035    12259     +224     \n============================================\n+ Hits          52057    58460    +6403     \n+ Misses        24219    19603    -4616     \n- Partials       3717     3969     +252     \n```\n\n| Flag | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| integration1 | `29.12% <49.35%> (?)` | |\n| integration2 | `27.69% <50.32%> (?)` | |\n| unittests1 | `68.35% <47.28%> (-0.14%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| unittests2 | `14.41% <1.29%> (+<0.01%)` | :arrow_up: |\n\nFlags with carried forward coverage won't be shown.

We have violated this in few places and we should fix that. It might be a good idea to enhance the Block interface to allow a pushdown evaluator.\r\n\r\n@kishoreg this has been deviated from significantly already, and in many `Block` implementations there would be no sensible implementation but to throw `UnsupportedOperationException` which breaks LSP anyway. \r\n\r\nI also want to call out that there appears to be an element of complexity which you may have missed: `TransformFunction` isn't guaranteed to operate on directly on storage, it may also operate on the output of some other JSON function (I added a test for this) - when that happens, there needs to be an implementation which can operate on values produced by another `TransformFunction`. This (to push down or evaluate directly) is a decision which can only be made in the query layer. I'm not sure if you didn't mention this because it makes sense already or not.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/982559015/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/982651511","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/7842#issuecomment-982651511","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/7842","id":982651511,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c46khJ3","user":{"login":"richardstartin","id":16439049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDM5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16439049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin","html_url":"https://github.com/richardstartin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-30T13:46:49Z","updated_at":"2021-11-30T13:46:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi @Eywek how slow is \"very slow\"? \r\n\r\nIs there a natural way for you to filter the JSON documents before applying the `JSONEXTRACTSCALAR` and `REGEXP_LIKE` functions?

I think it should be possible to evolve towards what you want. I must admit that I don't see it right now, but I'm trying hard to find a way both to implement the suggestion and am thinking about the benefits. I want to make it very easy to implement storage plugins (as an idea incubation mechanism) without needing community consensus on the shape of SPIs like `ForwardIndexReader` which will affect a lot of stakeholders. A delegation chain of `TransformEvaluator`s, marked as an unstable interface, feels like a good way to iterate without stalling for consensus or imposing churn on stakeholders.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/983918350/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/984170266","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/7851#issuecomment-984170266","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/7851","id":984170266,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c46qT8a","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-02T00:07:20Z","updated_at":"2021-12-02T00:35:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/7851?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) Report\n> Merging [#7851](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/7851?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (35cb96c) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/commit/0290d74fe601f5784a5da2d0d82a16d186ae3f35?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (0290d74) will **decrease** coverage by `7.36%`.\n> The diff coverage is `90.90%`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/7851/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&height=150&src=pr&token=4ibza2ugkz&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/7851?src=pr&el=tree&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation)\n\n```diff\n@@             Coverage Diff              @@\n##             master    #7851      +/-   ##\n============================================\n- Coverage     71.70%   64.34%   -7.37%     \n+ Complexity     4088     4010      -78     \n============================================\n  Files          1580     1571       -9     \n  Lines         81093    80746     -347     \n  Branches      12068    12030      -38     \n============================================\n- Hits          58145    51953    -6192     \n- Misses        19032    25091    +6059     \n+ Partials       3916     3702     -214     \n```\n\n| Flag | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| integration1 | `29.47% <45.45%> (-0.04%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| integration2 | `27.93% <45.45%> (+0.09%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| unittests1 | `68.74% <90.90%> (-0.01%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| unittests2 | `?` | |\n\nFlags with carried forward coverage won't be shown.

Writing the array copies from the enormous array maintained by `DataBlockCache` (because it doesn't have enough information to size the result properly) to the correctly sized arrays in `JsonExtractScalarFunction` made me want to cry ever so slightly. \r\n\r\nPlease pay attention to the changes to the cache key in `DataBlockCache` - JSONPath evaluations need to be discriminated by both the JSON Path itself and the default value, on top of the column name and type of the result. This is probably better than having large JSON documents lingering in the cache, but I'm struggling to see this cache as an unequivocal benefit for every possible transformation. \r\n\r\nCould we avoid caching JSON path evaluations at the block level and revert the commit?

Ideally we should deduplicate the expression during the query planning, and have only one transform function for each unique expression. Then we can remove the cache and avoid all the unnecessary overhead.\r\n\r\nTowards this direction, I agree we should maintain the buffer within the transform layer and push the buffer down through the data fetcher. We should think of a smooth way to change the interface and move to the end state where all the transform functions (with or without an evaluator) can pass down the buffer to fill the values.\r\n\r\nFor now, we might just add some read methods into the `ProjectionBlock` so that it can be used by the `TransformFunction`? Adding these methods to the `Block` interface might not match our end goal.\r\n\r\nDo you see a path how we can move to the end state without making temporary changes to the

Adding these methods to the Block interface might not match our end goal.\r\n\r\nThis is what the PR originally did, I did not modify the `Block` interface and added methods to the concrete `ProjectionBlock`, but it was requested above to ensure substitutability of different block types. It feels like I am violating an aspirational design principle with this PR, but as far as I can tell, it has been violated for a long time. A lot of good things will follow on from the ability to tunnel down to the storage, so I would like to find a way to progress here.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/985428914/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/985445101","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/7820#issuecomment-985445101","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/7820","id":985445101,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c46vLLt","user":{"login":"richardstartin","id":16439049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDM5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16439049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin","html_url":"https://github.com/richardstartin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-03T11:31:04Z","updated_at":"2021-12-03T11:31:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@Jackie-Jiang please see https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/7820/commits/83dc232fc5d89dc1331437bc444512bfcd519eec - it removes `pushDown` from the `Block` interface.

That is, the code you’re measuring may not execute. There may be a side effect in the invocation of the method which prevents dead code elimination.\r\n\r\nA good way to spot this is to ask yourself how many cycles must the measured code have taken at your processor frequency. Assuming your processor frequency is 4GHz, 0.5ns is 2 cycles, which isn’t enough to have made even a userspace function call to to read a clock.\r\n\r\nYou will get different results if you return the value:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n @Benchmark\r\n  public long benchmarkThreadCpuTimer() {\r\n    ThreadTimer threadTimer = new ThreadTimer();\r\n    long totalThreadCpuTimeNs = threadTimer.getThreadTimeNs();\r\n    return totalThreadCpuTimeNs;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @Benchmark\r\n  public long benchmarkSystemCurrentTimeMillis() {\r\n    long startWallClockTimeMs = System.currentTimeMillis();\r\n    long totalWallClockTimeMs = System.currentTimeMillis() - startWallClockTimeMs;\r\n    long totalWallClockTimeNs = TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS.toNanos(totalWallClockTimeMs);\r\n   return totalWallClockTimeNs;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @Benchmark\r\n  public long benchmarkSystemNanoTime() {\r\n    long startWallClockTimeNs = System.nanoTime();\r\n    long totalWallClockTimeNs = System.nanoTime() - startWallClockTimeNs;\r\n    return startWallClockTimeNs;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSystem.currentTimeMills() and System.nanoTime() generally do *not* require a syscall because they call in to clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME) and clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC) respectively which have been in vDSO for a very long time. When these clocks are userspace calls, you should expect latencies of 20-30ns. When they are syscalls expect hundreds of nanoseconds. To see what actual syscall overhead looks like, run the fixed benchmark on a virtualised instance using a ‘xen’ clocksource and you will see the difference.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/985992967/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/985996820","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/7866#issuecomment-985996820","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/7866","id":985996820,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c46xR4U","user":{"login":"richardstartin","id":16439049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDM5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16439049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin","html_url":"https://github.com/richardstartin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-04T09:19:01Z","updated_at":"2021-12-04T09:19:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"In
