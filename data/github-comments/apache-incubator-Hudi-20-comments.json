We write parquet files and then upon successful writing of all attempted parquet files, we actually make the commit as completed. (i.e not inflight anymore). So this is normal. This is done to prevent queries from reading partially written parquet files..\r\n\r\nDoes that mean: \r\n1. Some file inflight may never reach commit? \r\n2. In occasion which inflight and parquet file generated by inflight still exists,  the global dedup will not dedup based on such kind file?\r\n3. In occasion which inflight and parquet file generated by inflight still exists,  the correct query result will be decided by read config(I mean mapreduce.input.pathFilter.class in sparksql)\r\n4.

Something could be wrong with the setup for the realtime table to not be created by the hive sync tool automatically. if you take a look at the quickstart here : https://hudi.apache.org/docker_demo.html#step-3-sync-with-hive, it shows how both the tables should be created. \r\n\r\nCan you create a new table with MERGE_ON_READ storage type and try syncing it again just to confirm that it doesn't work ? \r\n\r\nOn a side note, since you've anyways made the realtime table work, let me explain why you might not be seeing the latest records.\r\nCompaction process is just used to convert the delta files into a columnar file format such as parquet. \r\nYou should be able to query the latest records from the \"_rt\" table, like \"select * from your_table_rt\" even without running compaction. My suspicion is that you are creating new partitions every time you insert new records. You can confirm this by performing a `ls` on the base path. If you see a new folder for every new record, this is the case. If there are new partitions created, you will need to run the hive sync tool everytime to register the hive partitions against the hive metastore. So try doing the following : \r\n\r\n// insert records\r\n// call hive sync tool\r\n// inser records\r\n// call hive sync tool\r\n\r\nIdeally, you can just write a wrapper job that invokes insert and hive sync tool one after another to avoid doing this manually. Hope this helps.\r\n\r\nAlso, let's try to resolve this ticket here but going forward, please ask questions on the mailing list for faster responses (https://hudi.apache.org/community.html)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/486884444/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/486908775","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/654#issuecomment-486908775","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/654","id":486908775,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NjkwODc3NQ==","user":{"login":"zk19930911","id":45647545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjQ3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45647545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zk19930911","html_url":"https://github.com/zk19930911","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zk19930911/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zk19930911/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zk19930911/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zk19930911/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zk19930911/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zk19930911/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zk19930911/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zk19930911/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zk19930911/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-26T03:03:02Z","updated_at":"2019-04-26T03:03:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"0.4.5version;I refer to HoodieClientExample class，\r\ncode is\r\n       newCommitTime = client.startCommit();\r\n       logger.info(\"Starting commit \" + newCommitTime);\r\n       records.addAll(dataGen.generateUpdates(newCommitTime, 100));\r\n       writeRecords = jsc.<HoodieRecord>parallelize(records, 1);\r\n       client.upsert(writeRecords, newCommitTime);\r\n60s upsert once\r\nMany small parquet files  in per upsert\r\n\r\nHow to merge many small parquet files in per upsert ?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/486908775/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/486930807","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/654#issuecomment-486930807","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/654","id":486930807,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NjkzMDgwNw==","user":{"login":"n3nash","id":2722167,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MjIxNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2722167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash","html_url":"https://github.com/n3nash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-26T05:28:35Z","updated_at":"2019-04-26T05:29:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@zk19930911 \r\nCan you please share your HoodieWriteConfig ?

All it must be doing is to use more bits as more entries come in. you can use something like https://krisives.github.io/bloom-calculator/ to design a case around this.. \r\n\r\nIf proven to work, yes we should enable DynamicBloom by default. I think we have to do option 1 right? In option 2 also we 'd be reading old and new files with different filter formats right? do we handle an exception and detect dynamic vs normal bf?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/490112102/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/490112605","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/666#issuecomment-490112605","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/666","id":490112605,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MDExMjYwNQ==","user":{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-07T14:49:23Z","updated_at":"2019-05-07T14:49:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Have you serialized both the filters and see if the you can read a serialized DynamicBloomFilter as a BloomFilter?
