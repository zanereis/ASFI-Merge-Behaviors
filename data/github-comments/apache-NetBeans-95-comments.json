They have the closest [proximity](http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/Proximity) possible. Different versions are unlikely to work with each other. [NetBeans Runtime Container](http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/NetBeans_Runtime_Container) has other ways to hide the implementation - not expose its packages to public. \r\n\r\nWith two modules we are facing classloading issues: when the `javax/tools/ToolProvider` from Javac API is using `ServiceLoader`, it may not find the right implementation, but rather an implementation from the JDK. That doesn't happen with a single module.\r\n\r\nWe have problems with enabling/disabling. Both the API and the Impl need to be enabled & disabled at once (ability to disable the `nbjavac` requested by Michael). While it might be possible to use autoload/eager properly, putting both JARs into the same module solves the problem without any intricate hassle.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/979048374/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/979235765","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/3251#issuecomment-979235765","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/3251","id":979235765,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M46XfO1","user":{"login":"sdedic","id":26788611,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg4NjEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26788611?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic","html_url":"https://github.com/sdedic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-25T13:56:16Z","updated_at":"2021-11-25T13:56:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I would recommend to consider moving\r\n```\r\nOpenIDE-Module-Recommends: org.netbeans.libs.nbjavac\r\n```\r\nfrom `java.kit` to `java.source.base` - so that in any situation that depend on java src model nbjavac gets activated, if possible.

There's a reason for the gradients that I hadn't explained before.\r\n\r\nThe problem is to make the relationship between the tab and the editor visually clear, as well as clearly showing which tab is selected. Having mocked up various different styles, I came to a couple of conflusions:\r\n1) The background color of the bottom of the tab card needs to connect with the background color of the pane below (as mentioned before). And...\r\n2) The background color of the selected tab needs to be brighter than the unselected tabs.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the editor toolbar is the same brightness as the unselected tab background color. Changing the background colors of the editor toolbar or the draggable spaces between the TopComponents did not look good, in part because there are three levels of surfaces involved (application toolbar and unselected tab area, the editor toolbar, and the editor). The solution was to put a gradient on the selected tab, so the top could be made brighter and the tab would stand out.\r\n\r\nAs for the borders, these are actually _more_ consistent with the rest of the window than the previous style, because there are already borders around each TopComponent. If there are borders around each TopComponent, having them continue around the tab card looks good:\r\n\r\n![Continues](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/886243/143907223-b2e942e0-4ef7-4b9c-97e3-46a2f9f72669.png)\r\n\r\nIf we really wanted to get rid of borders, we'd need to remove them from the space between the TopComponents as well. (See the Unity screenshot for an example of that.

The folders represent the runtime platform, and are unrelated to the source level supported by the Java parser. (If the selected Java parser does not support the source level, the test will be skipped anyway, but I think we are heading to a place where this won't happen normally.) I realize this is fairly confusing.\r\n\r\nOtherwise looks good!\r\n\r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/983010061/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/983134986","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/3228#issuecomment-983134986","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/3228","id":983134986,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M46mXMK","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-30T23:57:48Z","updated_at":"2021-11-30T23:57:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@jlahoda thanks jan!
