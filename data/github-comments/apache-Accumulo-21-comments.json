The ones I am specifically experiencing are the `Saw consecutive COMPACTION_FINISH events` and `COMPACTION_FINISH (without preceding COMPACTION_START) is not followed by a successful minor compaction`.  Are exceptions the way to go with these or would logging be a better option since replaying the mutations is important?

In both cases, these exceptions could be thrown as a false positive, when there is no data to recover for that tablet, because the WAL containing the `COMPACTION_START` event could have been garbage collected.\r\n\r\nWorse, this scenario may not be tested for, because our continuous ingest tests don't ever stop writing to a tablet.\r\n\r\nThe workaround would be to inspect the WALs and verify that there is no data for the tablet which produced the exception during recovery, and remove the entries in the affected tablet, and to repeat for each affected tablet. This is not ideal, but if somebody can verify that this is what is happening (it's still just speculation right now), we could proceed with a fix for 1.9.2. The good news is that there shouldn't be any data loss, if this is what is happening. It's just an error when there's no data necessary to recover.\r\n\r\nSome possible fixes we discussed, if the issue can be verified:\r\n\r\n1. Check that there are no data events in the WALs for that tablet, before throwing the exception.\r\n2. Don't mark a WAL inactive prematurely, even if it has only a `COMPACTION_START` event with no data.\r\n\r\nMore investigation is needed to verify the problem, and possible fixes, though.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/398871117/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/398875091","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/535#issuecomment-398875091","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/535","id":398875091,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5ODg3NTA5MQ==","user":{"login":"adamjshook","id":1372828,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzI4Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1372828?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamjshook","html_url":"https://github.com/adamjshook","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamjshook/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamjshook/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamjshook/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamjshook/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamjshook/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamjshook/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamjshook/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamjshook/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamjshook/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-20T19:51:55Z","updated_at":"2018-06-20T19:51:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks, @ctubbsii.

GitHub PRs are their own issue. Sometimes it's useful to create an issue for future work.\r\n* It is not necessary to close a PR and create a new one to change the branch. You can click the \"Edit\" button and select a different branch to do the PR against from the drop-down.\r\n* When you use the form \"ACCUMULO-NNN\", it automatically links against the JIRA issue with that ID, and that JIRA issue (such as https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ACCUMULO-551) may be completely unrelated. GitHub issues are mentioned using the pound syntax: #551\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/402890953/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/402891217","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/553#issuecomment-402891217","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/553","id":402891217,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMjg5MTIxNw==","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-06T00:40:06Z","updated_at":"2018-07-06T00:40:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Do you know if a similar issue affects the 2.0 monitor?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/402891217/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/402893907","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/553#issuecomment-402893907","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/553","id":402893907,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMjg5MzkwNw==","user":{"login":"EdColeman","id":7047700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDc3MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7047700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman","html_url":"https://github.com/EdColeman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-06T00:58:42Z","updated_at":"2018-07-06T00:58:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The code for 2.0 has changed such that I do not see the same issue -

Looking back, I have it all sorted out in my mind now.  I am writing up a summary of my understanding in this comment.\r\n\r\nFor each tablet there are three different sets of active WALogs. While a WALog exist in anyone of these sets it must not be garbage collected.  The following are the three sets.\r\n\r\n  1. WALogs related to the tablets active in memory map\r\n  2. WAlogs related to the tablets inactive in memory map that is in the process of being minor compacted\r\n  3. WAlogs related to a newly minor compacted file that is in the process of being added to the tablets row in the metadata table.\r\n\r\nFrom Accumulo [1.8.0,1.9.0] only set 1 was consulted to determine what WALogs were active for a tablet.  In #443 the code was changed to also consider set 2, however this may have introduced a possible deadlock in the code.   So 1.9.1 consults sets 1 and 2, but may have a deadlock.  This PR also considers set 3 and fixes the deadlock.   So 1.9.2 consults sets 1,2,and 3 w/o having a deadlock.
