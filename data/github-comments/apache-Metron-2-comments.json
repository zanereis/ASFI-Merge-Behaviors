Thanks for the PR. \n\nLately, I'm a little reluctant to add ignore_errors without a fail block immediately following. In this case, you could add a register: result to the Upload grok patterns task followed by a fail task that fails if \"File exists\" isn't in stdout. That would make sure it didn't ignore different types of errors.\n\nSince we're interacting with hdfs immediately prior to the file copy, I think ignore_errors would be okay here, but if you had the time to add the fail block, it would be preferred. It demonstrates the preferred pattern and gives others a better example to follow.\n\nWhat do you think?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/202388095/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/202630163","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/62#issuecomment-202630163","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/62","id":202630163,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwMjYzMDE2Mw==","user":{"login":"yibter","id":373458,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MzQ1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/373458?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yibter","html_url":"https://github.com/yibter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yibter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yibter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yibter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yibter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yibter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yibter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yibter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yibter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yibter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-28T23:47:27Z","updated_at":"2016-03-28T23:47:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sounds like a plan @dlyle65535!

The packet capture process differs from the rest of the sensors that we have to date and requires a bit of special treatment.\n- This packet capture process is overkill and too cumbersome in demo/test environments.  It is really only useful for high-throughput production environments.\n- Using kernel bypass technology like this means that the packet capture process does not share well with others.  No other sensors leveraging libpcap drivers can share the same network interface.\n- Packet capture would most always run on a node isolated from the rest of your cluster.  The cluster could be running CentOS 6 while this runs on CentOS 7.  \n- This process has to be run close to your data.  I don't foresee this running \"in the cloud.\" It could potentially be used in a hybrid cloud deployment sending data from a secured network to the cloud.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/208918491/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/209475361","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/73#issuecomment-209475361","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/73","id":209475361,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwOTQ3NTM2MQ==","user":{"login":"merrimanr","id":311928,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTkyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/311928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr","html_url":"https://github.com/merrimanr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-13T14:31:15Z","updated_at":"2016-04-13T14:31:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1
