However, this still doesn't explain why @coolderli were seeing the duplicate transactions.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/913751666/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/913786246","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3073#issuecomment-913786246","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3073","id":913786246,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX842d0WG","user":{"login":"WinkerDu","id":11454734,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDU0NzM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11454734?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WinkerDu","html_url":"https://github.com/WinkerDu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WinkerDu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WinkerDu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WinkerDu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WinkerDu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WinkerDu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WinkerDu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WinkerDu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WinkerDu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WinkerDu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-06T17:35:30Z","updated_at":"2021-09-06T17:35:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11454734/132249412-6174fc2f-ae0d-47c3-96f6-f85ec7197b92.png)\r\nchecked the ci log, not sure why it was cancelled.

Can we please use `as-of-timestamp` instead of introducing a new configuration option? If users need to be strictly greater than some time or strictly less than some time, I believe they can use `as-of-timestamp` and simply add one to the milliseconds as we don’t store snapshot timestamps at a lower granularity than milliseconds iirc (will double check the spec but I’m almost certain).\r\n> \r\n> We need `as-of-timestamp` to be consistent with the batch API and Flink streaming APIs anyway and it already exists.\r\n> \r\n> If there's a motivating reason that we _can't_ use `as-of-timestamp`, I'd love to hear it.

Using this flag - users would read full table data.\r\nwhereas - the new flag `stream-from-timestamp` is for streaming reads.

> Can we please use `as-of-timestamp` instead of introducing a new configuration option? If users need to be strictly greater than some time or strictly less than some time, I believe they can use `as-of-timestamp` and simply add one to the milliseconds as we don’t store snapshot timestamps at a lower granularity than milliseconds iirc (will double check the spec but I’m almost certain).\r\n> > We need `as-of-timestamp` to be consistent with the batch API and Flink streaming APIs anyway and it already exists.\r\n> > If there's a motivating reason that we _can't_ use `as-of-timestamp`, I'd love to hear it.

Using this flag - users would read full table data.\r\n> whereas - the new flag `stream-from-timestamp` is for streaming reads.

Thanks for clarifying. Can we put something similar to your last line (`We need this config as opposed to `as-of-timestamp` as we only want to get data written after the specified timestamp`) as a comment?\r\n\r\nIt's clear now that it's said, but it was admittedly a little confusing for me prior to that. I'll leave any clarification up to you two.

I think the `iterms-per-bin` proposed from you team is trying to resolve the unbalanced issue, but I'm concerning it's hard to set the correct `iterms-per-bin` value for a given table in real production environment, because the `iterms-per-bin` is still controlling the data file's count. We actually don't have a real suitable approach to evaluate the cost about joining the data file size & its delete records. I think we need more accurate approach to decide which scan tasks should be dispatched to different tasks.\r\n\r\nI need to spend some time looking closer at the test cases (and probably try this out on some V2 tables), but I share the concern that this config value might be really hard to determine in a production env. Especially for example Flink users who have CDC streams, often times databases will experience a burst of deletes / updates due to some cron schedule and will then have an outsized number of delete files for a period of time (assuming partitioned by time as well).\r\n\r\nWondering how we would go about picking a good number (or how often one would need to set a non-standard number, or change the number for individual sections of the table).\r\n\r\nThat said, I'm also not adverse to adding another argument to make bin packing more useful in the near-term while we figure out the best way to have a more \"V2 native\" algorithm / parameter set.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/915492512/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/915508215","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3078#issuecomment-915508215","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3078","id":915508215,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX842kYv3","user":{"login":"kbendick","id":9833362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MzMzNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9833362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick","html_url":"https://github.com/kbendick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-08T19:24:47Z","updated_at":"2021-09-08T19:24:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":">

A symptom of the problem is that it isn't obvious how to set the maximum number of items per bin.\r\n\r\nI think that the right approach to solve the problem is to modify the weight function that we use for splits, _not_ to modify the bin packing algorithm itself.\r\n\r\nA straightforward way to fix this problem is to make the weight function take into account how much of a penalty a delete file is. Right now, the weight function is this, in `TableScanUtil`:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    Function<FileScanTask, Long> weightFunc = file -> Math.max(file.length(), openFileCost);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat could easily be updated so that each delete file that must be opened is added to the open cost:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    Function<FileScanTask, Long> weightFunc = file -> Math.max(file.length(), (1 + file.deletes().size()) * openFileCost);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother option is to check the size of the delete data as well:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    Function<FileScanTask, Long> weightFunc = file -> Math.max(\r\n        file.length() + file.deletes().stream().mapToLong(ContentFile::fileSizeInBytes).sum(),\r\n        (1 + file.deletes().size()) * openFileCost);\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet's try those options instead of modifying bin packing. I think modifying the packing algorithm is the wrong direction.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/915646119/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
