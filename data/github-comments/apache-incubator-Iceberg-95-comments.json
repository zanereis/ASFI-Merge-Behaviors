That will likely complement well with what I have, though it might need some tweaking. I'm opening a ticket now, but I will try to get my stuff up early next week for review and then we can iterate from there? We don't necessarily have to use my setup even, but it's probably the lowest common denominator while still being fully featured. The one big thing it's missing currently is a notebook server, which I was going to add, but in the interest of getting it up for discussion and community review, I'll just go with the basics. cc'ing you and the folks you mentioned on the ticket now!

Mine runs entirely locally via docker-compose (HDFS, Hive Metastore backed by Postgres, Spark, Zookeeper, and WIP on Kafka for streaming) and has been really useful for mounting in my local iceberg codebase to test things without having to publish jars beyond maven local repo. Theirs also uses docker-compose, but runs via notebooks (which I think is great). There's is more Nessie focused, but has the added advantage of being able to run on Google code lab without the need for your own infra as local docker development can definitely slow down a laptop.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to comment here and I will prioritize pushing what I have (I just need to remove some internal stuff) so that we can then iterate from there or regroup and come up with a better design. I'm sure given the large number of components that this will be an on going effort.

So a notebook is hosted on google colab and it locally starts spark and needed infra. Admittedly its not distributed and it wouldn't be easy to get Hive started in that way. @snazy also [added testing](https://github.com/projectnessie/nessie-demos/tree/main/notebook-tests) to our demo notebooks which has turned into a great pre-release smoke test\r\n\r\nIve seen some pretty involved docker and docker-compose demos that are cool but require a dozen docker images to be started locally.

Maybe there is room for both too: quick, short, focused demos and a bigger integrated one to get a feel for waht its like to run in prod\r\n\r\nI agree. When myself and @rdblue were discussing this a while back, we wanted to keep things as simple as possible, particularly for the demo. So ideally just the bare mininum (a runtime, even if not distributed, and a catalog - ideally the simplest possible).\r\n\r\nI believe there are issues when using derby in memory (though possibly those have been corrected and I only recently reencountered them when using an older iceberg version).\r\n\r\nThe setup I have is definitely more of a dev environment in that sense (3 or 4 images), but I'll see what I can do about getting it paired down. Once I've pushed the stuff I have early next week, we can go from there. I'm by no means married to the stuff I have currently, but do think it would be a good starting off point.\r\n\r\nI'll also take a look at the smoke tests etc in yours and see what can be done to help simplify mine.\r\n\r\nI agree that it might make sense to have both: something simple that people can just stand up without any nonsense, and then execute the basic Iceberg commands to get a feeling for what it's all about, as well as something that might be a bit more full featured (e.g. with Hive, etc) that people can look to to get an understanding of a more full setup. It would also allow for showing people in a more practical sense the various catalogs (i.e. something that runs with the Glue Catalog as well, etc).\r\n\r\nPerhaps some of it might be better suited for the wiki too, where a base setup that's slightly more complex might be desired.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/854918867/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/854981706","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2672#issuecomment-854981706","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2672","id":854981706,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg1NDk4MTcwNg==","user":{"login":"TGooch44","id":1591711,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTE3MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1591711?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TGooch44","html_url":"https://github.com/TGooch44","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TGooch44/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TGooch44/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TGooch44/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TGooch44/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TGooch44/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TGooch44/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TGooch44/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TGooch44/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TGooch44/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-04T20:28:36Z","updated_at":"2021-06-04T20:28:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @rymurr @TGooch44 Here is the PR to update conversions.\r\n> BTW, looks like decimal type is not supported and is commented out in the code.

The build.gradle is based on the one in your PR, but I had to make some modifications in order to get the Spark 3.1 tests in spark3 and spark3-extensions to actually run (before that, they were not getting run, so we were only testing Spark 3.0).\r\n@rdblue please take a look and see if you are fine with this approach.

We could pick a file if it is optimal in size but requires us to apply a lot of delete files on scan.

Tried to go through the PR, but this one is huge 😄 \r\n\r\nSome general takeaways:\r\n- Can we keep the original signatures for the extended methods as well? They still can call the new ones, but if we kept the original ones then we do not have to change the callers to add `null, null` which could reduce the number of changes greatly\r\n- Can we decrease the number of parameters we push down the new methods? I would prefer to send a boolean `useRelativePath` instead of the whole property list, or even only send just the baseLocation if we have to use it.\r\n- Would it be possible to hide the whole stuff inside a LocationProvider? It could be a base implementation for all of the LocationProviders, and would be a natural place in my opinion. We can avoid changing the public APIs if we provide a default implementation.\r\n- If there is any way to split this PR to smaller, more reviewer friendly ones that would be a big help for us, reviewers.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nPeter","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/857548271/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/857650453","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2689#issuecomment-857650453","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2689","id":857650453,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg1NzY1MDQ1Mw==","user":{"login":"TGooch44","id":1591711,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTE3MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1591711?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TGooch44","html_url":"https://github.com/TGooch44","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TGooch44/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TGooch44/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TGooch44/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TGooch44/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TGooch44/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TGooch44/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TGooch44/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TGooch44/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TGooch44/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-09T12:25:51Z","updated_at":"2021-06-09T12:25:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi Jun, I think I have a very similar PR queued up on this.

But stick to running the tests as they're mentioned in the test comments. This does not introduce any new issues with the JMH tests, other than possibly the added number of tests if one runs `./gradlew jmh` by itself (which is not guaranteed to run to completion anyway with the current state in master).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/858082399/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/858082551","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/2687#issuecomment-858082551","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2687","id":858082551,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg1ODA4MjU1MQ==","user":{"login":"aimenglin","id":84943281,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0OTQzMjgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84943281?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aimenglin","html_url":"https://github.com/aimenglin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aimenglin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aimenglin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aimenglin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aimenglin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aimenglin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aimenglin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aimenglin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aimenglin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aimenglin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-09T20:35:20Z","updated_at":"2021-06-09T20:35:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@marton-bod Thank you for the guide.

Both of them failed eventually, but after running for 20-25 minutes and completing at least 3-4 of the benchmarks each time. @RussellSpitzer has now been able to get plain `./gradle jmh` to run for over an hour now on this PR branch.\r\n> \r\n> When I run an individual test, as recommended in the comments of each test (or above), it runs just fine to completion.\r\n> \r\n> I think it's more an issue with gradle JVM settings and then running out of memory or other resources, possibly with the number of forked threads when running all of the benchmarks for all of the requested iterations.\r\n> \r\n> **TLDR:** I don't think we should run `jmh` itself to run _all_ tests without better configuring gradle. But stick to running the tests as they're mentioned in the test comments. This does not introduce any new issues with the JMH tests, other than possibly the added number of tests if one runs `./gradlew jmh` by itself (which is not guaranteed to run to completion anyway with the current state in master).\r\n\r\nFurther follow up - @RussellSpitzer and I were both able to get the tests to run to completion, but users should not run `~/.gradlew jmh` without modifying their gradle parameters quite significantly. It's best to run tests one at a time, as mentioned in the tests themselves.\r\n\r\nThis patch _**does not change the behavior of the jmh test suite**_ with respect to ability to run to completion from its previous state. It's still possible either way, just rather hard given the number of tests and the limitations of Gradle's JVM (even with the common expanded memory parameters).\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/858303362/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/858384924","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2689#issuecomment-858384924","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2689","id":858384924,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg1ODM4NDkyNA==","user":{"login":"jun-he","id":12246263,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjQ2MjYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12246263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jun-he","html_url":"https://github.com/jun-he","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jun-he/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jun-he/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jun-he/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jun-he/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jun-he/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jun-he/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jun-he/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jun-he/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jun-he/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-10T07:29:47Z","updated_at":"2021-06-10T07:29:47Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@TGooch44 Thanks for the comment.

Comment [here](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2591#discussion_r649433302).\r\n- RewriteStrategy\r\n    - Shall we move it to core for now even though it will be public?\r\n    - I am still not sure the current design of `RewriteStrategy` is the best we can come up with. Strategies are Serializable so I assume they can be sent to other nodes in case of distributed planning? However, strategies also define `rewriteFiles` that I think is going to be called on the driver? Plus, right now both the action as well as the strategy interact with the file rewrite coordinator and other things. Ideally, this should be a single entity, in my view.
