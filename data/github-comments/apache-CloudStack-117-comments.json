I think this probably works in all cases, but I suspect it will not clean up correctly always.  Because this was working sometimes and failing sometimes, I believe that means that the cleanup of `account` does not always clean up the snapshots (otherwise it would have never worked).\n\nI think the code should be like this to make sure it cleans up everything up and does not fail.\n\n```\ncls._cleanup = [\n    cls.snapshot_1,\n    cls.snapshot_2,\n    cls.snapshot_3,\n    cls.disk_offering,\n    cls.account,\n    cls.service_offering\n    ]\n```\n\nDoes this make sense to you guys?  This way it will remove the snapshots first and then it will clean up everything else.  I could be wrong, but since the current code ever worked, I think this guarantees that the cleanup of everything will happen and the `account` won't error when it tries to clean up.  I guess if the account keeps a reference to the snapshot after it is deleted, that could cause the account deletion to fail.

We can debug your issue to see if it's caused by NioConnection by changing log4j settings to `TRACE`. Edit `/etc/cloudstack/agent/log4j-cloud.xml`, and add a category with name=\"com.cloud.utils.nio\" and priority value=\"TRACE\" and watch out for issues in the logs. Alternatively, you have enable DEBUG/TRACE on com.cloud and org.apache.cloudstack categories to see what's happening. Finally, if you've an IDE or jdb you can attach a debugger to the agent with JAVA_OPTS settings `-Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=8787,server=y,suspend=n` and connect on remote port 8787 (or any other custom port).
