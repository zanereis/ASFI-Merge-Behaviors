That leads to BoltHeartbeatTimerTask being fired up after 1 second delay before setHeartbeat() assigns initial value to lastHeartbeatTimestamp variable.<br/>\n    As a result when BoltHeartbeatTimeTask fires up for the first time, getLastHeartbeat() returns value of 0. This in turn leads bolt to die with \"subprocess heartbeat timeout\" message.<br/>\n    The fix is to place setHeartBeat() before BoltHeartbeatTimerTask is created. The patch for this is attached.</p>\n\n\n<p>You can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:</p>\n\n<p>    $ git pull <a href=\"https://github.com/slava92/storm\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/slava92/storm</a> master</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1542.patch\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1542.patch</a></p>\n\n<p>To close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch<br/>\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:</p>\n\n<p>    This closes #1542</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>commit d38c40026ab5dac266986896424e6c25a440e512<br/>\nAuthor: Slava Andreyev <sandreyev@ets.org><br/>\nDate:   2016-07-06T17:14:09Z</p>\n\n<p>    initialize lastHeartbeatTimestamp before starting heartbeat task</p>\n\n<hr />","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612923180/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612918997","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/5698#issuecomment-2612918997","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/5698","id":2612918997,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI5MTg5OTc=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-06T18:43:55Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T16:24:23Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=githubbot\">githubbot</a>:</i>\n<p>Github user knusbaum commented on a diff in the pull request:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1507#discussion_r69788000\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1507#discussion_r69788000</a></p>\n\n<p>    &#8212; Diff: storm-core/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/Config.java &#8212;<br/>\n    @@ -1835,6 +1835,21 @@<br/>\n public static final String TOPOLOGY_CLASSPATH=\"topology.classpath\";</p>\n\n<p> /**<br/>\n    +     * Topology-specific classpath for the worker child process.
