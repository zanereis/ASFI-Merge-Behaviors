are a few things going on in this PR… \r\n\r\nFirst it looks like you are attempting to add a lot of test code to clear a bucket region queue, this in turn ends up with an NPE thrown in DiskEntry.\r\n\r\nHowever, Geode does not currently support clearing the bucket region queue and so this PR introduces some “test” product code.  The regression test then calls this “test” code to do the clear.  The NPE is then thrown.  The NPE itself looks like it would be a product issue, however it turns out that the remove you have attempted to call on the bucketRegion is not the correct remove when it comes to a bucketRegionQueue.  What should have been called is destroyKey from the bucket region queue.  Whenever clear is added to the product, it would have to handle this special case.\r\n\r\nThe fix to ignore the null in DiskEntry should not be added at this time.\r\n\r\nI don’t think we should be adding this product code or the related “test” code.  It is hiliting a problem that does not currently exist in Geode.

are Darrel's comments on this PR:\r\nI would change: assigns new entries to buckets based on the entry key contents\r\nto: assigns new entries to buckets based on the entry key's hash code\r\n\r\nI think it is confusing to abbreviate : \"standard custom partitioning\" by dropping \"custom\" from it. So I would say we should include \"custom\"  in both \"standard partitioning\" and \"fixed partitioning\".\r\n\r\nchange: \"Using a custom class.\"\r\nto: \"Using the partition resolver region attribute.\"\r\nThroughout this do not use the term \"custom class\" but instead use \"partition resolver region attribute\".\r\nEven though this is, strictly speaking, a \"partition attribute\", I think it is better to call it a \"region attribute\" since the attributes name is \"partition resolver\".\r\n\r\nchange: \"Specify this class as the partition resolver during region creation.\"\r\nto: \"Implement the PartitionResolver interface with your own class and then specify that class as the partition resolver during region creation.\"\r\n\r\nchange: \"For keys implemented as objects, define the interface within the key’s class.\"\r\nto: \"Have the entry key's class implement the PartitionResolver interface.\"\r\n\r\nchange: \"Using the cache callback class.\"\r\nto: \"Using the callback argument's class.\"\r\n\r\nchange: \"Implement the interface within a cache callback’s class.\"\r\nto: \"Have the class that implements your callback argument implement the PartitionResolver interface.\"\r\nCall it \"callback argument\" in this section not just \"callback\" or \"cache callback\".\r\n\r\nchange: \"Implementing the String-Based Partition Resolver\"\r\nto \"Using the String Prefix Partition Resolver\"\r\nIn general replace \"String-Based\" with \"String Prefix\".\r\nAdd to that section \"This class can be used as the partition resolver region attribute.\" and/or refer them to the section on configuring it.\r\n\r\nIn the section titled \"Configuring Standard Partitioning\" change the title to \"Configuring the Partition Resolver Region Attribute\"\r\nand change the section to focus on this instead of \"custom partitioning\". For example I think you can just drop this sentence:\r\n\"How you do this depends on where you chose to implement your custom partitioning.\"\r\nWhat it depends on is how you are configuring the product. You should start with gfsh, then java, and then xml. This ordering should be used throughout all the examples. We want to push gfsh.\r\n\r\nDelete these items from the configuration section:\r\nEntry key. Use the key object with the resolver implementation for every entry operation.\r\nCache callback argument. Provide the argument to every call that accesses an entry. This restricts you to calls that take a callback argument.\r\n\r\nDelete this line: Define the class for the region at creation. The resolver will be used for every entry operation.

Before the threads are started on all the senders / dispatchers it sets the isStopped flag for the SerialGatewaySenderEventProcessor to true.\r\n5. Then the _dispatchBatch method which was in retry mode makes a getConnection call to get the connection. This method does a check on the SerialGatewaySenderEventProcessor's isStopped flag. It sees that the flag is set and this returns null.\r\n6. This null is stored in the global variable connection for the dispatcher.\r\n7. Now that the _dispatchBatch method call sees that the connection is null it should raise an exception and destroyConnection.\r\n8. Meanwhile there was a AckThreadReader that was running and the stopper thread for the event processor wants to stop it, but since the connection global variable was set to null by the get connection method call by _disptachBatch.\r\n9. Hence the shutDownAckReaderThreadConnection is executed on null and hence the AckReaderThread continues to keep running - being stuck on socketRead0.\r\n10. But the problem is that the AckReaderThread acquired a connectionLifeCycle.readLock. to readAcknowledgement, but the destroyConnection calls from the stopper thread and _dispatchBatch's exception handling code needs a connectionLifeCycleLock.writeLock which they can't because readLock is held by the AckReaderThread, causing a deadlock\r\n  ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/352892881/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/353111904","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/1175#issuecomment-353111904","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/1175","id":353111904,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MzExMTkwNA==","user":{"login":"pdxrunner","id":16668768,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjY4NzY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16668768?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxrunner","html_url":"https://github.com/pdxrunner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxrunner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxrunner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxrunner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxrunner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxrunner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxrunner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxrunner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxrunner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxrunner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-20T16:29:49Z","updated_at":"2017-12-20T16:29:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"+1 to renaming LocatorServerStartupRule to ClusterStartupRule.
