some more debugging, it appears to me the problem was in my client code, and not in jquery.couch.js.  The problem was that the second argument to bulkSave(docs, options) is required, and I was omitting it, thinking it was optional.  When I supply an empty options object like this: {}, the error goes away.\n\nThe reason options is required is that when options is undefined, it is not an object, so cannot be extended within the definition of the ajax() method around line 992, and remains undefined instead.  As a result, by the time the \"complete\" section of the ajax() method runs, options.successStatus == 200, making the following condition fail:  if (req.status == options.successStatus).\n\nBeyond that, of course it's wise to provide an error handler after calling bulkSave(), so it's unlikely most users will want to omit the options object, and fine for it to remain a required argument.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/29871910/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/29893462","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/116#issuecomment-29893462","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/116","id":29893462,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5ODkzNDYy","user":{"login":"rnewson","id":47223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson","html_url":"https://github.com/rnewson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-12-05T12:26:09Z","updated_at":"2013-12-05T12:26:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks!

Providing such metric from CouchDB is useless since if I cares about my disks space, I'd like to monitor all of them, not just those that CouchDB uses. Moreover, there is another place that left out of scope, but also important: logs .\n\n> To enable triggering compaction using an external source based on disk usage.\n\nCouchDB since 1.2 release supports automatically compaction with very rich configuration options. Just [take a look on them](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/config/compaction.html#compaction-daemon-rules). If compaction isn't possible due to low disk space, CouchDB will emit special log message at `warning` level which could be easily handled. However, if you have any monitoring tool installed on server, probably you'd already created special metric that alerts you about such situations.\n\n> To make it make it easier for automatic replication/sharding orchestration mechanisms to make good decisions on how to balance/move data.\n\nOn this point I think Robert know the answer.\n\nAlso, on Windows you cannot get drive free space correctly without special tools. For instance, DFS is one of such cases.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/31291925/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/31306714","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/124#issuecomment-31306714","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/124","id":31306714,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMzA2NzE0","user":{"login":"JensRantil","id":730342,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMDM0Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/730342?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JensRantil","html_url":"https://github.com/JensRantil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JensRantil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JensRantil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JensRantil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JensRantil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JensRantil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JensRantil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JensRantil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JensRantil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JensRantil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-12-28T22:52:59Z","updated_at":"2013-12-28T22:52:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rnewson and @kxepal Great points all of them - thanks.

@BigBlueHat, this is a great idea. Unfortunately it doesn't seem to work. It seems to completely remove all template data. I ran `grunt couchdb` which builds Fauxton and deploys to `/share/www/fauxton`. I then go to /_utils/fauxton/ and no templates are rendered. I also checked `dist/debug/templates` but the templates have been borked. \n\nLet me know if I can help. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/31816399/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/31840318","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/126#issuecomment-31840318","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/126","id":31840318,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxODQwMzE4","user":{"login":"BigBlueHat","id":43209,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43209?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigBlueHat","html_url":"https://github.com/BigBlueHat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigBlueHat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigBlueHat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigBlueHat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigBlueHat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigBlueHat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigBlueHat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigBlueHat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigBlueHat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigBlueHat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-01-08T15:05:50Z","updated_at":"2014-01-08T15:05:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@garrensmith seems I'd left out a return... :-P\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/31840318/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/31844209","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/126#issuecomment-31844209","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/126","id":31844209,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxODQ0MjA5","user":{"login":"garrensmith","id":179458,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTQ1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/179458?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith","html_url":"https://github.com/garrensmith","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-01-08T15:30:32Z","updated_at":"2014-01-08T15:30:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Great.
