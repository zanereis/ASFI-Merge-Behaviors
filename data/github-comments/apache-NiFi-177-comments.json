I think we need to be careful here. This is updating the API, but I'm not sure this is the right abstraction.\r\nThe `resolveIrrelevantProperties` is a bit of a leaky abstraction. It's not clear when and where this should be called. The lifecycle doesn't really fit. Additionally, I don't think the `containsCyclicDependencies` is really necessary here, at least in this context.\r\nThe framework already has the logic to avoid performing validation against properties that are not used (see https://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/main/nifi-api/src/main/java/org/apache/nifi/components/AbstractConfigurableComponent.java#L99-L102).\r\n\r\nThe problem here is a bug in the ListenSyslog Processor. It is specifically checking this:\r\n```\r\n        final String protocol = validationContext.getProperty(PROTOCOL).getValue();\r\n        final SSLContextService sslContextService = validationContext.getProperty(SSL_CONTEXT_SERVICE).asControllerService(SSLContextService.class);\r\n\r\n        if (UDP_VALUE.getValue().equals(protocol) && sslContextService != null) {\r\n            results.add(new ValidationResult.Builder()\r\n                    .explanation(\"SSL can not be used with UDP\")\r\n                    .valid(false).subject(\"SSL Context\").build());\r\n        }\r\n```\r\nThis made sense when it was written, as there was no ability to make one property depend on another. However, later the SSLContext Service property became dependent on the protocol property. When this happened, this whole block of code should have been removed.\r\n\r\nI do think it's reasonable to update the code such that calling `getProperty(...)` will return a `PropertyValue` with a `null` value if the dependency is not satisfied. However, I think we can do this more simply by making use of the `isDependencySatisfied` method as illustrated  above in AbstractConfigurableComponent. I also think it should be addressed as a separate Jira, as this Jira is really pointing out a bug that is specific to ListenSyslog.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1251568321/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1251665176","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6364#issuecomment-1251665176","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6364","id":1251665176,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5KmuUY","user":{"login":"chnorton","id":1308501,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDg1MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1308501?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chnorton","html_url":"https://github.com/chnorton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chnorton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chnorton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chnorton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chnorton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chnorton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chnorton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chnorton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chnorton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chnorton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-19T23:16:41Z","updated_at":"2022-09-19T23:16:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@mattyb149 Any chance this could be looked at again?

I added a blurb to the LICENSE file. Brotli is meant to be drop-in for gzip (it's effectively a smarter gzip) but I discovered after the fact it actually has compression levels that go all the way to 11. For now it's limited to the original 9 due to the way that parameter is implemented in CompressContent.java. Better to have format support in and get perfection later IMO. Brotli level 9 made fools out of every other compression format in the unit test files, I'm not sure 10 or 11 would be worth it due to the added latency when streaming.\r\nI also made the executive decision to call its MIME type application/x-brotli. It doesn't have an official one as far as I can tell, with the excuse it's meant for streaming not file data. This has been used by others to denote brotli compressed files as well, and as far as I know seems standards compliant.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1251903179/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1252295712","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6388#issuecomment-1252295712","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6388","id":1252295712,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5KpIQg","user":{"login":"mcgilman","id":123395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzM5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman","html_url":"https://github.com/mcgilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-20T12:39:26Z","updated_at":"2022-09-20T12:39:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Will review...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1252295712/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1252636917","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6433#issuecomment-1252636917","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6433","id":1252636917,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5Kqbj1","user":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-20T16:55:17Z","updated_at":"2022-09-20T16:55:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for putting up the Draft PR @simonbence\r\nThis is definitely a HUGE PR.

Perhaps the rename itself that should have been pushed up as a separate PR, but not a big deal.\r\nPutting up the Draft PR, though, is really helpful, I think, because it will allow us to move much more quickly when all is finished up because we've had a good chance to review the approach\r\n\r\nOverall, I think you're very much on the right track, too!

I missed the use of `JsonTreeRowRecordReader` when making this change, and since I could only verify selecting a reader and oauth service and not actually run the processor, I suspect this change will cause a CNF exception at runtime.\r\n\r\nIdeally I think we should strive for NAR dependencies to be used primarily for API NARs. Meaning for a processor to depend on a service API that it needs, or for implementing a service API, but not really for accessing implementation code in another NAR. Usually this can be achieved by factoring out some common code to a shared JAR that can be used in multiple NARs, but I'm not sure that works easily in this case.\r\n\r\nA similar situation exists with `nifi-snowflake-nar` having a dependency on `nifi-dbcp-service-nar`, instead of depending on just the DBCP API from `nifi-standard-services-api-nar`. This was because `SnowflakeComputingConnectionPool extends DBCPConnectionPool` but I think it would be preferable to factor out some kind of shared `AbstractConnectionPool` that they both extend from.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1252863814/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1252931281","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6437#issuecomment-1252931281","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6437","id":1252931281,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5KrjbR","user":{"login":"mcgilman","id":123395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzM5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman","html_url":"https://github.com/mcgilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-20T21:25:59Z","updated_at":"2022-09-20T21:25:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Will review...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1252931281/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1253251075","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6319#issuecomment-1253251075","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6319","id":1253251075,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5KsxgD","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-21T06:12:45Z","updated_at":"2022-09-21T06:12:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the feedback and testing @turcsanyip!\r\n\r\nI pushed an update incorporating your suggestions for credential handling in `PutAzureEventHub` and also addressed issues with Event Position handling.\r\n\r\nFor `GetAzureEventHub`, the initial enqueued time determination happens once as suggested, and subsequent executions use the `PartitionProperties` to determine the last enqueued time. This approach should be more robust for handling gaps between processor execution.\r\n\r\nFor `ConsumeAzureEventHub`, the new  `LegacyBlobStorageEventPositionProvider` is responsible for locating existing checkpoint information and returning it when found. The implementation follows the storage approach used in [AzureStorageCheckpointLeaseManager](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/main/sdk/eventhubs/microsoft-azure-eventhubs-eph/src/main/java/com/microsoft/azure/eventprocessorhost/AzureStorageCheckpointLeaseManager.java) from the legacy SDK. The implementation will read existing sequence numbers as use them to derive a starting Event Position when found. The provider also deletes the blob since the consumer will subsequently store checkpoint information using the new SDK strategy. This approach should handle the basic migration scenario when upgrading NiFi to a version that includes these changes. It is probably worth including a note in the NiFi migration guidance for awareness.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you notice any additional issues.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1253251075/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1253403132","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6433#issuecomment-1253403132","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6433","id":1253403132,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5KtWn8","user":{"login":"simonbence","id":61191107,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMTkxMTA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61191107?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbence","html_url":"https://github.com/simonbence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbence/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-21T08:53:09Z","updated_at":"2022-09-21T08:53:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> \r\n\r\nThank you very much, and thank you for the quick feedback!

code.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1254588054/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1254603682","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6313#issuecomment-1254603682","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6313","id":1254603682,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5Kx7ui","user":{"login":"thenatog","id":38888042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg4MDQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38888042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog","html_url":"https://github.com/thenatog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-22T06:51:36Z","updated_at":"2022-09-22T06:51:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I

In this PR, you make the VersionedFlowCoordinates now deprecate the Registry URL. This makes sense, since the URL is not a first-class citizen of the extension point. But it now uses the Registry ID in order to identify a flow. So if there is an inner Process Group that is versioned, and an outer Process Group that is versioned, the inner group is identified by this Registry ID.\r\n\r\nThe problem, though, is that the Registry ID is specific to that nifi instance/cluster.\r\nIf I then go to a different nifi cluster and create a Registry Client that points to the same registry, the Registry ID will not match, so that will create an issue.\r\n\r\nMy recommendation would be: Instead of VersionedFlowCoordinates having a Registry ID, it would contain a 'Storage Location'. And that Storage Location would be a String. For the existing implementation that would be just the URL. And then, we'd update the FlowRegistryClient to have a new method: `boolean IsStorageLocationApplicable(String location)` or something of that nature. In this way, we can loop over all registry clients and find the one that allows for the storage location and use it to fetch the flow. In the case that there are multiple clients that indicate that the location is applicable, we can go through all clients. If it's able to find the flow, great. If not, go to the next one.\r\n\r\nDoes that make sense & sound reasonable?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1255289595/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1255455611","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6442#issuecomment-1255455611","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6442","id":1255455611,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5K1Lt7","user":{"login":"thenatog","id":38888042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg4MDQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38888042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog","html_url":"https://github.com/thenatog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-22T19:24:58Z","updated_at":"2022-09-22T19:24:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Will review..","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1255455611/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1255512994","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6442#issuecomment-1255512994","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6442","id":1255512994,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5K1Zui","user":{"login":"thenatog","id":38888042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg4MDQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38888042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog","html_url":"https://github.com/thenatog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-22T20:25:45Z","updated_at":"2022-09-22T20:25:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 will merge","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1255512994/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1255764005","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6313#issuecomment-1255764005","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6313","id":1255764005,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5K2XAl","user":{"login":"thenatog","id":38888042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg4MDQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38888042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog","html_url":"https://github.com/thenatog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-23T03:28:42Z","updated_at":"2022-09-23T03:28:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Just a note, if you have changes made as a result of a review, commit the change as an additional commit and don't force push.

I changed the module code and re-ran a flowfile (without stopping the processor.) The changes were not reflected in the processed flowfile.
