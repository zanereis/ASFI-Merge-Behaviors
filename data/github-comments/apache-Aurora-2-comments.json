https://github.com/apache/aurora/blob/master/src/test/sh/org/apache/aurora/e2e/test_end_to_end.sh#L689 which has 8 parameters 😮 This won't change if written in another language but bash syntax is hard to parse in my opinion.\r\n\r\nI do think you bring up a good point that a good portion of the script deals with operational stuff.\r\n\r\nMaybe we can abstract away the operational stuff to smaller, more pointed bash scripts (i.e. restart and verify that the scheduler came back up), and leave the more intricate stuff (i.e. verifying that a payload is correct) to a python script running the

need help making this more idiomatic once it's ready for review.\r\n* Return statements will be changed to raise errors with the correct errors instead once I'm done.\r\n\r\nIt's not an elegant

For some reason while using an update to flex up on an aurora job using the an update, one out of three of the instances flexed up fails the health check.\r\n\r\nThis is particularly strange because I'm able to navigate to the observer with the web ui, hit the health check port, and it replies with the message OK.\r\n\r\nOddly enough, I just tried it a third time and it succeeded :sweat: so it looks like we have a flaky test on our hands.
