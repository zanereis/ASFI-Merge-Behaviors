turns out that the issue in the `context_test.go` test was in `FunctionContext.GetInputTopics()`. \r\nThe instance method gets its valued populated by `goInstance.setupConsumer()`, which must not have been getting run in the test. I changed the getter on the functionContext to get the inputTopic values directly from `functionContext.instanceConf.funcDetails.GetSource().InputSpecs`. \r\nWe may want to remove dependencies on the functionContext.inputTopics field (and remove the field altogether) to prevent confusion later on. \r\nAlso, the conf.yaml values must have been changed, so I updated the test to match the values that were being provided. \r\nIt's passing locally for me. \r\n\r\nI also added a new test file `instanceControlServicer_test.go` that tests that a gRPC server can be created and successfully connected to. \r\n\r\nWe probably still need to test the entire thing end-to-end to ensure that concurrency issues weren't introduced anywhere and that I'm starting the servicer in the correct location.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/573905253/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/573939280","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/6026#issuecomment-573939280","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/6026","id":573939280,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MzkzOTI4MA==","user":{"login":"tuteng","id":1907867,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDc4Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1907867?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuteng","html_url":"https://github.com/tuteng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuteng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuteng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuteng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuteng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuteng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuteng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuteng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuteng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuteng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-14T00:25:00Z","updated_at":"2020-01-14T00:25:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"run
