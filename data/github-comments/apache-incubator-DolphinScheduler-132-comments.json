Of course, I will continue to migrate my flows in Azkaban to DS:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/reele/process_definition_import_tool\r\n\r\n**Therefore, is it necessary to add a common template import interface in DS, so that the data of other scheduling platforms can be formatted and exported, and then directly imported into DS?

the question**\r\nThere are discrepancies between holidays in some industries and national holidays, such as finance. With the scheduling options provided by the current DS, it is necessary to determine whether it is a working day in each task node before performing related operations. Whether to consider adding a customizable calendar configuration, specify it during task configuration.\r\n\r\n**What are the current deficiencies and the benefits of improvement**\r\nA set of natural day calendar is provided by default, compatible with current tasks. If a custom calendar is configured, the schedule will be performed according to the custom calendar. Avoid making relevant judgments in all task nodes.\r\n\r\n**Which version of DolphinScheduler:**\r\n -[1.3.6]\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nA clear and concise description of any alternative improvement solutions you've considered.\r\n\r\n**问题描述**：\r\n有一些行业的节假日与国定节假日存在出入，例如金融。以当前DS提供的调度选项，需要在每个任务节点中去判断是否为工作日再执行相关操作。 是否考虑增加可自定义的日历配置，在任务配置时指定。\r\n\r\n**改进建议**：\r\n默认提供一套自然日日历，兼容当前已有任务。如果配置自定义日历，则按自定义的日历来进行调度。避免在所有任务节点中进行相关判断。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/890533448/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/890533468","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/5932#issuecomment-890533468","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/5932","id":890533468,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms41FHZc","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-01T14:49:50Z","updated_at":"2021-08-01T14:49:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi:\n*

**About migrating to DolphinScheduler**\r\n> \r\n> It is believed that many users are attracted by the functions of DS, but not everyone can easily migrate the original scheduling configuration to DS, especially the scheduling platform with thousands of jobs such as data warehouse.\r\n> \r\n> Most users really need a tool for easy data migration, and I am one of them, and I need to migrate more than 6000 jobs.\r\n> \r\n> So after reading most of the code, I wrote a simple script, which can directly generate the job information of batch configuration into the database. Of course, I will continue to migrate my flows in Azkaban to DS:\r\n> \r\n> * https://github.com/reele/process_definition_import_tool\r\n> \r\n> **Therefore, is it necessary to add a common template import interface in DS, so that the data of other scheduling platforms can be formatted and exported, and then directly imported into DS? Or implement a common stand-alone tool for data conversion?**\r\n> \r\n> ## **Which version of DolphinScheduler:**\r\n> -[1.3.6-release]\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, this function is generally implemented by users themselves. There are too many scheduling platforms (including self-development), complex structures and more uncertainties, which makes it difficult to parse and initialize into DS general format (especially on front-end, how to initialize location to define the coordinates of each task?), we can collect the user's own scripts, summarize them to the tool set on the DS official website, and download and modify them by ourselves.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/891684920/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/891753604","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/5943#issuecomment-891753604","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/5943","id":891753604,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms41JxSE","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-03T11:04:53Z","updated_at":"2021-08-03T11:04:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi:\n*

In my opinion, this function is generally implemented by users themselves. There are too many scheduling platforms (including self-development), complex structures and more uncertainties, which makes it difficult to parse and initialize into DS general format (especially on front-end, how to initialize location to define the coordinates of each task?), we can collect the user's own scripts, summarize them to the tool set on the DS official website, and download and modify them by ourselves.\r\n\r\nIn my understanding, the main reasons for migration difficulties are as follows:\r\n1. Job data structure is complex and difficult to be solved by simple mapping\r\n2. Difficult for non-developer user\r\n\r\nTypically, the migration of large numbers of jobs (thousands) is done with little regard for the DAG graphics, and the dependencies are likely to be too complex for the data warehouse user to develop with the DAG graphical interface, like mine(One of the simpler):\r\n\r\n![auto_generated_dag](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38578667/128014335-ff35b5c0-424b-4d72-912b-efa688ee68ba.png)\r\n\r\nIn general, the scheduler requires the following basic data:\r\n1.Task definition\r\n2.Task Dependencies\r\n3.Scheduling of tasks\r\n4.DAG drawing definition\r\n5.Task group definition\r\n\r\nI think, 1-3 are required and 4,5 are optional.\r\n\r\nIf the common interface of 1-3 can be implemented, the data migration will be very friendly to other platforms.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/891811825/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/891842056","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/5875#issuecomment-891842056","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/5875","id":891842056,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms41KG4I","user":{"login":"brave-lee","id":42576980,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNTc2OTgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42576980?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brave-lee","html_url":"https://github.com/brave-lee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brave-lee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brave-lee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brave-lee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brave-lee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brave-lee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brave-lee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brave-lee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brave-lee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brave-lee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-03T13:21:33Z","updated_at":"2021-08-03T13:26:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"When the master module generates a DAG, it will use the name of the task as the key of the nodeMap (See MasterExecThread|buildFlowDag).
