It is not as \"push button\" simple as your contribution here, but it is \"good enough\" considering the resources we have in the community today.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, \"push button\" style setup is what most people want nowadays want to quickly set up a test environment and start playing around. I do understand that supporting different installation methods (including mine :p) adds a burden, but I think it is a burden we have to bear until Metron grows bigger.\r\n\r\n> We should also consider that running Metron on a single node is a recipe for a horrible user experience. It should only be run on a single node for development purposes, which is something that we already do support. I would not recommend that anyone run Metron on a single node for any other purpose.\r\n\r\nThat's why AWS has a bunch of different VM types :) Maybe we should add a big fat warning somewhere saying \"Your experience will be very bad if you not use at least an m5.4xlarge instance if you're going the single node way.\"\r\n\r\nI think having quick & easy ways to setup Metron on a single node to play around is necessary until the Metron community grows...\r\n\r\nAnyway, back to lurking mode for now.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/378818473/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/378897353","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/916#issuecomment-378897353","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/916","id":378897353,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3ODg5NzM1Mw==","user":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-05T10:55:35Z","updated_at":"2018-04-05T10:55:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@lvets Putting the vagrant file into a /contrib area with a notice that sets expectation correctly is the way to go then","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/378897353/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/378966791","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/946#issuecomment-378966791","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/946","id":378966791,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3ODk2Njc5MQ==","user":{"login":"mmiklavc","id":658443,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODQ0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/658443?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc","html_url":"https://github.com/mmiklavc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-05T15:00:21Z","updated_at":"2018-04-05T15:00:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the updates @wardbekker.

I think fundamentally there are a few issues causing problems.\r\n\r\n1. The extensive inheritance amongst all of these interfaces is problematic.  This introduces hard dependencies and is difficult to make sense of.  This picture does not look clean to me; IMHO.\r\n\r\n    <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2475409/38499370-537d4f12-3bd5-11e8-8e1b-8171630e8adf.jpeg\" width=200>\r\n\r\n    * For example, why is an `UpdateDao` also a `RetrieveLatestDao`?  These need to be completely separate.  There should be no inheritance between the two.  \r\n\r\n        There should be a separate... \r\n           * `SolrUpdateDao -> UpdateDao` and a \r\n           * `SolrRetrieveLatestDao -> RetrieveLatestDao`.  \r\n\r\n        If someone needs to do updates, they should use the `UpdateDao`.  If someone needs to get the latest documents, they should the `RetrieveLatestDao`.  \r\n\r\n1. I believe all of this inheritance, along with all of the default methods, exist because we are using inheritance for code reuse, instead of composition.  This prevents it from being more modular, simple, and testable.  \r\n\r\n    * For example, the `SolrMetaAlertDao` should **use** a `RetrieveLatestDao`, it should **not be** a `RetrieveLatestDao`.\r\n\r\n   * Another example, if the `SolrUpdateDao` needs to also search, then it should be passed an instance of a `SearchDao` to do that.  It does not itself need to be a `SearchDao`. \r\n\r\n1. There are also unnecessary interfaces that cause confusion.\r\n\r\n    * For example, there are compositional uses of the interface `IndexDAO`.  But what is an `IndexDAO`?  Based on the inheritance hierarchy an `IndexDAO` is an `UpdateDao`, a `SearchDao`, a `RetrieveLatestDao` all at the same time.  \r\n\r\n       If something needs to do updates, then pass in an `UpdateDao`.  If something needs to search, then pass in a `SearchDao`.  If something needs to do BOTH, then pass in both a `SearchDao` and an `UpdateDao`.  \r\n\r\n      The only real method in `IndexDao` seems exactly the same as a `ColumnMetadataDao`.  So if something needs that functionality, it should be given a `ColumnMetadataDao` not an `IndexDao`. \r\n The `IndexDao` should either be given some real purpose or die a quick and painless death\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/379747903/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/379753440","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/970#issuecomment-379753440","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/970","id":379753440,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3OTc1MzQ0MA==","user":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-09T13:33:57Z","updated_at":"2018-04-09T13:33:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"So, @nickwallen , do you propose implementation of Decorator or another such pattern?

I did a super POC refactoring I think is closer to what you're looking for.  It only restructures the code more the way you're talking about (for Solr only, didn't have time to push everything to ES also), and doesn't resolve the code reuse problem. Check out https://github.com/justinleet/metron/tree/METRON-1421-interface-refactor\r\n\r\nRight now the way that's set up is that it pushes the implementations down to a class level and composes them directly, which is a push closer to the way the base SolrDao does things.\r\n\r\nIt does not get rid of IndexDao.  I think that's valuable to keep as a unified, single-entry point interface.  The main implementations (SolrDao and SolrMetaAlertDao) defer primarily to the interface.  I'm inclined to not break that for this PR (the current master does this exact thing, but duplicates the methods in IndexDao and the related DAOs, which I think is worse than just having IndexDao extend explicitly).  We could have those vary independently, but I'm inclined to consider that outside the scope of this PR.  MetaAlertDao is similarly structured by extending the MetaAlert* interfaces + IndexDao, ensuring that SolrMetaAlertDao meets all the requirements for the DAOs.\r\n\r\nTo make that branch viable, in my mind we need a couple things\r\n1. Mirror the changes in the ES side\r\n2. Solve the code reuse problem for Solr and ES.\r\n3. Clean up tests for both\r\n4. Probably other cleanup I'm not thinking of right now.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/379951486/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/380091958","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/970#issuecomment-380091958","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/970","id":380091958,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MDA5MTk1OA==","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-10T13:09:03Z","updated_at":"2018-04-10T13:09:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It is definitely looking better.

Prior to some of the Solr refactorings, it existed as a single DAO to provide a complete set of functionality to be implemented in order to allow an implementation to be complete (for some definition of complete) and available to be swapped out via configuration.  Even with the refactoring into multiple interfaces, the IndexDao and MetaAlertDao still exist to provide some definition of complete.\r\n\r\nGetting rid of IndexDao in particular likely has potentially broader implications because right now that interface ties together the various layers. Making those changes in a complete and consistent manner is larger than MetaAlertService, because the SearchServiceImpl and others take an IndexDao (which could be a regular SolrDao or SolrMetaAlertDao, etc.) in order to allow regular searches to have meta alert adjustments, e.g. massage the queries to make sure metaalerts get searched and returned.\r\n\r\nAnother problem is there's refactoring to existing infrastructure and patterns around the creation and composition of IndexDaos. In addition, configuration changes will need to be made (and thought out) without that interface existing.  I'm not sure how large that refactoring is, but I think changing and testing that is nontrivial enough that it should be a separate PR.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I'm worried about increasing the scope of an already large and complicated PR and I'm disinclined to pull that task into this PR without compelling reasons. If removing those interfaces is a necessity for moving forward here, I'd like to see that as a PR against the parent feature branch that we pull into this branch when it's done. I'm happy to help out using this branch (or a derivative thereof) as a pilot / testing ground for that, but again I think removing the basic DAO interface itself is outside the scope of this.\r\n\r\nI'd like to know what specific problems we're going to solve that merit that level of change in this PR. IMO, those problems would need to be pretty compelling (e.g. we find that reducing the duplication between ES and Solr necessitates it) to increase the scope that way unless the changes end up being substantially easier and less impactful than I'd expect.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/380113220/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/380115328","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/754#issuecomment-380115328","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/754","id":380115328,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MDExNTMyOA==","user":{"login":"lvets","id":4215920,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTU5MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4215920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvets","html_url":"https://github.com/lvets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-10T14:16:18Z","updated_at":"2018-04-10T14:16:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@ottobackwards I will try this out this week.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/380115328/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/380119243","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/970#issuecomment-380119243","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/970","id":380119243,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MDExOTI0Mw==","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-10T14:25:56Z","updated_at":"2018-04-10T14:25:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I'd like to know what specific problems we're going to solve that merit that level of change in this PR. \r\n\r\nThe fundamental problem here is a lack of good unit tests on these search DAOs.

A lot of the highly specific changes at the implementation level of MetaAlertDao are things that more or less need to be integration tested (e.g. making sure the magic Solr incantations do what's expected).  The other stuff can be unit tested regardless of what implementation class it's in.\r\n\r\nRe: #832 Absolutely agree we should have as many unit tests as possible to avoid things like this.\r\n\r\nThe tests are substantially better than they were prior to this PR. I'm happy to take another pass to try to catch out any cases we're missing.  The initial pass took place during a refactoring and I wouldn't be surprised if there's more we can do.  The problem is that I need to have a stable code base that I'm testing against. That's the main reason I'm trying to get this narrowed down and resolve the overall code structure.  I'm not trying to say that we're done adding tests or that there's not room for improvement.  I'm trying to get to a point where I'm not trying to build the tests we'd both like to see on a pile of sand.  For me, killing that dedupe is a prerequisite because it could change how those unit tests happen in terms of avoiding duplication and ensuring that the variants on the implementations are more easily understood and tested.  Right now it's hard to build expectations against the code, because we're changing basic structure and how things are built.  Even if the test cases themselves cover the same thing, a lot of stuff like setup changes so there's nontrivial effort involved in keeping the tests aligned.\r\n\r\nIMO (and feel free, or even encouraged, to argue with me on this), killing the interfaces doesn't buy us enough testability to merit adding that refactoring to this PR.  I do think rethinking the DAO structure is a definitely a worthwhile task that could improve a lot of things at once, but it should be a separate effort.\r\n\r\nI think a reasonable level of testing for this PR is the integration testing at the level of broad interface DAOs + the already substantial increase in testing + maybe another pass once the implementation has stabilized. Let me know if your expectations are different, because it sounds like both of our expectations are influencing how much refactoring we want, so we need to be on the same page there.\r\n\r\nRe: the issue on this PR itself, that appears to be an issue with using the correct source.type field for Solr. I'm working on a confirming and providing a separate fix for that.  Part of the problem appears to be the unit tests themselves are incorrect. The other problem is that our test schemas incorrectly use ':' instead of '.' and I carried this through. So the problem isn't that the tests are incomplete, but that it's compounding a bug in our tests themselves.  In fact, I called out that I thought it was weird we were using ':' in the PR description.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/380137966/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/380147279","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/684#issuecomment-380147279","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/684","id":380147279,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MDE0NzI3OQ==","user":{"login":"merrimanr","id":311928,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTkyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/311928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr","html_url":"https://github.com/merrimanr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-10T15:40:28Z","updated_at":"2018-04-10T15:40:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sorry for ignoring this for so long.

It's important to have that perspective, and I am 100% appreciative of you hopping in and offering up your opinion.  I think you're right that we probably need to reach a solid compromise position rather than boiling the ocean.\r\n\r\n@nickwallen What if, for this PR, we do the following:\r\n1. Mostly keep the interface refactoring from the branch.\r\n2. Instead of pushing everything directly into SolrUpdateMetaAlertDao and ElasticsearchUpdateMetaAlertDao, we push to AbstractLuceneUpdateMetaAlertDao minimally as needed to prevent duping (which is admittedly substantial)?  Everything else pushes down to the specific DAO which extends the abstract DAOs. As in the test branch, the SolrMetaAlertDao just uses and passes along the appropriate impls as needed.\r\n3. Repeat (2) for the other DAOs implementations\r\n4. I take another pass at tests to make sure both the common and specific impls are properly tested.\r\n\r\nAt that point, it should somewhat clean up the type hierarchy which will enable us to make things more pluggable in the future (including potentially working to eliminate the aggregate marker interfaces). At the very least, I think it makes it more straightforward, although it's not perfect. This should improve maintainability and testing. The testing pass should make sure we're at least better positioned to be confident in future refactorings.\r\n\r\nI 100% admit this doesn't completely address the composition vs. extension, but it at least makes progress relative towards that goal relative to where we were.  It has the benefit of being a doable fairly low-risk refactoring that enables the PR to make it into the branch.\r\n\r\nHopefully this has the elements of a good compromise: Nobody is overjoyed, but nobody feels cheated.  In addition, we at least have set ourselves up to make it easier for everyone to be happier in the future.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/380181819/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/380184681","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/970#issuecomment-380184681","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/970","id":380184681,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MDE4NDY4MQ==","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-10T17:34:09Z","updated_at":"2018-04-10T17:34:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I agree with your plan @justinleet .

That being said, I have some comments after having more or less caught up with the thread.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, it's not uncommon to provide an interface that encompasses all the desired methods for your data access layer. For instance:\r\n- https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/tableDataGateway.html\r\n- https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/dataMapper.html\r\n- https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/data_access_object_pattern.htm\r\n\r\nI initially blinked at having the broad assortment of individual (CRUD) interfaces along with the aggregate ones, but I think that's fine. Not strictly necessary, but at least the intention is clear.\r\n\r\nI think some of the trouble I/we're seeing with these interfaces and the inheritance is that it seems like there's some code smell around the abstractions we're using  wrt the meta alerts and index. \"Index\" and \"meta alert\" don't seem to be on the same plane of abstraction. Index is a data store whereas meta alert is a domain model object. I think it's probably time (as a follow on DISCUSS thread) to map out how we want our access patterns restructured to better accommodate the request for composition that @nickwallen pointed out along with addressing the model and DAO abstraction mismatch.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/380220397/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/380224065","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/970#issuecomment-380224065","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/970","id":380224065,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MDIyNDA2NQ==","user":{"login":"justinleet","id":5077341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzczNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5077341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet","html_url":"https://github.com/justinleet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-10T19:45:45Z","updated_at":"2018-04-10T19:45:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mmiklavc I think that's a good insight.

PR provides an expression cache for stellar when using the stellar field transformations in parsers.  Specifically, we found that without caching we were substantially stymied when performance tuning enrichments.  Thus, other places where stellar is in the critical path might derive benefit from similar caching in Enrichments.\r\nA couple of points about the implementation:\r\n* We use the same underlying caching strategy as in enrichments (caffeine-based least frequently used cache).\r\n* This caching is implemented in stellar core as an alternative to the StellarProcessor.  This way it is reusable elsewhere that stellar is used eventually.\r\n* This caching is slightly different than the caching in enrichments in that:\r\n  * Enrichment caching is done regardless of adapter (stellar enrichments uses the same cache as the hbase enrichments)\r\n  * Enrichment caching for stellar is at the group level (e.g. the key is the group of stellar expressions and the input variables used in the group adn the value is the set of results for that group given the input).  This implementation is at the individual expression level.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/380585598/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/380586646","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/990#issuecomment-380586646","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/990","id":380586646,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MDU4NjY0Ng==","user":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-11T20:33:35Z","updated_at":"2018-04-11T20:33:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Does this assume, that if you have multiple transformations that all of them should be cached?\r\nDoes it assume that every stellar function returns the same value with the same input?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/380586646/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/380586872","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/967#issuecomment-380586872","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/967","id":380586872,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MDU4Njg3Mg==","user":{"login":"mmiklavc","id":658443,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODQ0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/658443?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc","html_url":"https://github.com/mmiklavc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-11T20:34:24Z","updated_at":"2018-04-11T20:34:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Still looks fine -
