It's a great start, but we probably need to modify it to be more Gobblin-like in design (for example using safer `ThreadPool`s, using scheduled thread instead of `Thread.sleep`, etc.). The functionality will end up being very similar, so any tests for this will likely be useful for the refactoring as well.\nMaybe a nice starting point is for you to document the current architecture of the monitor (couple paragraphs, maybe a nice diagram), so we can think from there how to refactor it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/228388210/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/228419675","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/1067#issuecomment-228419675","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/1067","id":228419675,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyODQxOTY3NQ==","user":{"login":"abti","id":69499,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69499?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abti","html_url":"https://github.com/abti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abti/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-24T18:13:33Z","updated_at":"2016-06-24T18:13:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"LGTM\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/228419675/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/228419879","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/1068#issuecomment-228419879","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/1068","id":228419879,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyODQxOTg3OQ==","user":{"login":"abti","id":69499,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69499?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abti","html_url":"https://github.com/abti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abti/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-24T18:14:29Z","updated_at":"2016-06-24T18:14:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@ydai1124 Can you also please review?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/228419879/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/228431866","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/1068#issuecomment-228431866","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/1068","id":228431866,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyODQzMTg2Ng==","user":{"login":"ydai1124","id":10764942,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzY0OTQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10764942?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydai1124","html_url":"https://github.com/ydai1124","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydai1124/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydai1124/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydai1124/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydai1124/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydai1124/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydai1124/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydai1124/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydai1124/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydai1124/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-24T18:58:09Z","updated_at":"2016-06-24T18:58:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Small comments.
