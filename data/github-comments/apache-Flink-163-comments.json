I totally agree with your point of keeping the current final variables related with `Execution` and `IntermediateResult`, etc. Although I already tried to avoid concurrent issues for these variables in implementation, it is still a good choice of creating the new ones to replace the previous ones, and I am willing to re-implement the related logics for this good idea.\r\n\r\n2. In the process of JobManagerRunner `grantLeadership`, considering not expose the new job leader to TaskManagers before reconcile, so the reconciliation process in JobManager will be called before `confirmLeadership` to avoid this issue. As you suggest, it can also make sense if creating JobManager and ExecutionGraph during reconciliation. Considering minimum changes, I will keep the current mode for this issue if no other reasons. What do you think?\r\n\r\n3. Two phases of the reconciliation mainly concerns about some actions during state transition. For example, if transition from `RECONCILING` to `RUNNING`, it should `sendPartitionInfos` in previous logic and this action relies on other upstream executions reconciliation. In other words, the upstream execution reconciliation would try to cache the partition infos in the `PartialInputChannelDeploymentDescriptor` of downstream execution. And when the downstream execution switches to `RUNNING`, this partition info will be sent to it. Because we can not confirm all the sequences of execution reconciliation, dividing the whole process into two steps can make sense for that. But after your latest improvements for `EAGER` `ScheduleMode`, I think the downstream task is submitted already with final upstream partition infos, so maybe it is no need to send partition infos for running downstream task again. If my understanding is correct, I can re-implement this part for merging the current two phases into one based on TaskManager reports.\r\nIn addition , for `FAILED` or `CANCELED` reported execution states, it would fail the whole ExecutionGraph as a result, so we can end the reconciliation period immediately, then the following reports will be refused and the corresponding tasks will be failed by TaskManagers. From JobManager side, when process the first `FAILED` or `CANCELED` reported state to trigger failing the ExecutionGraph, the other `RECONCILING` state executions will be transition to `CANCELED` state directly, no need to send cancel rpc message. What do you think?\r\n\r\nI will finish the above modifications during this week, and welcome any other advices!

Users could theoretically run into the size limit of an array list, and unnesting large messages (in multiple threads in the Kafka 0.8 case) can put pressure on the GC. We think that we should try to avoid that approach if possible.\r\n\r\nAlternative approaches we considered (ordered by preference):\r\n- Define the DeserializationSchema so that users can return `null` if the user doesn't want to emit a record.\r\nThis approach would not change the current approach, and is pretty minimal. Of course, it would not allow for the \"unnesting\" use case, where you want to emit multiple records from one Kafka message. Users would need to deserialize into a nested structure and use a flatMap afterwards to do the un-nesting.\r\n- Move the deserialization into the checkpoint lock. This would allow us to collect elements into our internal collector from the user collector while still preserving exactly once semantics.\r\nThis change would probably be a bit more involved code-wise, as we need to rearrange some parts (maybe moving the deserialization schema instance into the emitRecord() method, change of some method signatures).\r\nA downside of this approach would be that the Kafka 0.8 consumer threads would deserialize records in a sequential order (since only one consumer thread can hold the lock at a time). For Kafka 0.9 this is already the case. I think we can live with that, because the majority of users moved away from kafka 0.8 by now.\r\n- Use the `ArrayList` approach. Users would potentially run into issues and we would loose some of Flink's robustness.\r\n\r\n@jgrier since you've opened the original JIRA back then, what's your take on the discussion? How bad would it be for users to just allow the `null` or record approach? (Other opinions are of course also appreciated)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/282990765/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/282992843","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3418#issuecomment-282992843","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3418","id":282992843,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4Mjk5Mjg0Mw==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-28T09:49:11Z","updated_at":"2017-02-28T09:49:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hmm, I see.

It would make sense to pass the JM RPC port (which Kubernetes generates on-the-fly) as a dynamic property, e.g:\r\n```\r\nbin/flink-jobmanager.sh -Djobmanager.rpc.port=$PORT0\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe mesos jobmanager and taskmanager use this approach for similar reasons.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/283140290/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/283140607","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3425#issuecomment-283140607","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3425","id":283140607,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MzE0MDYwNw==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-28T19:38:15Z","updated_at":"2017-02-28T19:38:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the feedback @sunjincheng121 and @twalthr \r\n\r\nMerging this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/283140607/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/283194561","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3314#issuecomment-283194561","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3314","id":283194561,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MzE5NDU2MQ==","user":{"login":"jgrier","id":787242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NzI0Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/787242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgrier","html_url":"https://github.com/jgrier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgrier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgrier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgrier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgrier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgrier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgrier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgrier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgrier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgrier/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-28T23:25:45Z","updated_at":"2017-02-28T23:25:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think it would be just fine if we allowed a null return given the tradeoffs discussed here.

I completely agree with your suggestion on  \"reworking the batch design\". Actually I have proposed the same idea to \"rework the batch\" before your review (maybe you have missed my comment on Feb.27). I was hesitating to make the changes, as I want to keep this PR as dedicated as possible. But since the performance of the current design is a concern, let's do the clean up all together within this PR.  Regarding to \"pairwise merging\", I have different opinion, there are many aggregates that merging a list at once is much more efficient than merge just two. If we always use \"pairwise merging\" in the runtime, we will lose the advantage of merge(List) API defined in AggregateFunction interface. If the memory is a concern, we can limit the size of List for each merge iteration, I will provide the update very soon.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/283217475/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/283217840","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3335#issuecomment-283217840","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3335","id":283217840,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MzIxNzg0MA==","user":{"login":"EronWright","id":1775518,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzU1MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1775518?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EronWright","html_url":"https://github.com/EronWright","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EronWright/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EronWright/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EronWright/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EronWright/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EronWright/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EronWright/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EronWright/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EronWright/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EronWright/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-01T01:36:41Z","updated_at":"2017-03-01T01:36:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@WangTaoTheTonic can you elaborate on the multi-user scenario that you have in mind?
