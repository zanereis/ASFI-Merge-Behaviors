Therefore, it should never be used if we intend for static analysis to be useful/valuable practice\n\n@swill Speaking generally, my opinion is that the suggestion does not work.  The point of static analysis is to protect the integrity of the codebase.  If a patch introduces a new issue, it shouldn't be accepted until the issue is fixed.  The only exception to this rule is that we determine the rule is no longer valuable and stop checking it.  We only gain value from static analysis if we are disciplined about addressing the issues found rather than taking the most expedient path to get a pass.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/209222090/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/209224739","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1363#issuecomment-209224739","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1363","id":209224739,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwOTIyNDczOQ==","user":{"login":"swill","id":13644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill","html_url":"https://github.com/swill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-13T04:38:31Z","updated_at":"2016-04-13T04:38:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"So do we have 2 LGTM code reviews for this then?

@ProjectMoon correct resource naming is critical to the proper operation of the management server. We have had a significant bugs and production issues caused by subtle changes to resource naming strategies between releases where CloudStack suddenly can't find a resource on the device it is attempting to control. \n> \n> Have you performed any upgrade testing for this PR? If so, what tests have you performed in which configurations?\n\nWe have not specifically performed any upgrade testing. Our current stable version is based on 4.7.1, and essentially our \"upgrade testing\" has consisted of deploying 4.7.1 before and after our development of this feature was complete. The configuration has been tested with KVM, VmWare, and the simulator. \n\n> Also, could you please add an FS to the wiki and start a conversation on dev@? Given the importance of resource naming, it would be extremely helpful to have an explanation of the design and its operation.\n\nAs far as I know, I don't have access to the wiki. Otherwise I would add to it. Do I need to register a separate account or can I use my Apache JIRA account?\n\n> @ProjectMoon we'll need more information on why you're doing this, why we should have it, what is fixes and will it guarantee backward resource-name compatibility (for example, vmware vms have this strictly tie up with internal ACS vm name, such config are set in each vmware's VM's annotations) and upgrade paths\n- **Why we are doing this**: we implement our own naming scheme for the supported resources. On our 4.2 branch we hacked this in. But now we want to present a framework that we can extend, and open the possibility to others to do the same.\n- **Why should mainline have this**: More flexibility for developers, easier testing (static classes notoriously cause problems), a unified way to generate names (DRY principle).\n- **What it fixes**: It doesn't _fix_ anything per se, but the refactoring helps move us towards a cleaner codebase.\n- **Backwards compatibility**: The default plugin generates names and UUIDs in the exact same way as before, so yes.\n\nVmWare is an interesting case though. Can you describe in more detail/point me to where this stuff happens so I can verify that custom naming plugins will not break it?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/209875708/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/209893539","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1494#issuecomment-209893539","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1494","id":209893539,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwOTg5MzUzOQ==","user":{"login":"remibergsma","id":1630096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzAwOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1630096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma","html_url":"https://github.com/remibergsma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-14T11:43:41Z","updated_at":"2016-04-14T11:43:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@nlivens Please add a description because this confuses me ;-) You guys go the non-oss way? :-(\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/209893539/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/209896417","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1493#issuecomment-209896417","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1493","id":209896417,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwOTg5NjQxNw==","user":{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-14T11:48:23Z","updated_at":"2016-04-14T11:48:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"- Tested against KVM, mgmt server -

The problem is that we have so many cases of what not to do. I find it very good that you are willing to learn and help us improve the ACS code base.\n\nSo let’s go to the work.\n\nSure I changed the variable “logger” to protected, I needed to access it on a test case, so I changed it to an access delimiter that I could use; you should always try to use the most restrictive one, but at the end in Java those access delimiters can always be bypassed using Reflections. The protected delimiter states that children’s of that class and classes at the same package will have access to that variable/method.\n\nI also removed the “final” because I needed to change that variable to the test with a mocked one. The final delimiter would not allow that; therefore, I had to remove it. That is why I would normally avoid the use of final everywhere, it can complicate things. I would only use final where I really want to be strict and not allow a variable change on the fly.\n\nI removed the static to transform that variable into an “instance” attribute; those objects are spring beans, and they are working as singletons, there will be no more than one instance of them. That is why I see no reason to use that attribute as a class field.\nNow, you could go over all of the classes that extend “NfsSecondaryStorageResource”, they would have their own “logger” variable, then you could remove the “s_logger” they are using and use the one inherited. Additionally, you would be using a more common name for that variable that is “logger”. \n\nFor your second batch of questions, I prefer to use the most restrictive delimiter access possible. I always start with private and then I go opening them on a need basis. I have no idea why someone would do different, such as using “public static final” when it is not needed. ACS has a lot of code that should not be taken as reference. In doubt, you can always call for help; there are folks here that are great devs.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/210018309/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/210048954","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1492#issuecomment-210048954","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1492","id":210048954,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMDA0ODk1NA==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-14T17:00:14Z","updated_at":"2016-04-14T17:00:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Daan Hoogland  on dev@cloudstack.apache.org replies:\n=E2=80=8BI could imagine a policy that keeps a static counter and name a re=\nsource\nbla-<counter-value> and then checks if the next created resource has the\nright name for each newly created resource;

Therefore, if you want 5 classes to share the same logger, retrieve the logger for that class by name in each class to avoid the potential pitfalls of static shadowing (i.e. instead of declaring `private static final Logger LOGGER = Logger.getLogger(MyClass.class)`, declare it as `private static final Logger LOGGER = Logger.getLogger(CONSTANT_WITH_THE_NAME_OF_ COMMON_LOGGER)`).\n\nAs I mentioned in a previous comment, these type of compiler gymnastics are not necessary to test log output.

The issue is not one of style but performance and availability.  The garbage collector skips reachability evaluations of `final static` fields where it must perform those for instance variables.  This cost adds up when a large number of object is allocated and deallocated.  Second, you cannot log from a static method.  Our standard in the codebase is to have `final static` loggers, and I don't see a compelling reason to step away from it.\n\nIn terms of the Mockito approach, I wouldn't have an opinion if the unit test where not requiring us to change the class.  The test should always be the servant of the system not the other way around.
