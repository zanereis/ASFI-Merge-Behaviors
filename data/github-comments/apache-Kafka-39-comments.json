However, I think we could do it at build time instead of runtime. That way the scripts wouldn't need to \"hardcode\" their project dependencies and we could leave that logic in the gradle build. The gradle build is where we define what dependencies are required. We could still deduplicate jars too.\n\nIt makes the build a little more complicated, but one way to do this while building would be:\n- place artifacts in a central lib dir\n- place dependencies in a central deps dir\n- symlink all deps from the central dirs in the modules dependency dir\n  - Not sure about windows here as I am less familiar with linking\n- use the changes in this patch that define the project and load that projects classpath only\n  - Only difference is you only define 1 project, not multiple. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/176333803/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/176334249","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/693#issuecomment-176334249","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/693","id":176334249,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3NjMzNDI0OQ==","user":{"login":"granthenke","id":1928566,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Mjg1NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1928566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke","html_url":"https://github.com/granthenke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-28T18:48:47Z","updated_at":"2016-01-28T18:48:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@ZoneMayor I apologize for not bringing this up earlier.
