Especially, for MERGE. The range distribution requires sampling that leads to double scanning and re-evaluating of particular nodes in the plan. This will cause the same issues we have today where the default would perform poorly. \r\n\r\nThe upcoming Spark 3.4 has support for rebalancing partitions via AQE for hash distributions requested by v2 writes. That means, we can request a hash distribution without worrying about having too much data per task and OOM. I'd rather switch to `hash` as default and let users configure if it fails.

Would we add success on just the first time?

Where would we keep the success file then? Again the source of truth for an iceberg table is only known by reading the current metadata.json so the Java APIs are the way to go if you don't want to use Spark or trino. \n\nOr if you want you can just listen for changes in the catalog, whenever metadata location properly has changed, you know the table has been committed to.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1414972569/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1415230512","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/6695#issuecomment-1415230512","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/6695","id":1415230512,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85UWrQw","user":{"login":"ajantha-bhat","id":5889404,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODk0MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5889404?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat","html_url":"https://github.com/ajantha-bhat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-03T07:33:48Z","updated_at":"2023-02-03T07:33:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@aokolnychyi: back ported PR details. \r\n3.2: https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/6730\r\n3.1: https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/6731\r\n2.4: https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/6733","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1415230512/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1415254316","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/6725#issuecomment-1415254316","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/6725","id":1415254316,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85UWxEs","user":{"login":"0xffmeta","id":98149057,"node_id":"U_kgDOBdmiwQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98149057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/0xffmeta","html_url":"https://github.com/0xffmeta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0xffmeta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0xffmeta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0xffmeta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0xffmeta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0xffmeta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0xffmeta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0xffmeta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0xffmeta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0xffmeta/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-03T07:46:48Z","updated_at":"2023-02-03T07:46:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"For our case, we just need to add success file for the first time to let the downstream know that the daily or hourly partition is ready to consume.
