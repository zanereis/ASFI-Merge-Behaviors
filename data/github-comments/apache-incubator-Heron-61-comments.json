If I understand correctly, rate limit is configured at the topology level.

If the output is throttled, input queues of the component will fill up and cause back-pressure. Back-pressure will be seen as soon as rate limit is applied and I don't think it matters where the rate limit is applied.

And this is different from backpressure. Backpressure is a state that the stmgr gets into and at that time it stops reading from spouts. On the other hand, rate limiting is simply reading at a certain rate from the connection of spout instance inside the stmgr. This should be something that you do during connection setup. This doesnt require any kind of handshaking, etc between stmgr/spout instance. And because stmgr uses libevent as the read interface, its literally just a matter of calling one function on the connection.

So the default container (of 4 instances) will request 4 cores. If the value of `heron.resources.instance.cpu` is changed to `0.5`, the same default container (4 instances) will request 2 cores, or 3 cores for 5 instances. This seems fine to me.\r\n\r\nHi @aahmed-se, can you provide more details about the `whole number` test-case you mentioned in the description?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/373546669/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/373563356","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/issues/2777#issuecomment-373563356","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/2777","id":373563356,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MzU2MzM1Ng==","user":{"login":"aahmed-se","id":8009085,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMDkwODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8009085?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aahmed-se","html_url":"https://github.com/aahmed-se","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aahmed-se/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aahmed-se/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aahmed-se/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aahmed-se/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aahmed-se/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aahmed-se/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aahmed-se/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aahmed-se/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aahmed-se/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-16T00:17:08Z","updated_at":"2018-03-16T00:17:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":" Existing topology with this config  fails\r\n```\r\ncom.twitter.heron.api.Config.setContainerCpuRequested(conf, 0.5f);\r\n```\r\nHere is the error message from logs \r\n```\r\n[2018-03-13 21:24:41 +0000] [ERROR]: This instance requires containers \r\nwith at least true cpu cores.
