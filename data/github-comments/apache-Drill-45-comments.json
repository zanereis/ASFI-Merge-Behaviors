regarding your concerns:\r\n\r\n- I suppose you are right that there is no need to dump all operators up to a failed one (though having this information may help recreating fragment operators in some cases). Dump from the failed batch might suffice in most cases. Maybe we should consider configuration parameter for number of batches to be dumped?\r\n\r\n- This `DumpCat` relies on Trace operator which should be injected to physical plan (see comments in [Implement Diagnostic Operator](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DRILL-256)) and it seems that TraceInjector, which traverses the set of operators and injects trace operator before every operator is not invoked anywhere, since the trace operator does not support hyper vectors. Moreover this feature is poorly documented (and may appear unreliable as it is not being tested/accounted for since it was added almost 5 years ago and there are no recent jiras for the subject). And lastly, script to run this tool (`DumpCat`) is not shipped in Drill's distribution ([Remove dumpcat script from Drill distribution](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DRILL-4751)) rendering it hard for users to use it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/422468101/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/422488147","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1467#issuecomment-422488147","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1467","id":422488147,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMjQ4ODE0Nw==","user":{"login":"priteshm","id":1015719,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTU3MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1015719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshm","html_url":"https://github.com/priteshm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-18T17:54:25Z","updated_at":"2018-09-18T17:54:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@bitblender with this PR open, should the old PR be closed? https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/875 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/422488147/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/422502847","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/875#issuecomment-422502847","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/875","id":422502847,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMjUwMjg0Nw==","user":{"login":"karthik-man","id":430469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDQ2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/430469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karthik-man","html_url":"https://github.com/karthik-man","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karthik-man/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karthik-man/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karthik-man/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karthik-man/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karthik-man/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karthik-man/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karthik-man/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karthik-man/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karthik-man/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-18T18:40:12Z","updated_at":"2018-09-18T18:40:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1467 covers the changes required for DRILL-5671.
