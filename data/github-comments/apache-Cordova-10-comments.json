This is behaviour of NPM, not something that Cordova controls.\r\n\r\nRunning `npm -g upgrade` should upgrade all global packages to the latest versions possible (while satisfying version pins) which should solve your large list of deprecated packages, but if you have other global packages that have strict version pins it may hold them back.\r\n\r\n`npm -g ls <packageName>` can also be used to find where some of those packages are being used if any are being held back.\r\n\r\nIf you have other global packages that are causing these dependencies to be held back, then you might be able to use a project-local install instead by doing `npm install cordova --save-dev` in your project directory. Then prefix any cordova commands with `npx` to use the project-local install, e.g: `npx cordova build android`. This should eliminate any influence on global installed packages, but I'm not 100% sure if local installs actually works completely.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/2271574498/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/2315207768","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cordova/issues/490#issuecomment-2315207768","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/490","id":2315207768,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBzvngc6J_0RY","user":{"login":"breautek","id":11200662,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjAwNjYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11200662?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek","html_url":"https://github.com/breautek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-28T12:37:51Z","updated_at":"2024-08-28T12:37:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm moving this to Cordova Discussions since it doesn't describe a bug with Cordova-Android.\r\n\r\nCordova-android 12 -> 13 doesn't introduce any breaking changes involving surrounding the Cordova API.

Any idea why this behavior in Cordova? Is it possible to get the same tokens generation effect in Cordova without using a websocket connection?\r\n\r\nTo my knowledge, Cordova doesn't do anything to effect the behaviour of server side events (SSE) or web sockets and they should work out of the box providing that the client is configured with the proper CSP policy on the client, and CORS policy on the server side. Cordova is afterall, a packager. It does not implement the browser features like websockets or SSE. Cordova does allow plugins, so unless if you have a plugin installed that overrides the `EventSource` JS object, then you're using the standard browser feature as implemented in the webview. Cordova itself doesn't implement any Event emitter plugins.\r\n\r\nThe browser application and the webview are two different components on the device and they could be built with different configurations, so there could be a difference of behaviour, but as long as the server is following the protocol I wouldn't expect any significant difference.\r\n\r\nI'm not familiar with the Java library that you're using so I'll speak for a more general sense. For SSE, the server should be:\r\n1. Responding with `Content-Type: text/event-stream` header\r\n2. Use double newline character (`\\n`) to indicate the end of an event package. If you're dealing with small data chunks, the server might have to explicitly flush the socket to forcefully send data through.\r\n\r\nIf the server is sending data without events, then the client should be listening for messages on the `.onmessage` handler/event. Otherwise the client should use `.addEventListener(\"eventName\")`.\r\n\r\nFor example if the server sends `ping:\\n\\n` it will send a `ping` event, which the client can listen for `.addEventListener(\"ping\", ...)`.\r\n\r\nI'd assume that your `SseEmitter` class would be handling these details, but if you want to rule it out potential issues with the `SseEmitter` implementation, it's fairly straight forward implementing your own SSE emitter using a raw http server. If it works consistently on both the webviews and browsers with your own emitter server, then it would indicate a problem inside the `SseEmitter` implementation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/2405661989/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/2405925018","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cordova/issues/500#issuecomment-2405925018","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/500","id":2405925018,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBzvngc6PZ4Ca","user":{"login":"yonoss","id":4145186,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNDUxODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4145186?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonoss","html_url":"https://github.com/yonoss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonoss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonoss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonoss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonoss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonoss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonoss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonoss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonoss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonoss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-10T19:56:45Z","updated_at":"2024-10-10T19:56:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@breautek Thanks for your reply!\r\nI don't believe there is a problem with the back end or with the javascript EventSource handling code, as it is working correctly on standard browsers, on both PC and mobile phones.

To do this, you'll need to put an xml file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\r\n<network-security-config>\r\n    <base-config cleartextTrafficPermitted=\"true\"/>\r\n</network-security-config>\r\n```\r\n\r\ninside `platforms/android/app/src/main/res/xml/networkPolicy.xml`\r\n\r\nAnd inside `platforms/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`, the `<application>` tag needs the following attribute: `android:networkSecurityConfig=\"@xml/networkPolicy\"`.\r\n\r\nIf a zip can be provided that demonstrates the issue in a basic project, I'll try to take a look in a reasonable timeframe.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/2407506112/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/2450255032","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cordova/issues/505#issuecomment-2450255032","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/505","id":2450255032,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBzvngc6SC-y4","user":{"login":"mahnunchik","id":780935,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MDkzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/780935?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahnunchik","html_url":"https://github.com/mahnunchik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahnunchik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahnunchik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahnunchik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahnunchik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahnunchik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahnunchik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahnunchik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahnunchik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahnunchik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-31T09:15:29Z","updated_at":"2024-10-31T10:37:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Related:\r\n\r\n*
