This causes problem in the following scenario:\r\n\r\n- Thread A calls `poll(...)` and is blocked on `select(...)`\r\n- Thread B enqueues a request into `unsent` of ConsumerNetworkClient for node `N`\r\n- Thread A calls `checkDisconnects(now)` -> `client.connectionFailed(N)`\r\n- Because no attempts have been made to connection to node `N` yet, there is no state for node `N` and `connectionFailed(N)` would throw exception.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to only consider a connection has failed if attempts have been made to connect to this node AND the connection state is `DISCONNECTED`.

hmm one problem :) This is coming from a long overflow, but only hits us because `now` is set to a value before the create time in failure runs.\r\n\r\nIf you look at the [first screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6490959/23581016/f1852054-010c-11e7-9a7f-574937b5060f.png) (in the PR description) you can see `now > this.createdMs` does not always hold in practice (I can easily reproduce this running the test in a loop ... only the `linger == 1h` actually fixed the issue :().\r\nThe overflow in this case is not fixed by `now - this.createdMs - lingerMs`, neither is it by my initial solution of `now - Math.max(this.createdMs + lingerMs, lingerMs))`. \r\nWhat you would need here is `Math.max(0, now - this.createdMs) - lingerMs` (this would be safe for any positive lingerMs imo).\r\nSorry for missing this initially, for 1h linger time this didn't matter since the small negative difference there was just eaten up by 3.6M `ms`.\r\n\r\nBut my question would be: Is `now < this.createdMs` even a valid case to handle here? (In that case I have it fixed by `Math.max(0, now - this.createdMs) - lingerMs` + UT :) )","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/284319038/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/284320800","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2639#issuecomment-284320800","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2639","id":284320800,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NDMyMDgwMA==","user":{"login":"original-brownbear","id":6490959,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTA5NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6490959?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear","html_url":"https://github.com/original-brownbear","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-06T07:23:13Z","updated_at":"2017-03-06T07:23:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@ijuma pushed my fix + test case, probably easier to understand from that than form my explaination :D \r\nBut that said ... imo it makes sense to properly handle negative timestamp differences here when talking about expiration (just natural to say X expires at timestamp Y so timestamp befor X is not expired) in general.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/284320800/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
