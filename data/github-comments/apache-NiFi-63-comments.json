See, If you right click on the connection's 'line' you get the context menu and can then choose to config/view config so I was thinking we should add that 'quickSelect' open config/view config to the 'line' as well as the 'start', 'end', or 'middle' nodes. The problem with this is that we already have an action for double click on the 'line' (that action is for adding a bend). So maybe @moranr could chime in here....\r\n\r\nCurrently the way it is with this PR you can double click the the stats box or an existing bend on a connection's 'line' to open the config dialog for the connection. However, if you double click on the 'line' you will add a bend to the connection rather than opening the connections' config dialog. Is this the expected behavior? Or, do we want to change the current behavior such that when you double click on a 'line' for a connection you will open the connection's config dialog (just like double click everywhere else on a connection) and then we can add an action to the 'right click - context menu' to 'Add Bend' to make it more explicit to the user....thoughts?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/318439501/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/318445436","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2009#issuecomment-318445436","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2009","id":318445436,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxODQ0NTQzNg==","user":{"login":"yuri1969","id":13468636,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDY4NjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13468636?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuri1969","html_url":"https://github.com/yuri1969","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuri1969/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuri1969/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuri1969/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuri1969/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuri1969/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuri1969/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuri1969/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuri1969/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuri1969/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-27T18:22:16Z","updated_at":"2017-07-27T18:22:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"- I find it natural to double-click on the 'line' when I want to add a new bend.\r\n- In order to check connection's config I would try to double-click on its rectangular stats box.\r\n- Connection's 'nodes' being able to open the config dialog feels OK to me.

If you agree with it, can you add it into your PR and I'll get everything merged?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/319679836/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/319720252","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1961#issuecomment-319720252","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1961","id":319720252,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxOTcyMDI1Mg==","user":{"login":"MikeThomsen","id":108184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODE4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeThomsen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-02T16:09:44Z","updated_at":"2017-08-02T16:09:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bbende Done.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/319720252/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/319872059","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2020#issuecomment-319872059","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2020","id":319872059,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxOTg3MjA1OQ==","user":{"login":"cammach","id":23346943,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMzQ2OTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23346943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cammach","html_url":"https://github.com/cammach","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cammach/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cammach/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cammach/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cammach/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cammach/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cammach/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cammach/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cammach/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cammach/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-03T05:31:48Z","updated_at":"2017-08-03T05:33:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @rickysaltzer , I have figured out the Record Reader reference issue, and fixed it.

@MikeThomsen , two minor issues while testing this...\r\n\r\n1) There is a try-with-resource block that creates the RecordReader, and as part of that line it also creates an InputStream for the flow

encoding strategy was \"Bytes\", which is different from how PutHBaseJson works.\r\n\r\nI went ahead and addressed these issues in my own

The backward compatibility support for legacy configurations is also solid. One minor thing I'd like to investigate further if we can remove the dependency between the nifi-security-utils and the nifi-properties-loader. The nifi-security-utils are referenced and pulled into many NARs and the additional dependency would introduce further duplication of the nifi-properties-loader jar (and it's transitive dependencies not already included). This dependency is only used to load the master key from the bootstrap.conf. While it's not a showstopper, it would be nice if we didn't need this additional dependency and instead allowed the client of the nifi-security-utils provide the master key when necessary.\r\n\r\nThanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/320255991/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/320283722","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2020#issuecomment-320283722","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2020","id":320283722,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMDI4MzcyMg==","user":{"login":"rickysaltzer","id":347356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NzM1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/347356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickysaltzer","html_url":"https://github.com/rickysaltzer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickysaltzer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickysaltzer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickysaltzer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickysaltzer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickysaltzer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickysaltzer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickysaltzer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickysaltzer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickysaltzer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-04T15:49:10Z","updated_at":"2017-08-04T15:49:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've got your changes locally to do some testing, thanks!

I think these lines should be fixed -- I understand wanting to print the incoming information to help with debugging, but I don't think the raw token should be printed here, so there should be some control logic or the `#toString()` method should be overridden. \r\n\r\n```\r\n2017-08-08 19:21:18,784 INFO [NiFi Web Server-18] o.a.n.w.s.NiFiAuthenticationFilter Attempting request for (eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJhbG9wcmVzdG8uYXBhY2hlQGdtYWlsLmNvbSIsImlzcyI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYWNjb3VudHMuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbSIsImF1ZCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYWNjb3VudHMuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbSIsInByZWZlcnJlZF91c2VybmFtZSI6ImFsb3ByZXN0by5hcGFjaGVAZ21haWwuY29tIiwia2lkIjoxLCJleHAiOjE1MDIyNDg4NzcsImlhdCI6MTUwMjI0NTI3OH0.hHb4zJljXgv9ja_x46nFjxkYAXgGmuPXtJEm44Mrxj4) GET https://localhost:9443/nifi-api/flow/current-user (source ip: 127.0.0.1)\r\n2017-08-08 19:21:18,839 INFO [NiFi Web Server-18] o.a.n.w.s.NiFiAuthenticationFilter Authentication success for alopresto.apache@gmail.com\r\n2017-08-08 19:21:18,918 INFO [NiFi Web Server-84] o.a.n.w.s.NiFiAuthenticationFilter Attempting request for (eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJhbG9wcmVzdG8uYXBhY2hlQGdtYWlsLmNvbSIsImlzcyI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYWNjb3VudHMuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbSIsImF1ZCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYWNjb3VudHMuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbSIsInByZWZlcnJlZF91c2VybmFtZSI6ImFsb3ByZXN0by5hcGFjaGVAZ21haWwuY29tIiwia2lkIjoxLCJleHAiOjE1MDIyNDg4NzcsImlhdCI6MTUwMjI0NTI3OH0.hHb4zJljXgv9ja_x46nFjxkYAXgGmuPXtJEm44Mrxj4) GET https://localhost:9443/nifi-api/flow/client-id (source ip: 127.0.0.1)\r\n2017-08-08 19:21:18,920 INFO [NiFi Web Server-84] o.a.n.w.s.NiFiAuthenticationFilter Authentication success for alopresto.apache@gmail.com\r\n```\r\n(Note, the token decodes via Base64 to the following:)\r\n\r\n```\r\nhw12203:...space/nifi/nifi-assembly/target/nifi-1.4.0-SNAPSHOT-bin/nifi-1.4.0-SNAPSHOT (pr2047) alopresto\r\n🔓 102500s @ 19:30:55 $ b64d eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9\r\n{\"alg\":\"HS256\"}\r\nhw12203:...space/nifi/nifi-assembly/target/nifi-1.4.0-SNAPSHOT-bin/nifi-1.4.0-SNAPSHOT (pr2047) alopresto\r\n🔓 102652s @ 19:33:27 $ b64d eyJzdWIiOiJhbG9wcmVzdG8uYXBhY2hlQGdtYWlsLmNvbSIsImlzcyI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYWNjb3VudHMuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbSIsImF1ZCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYWNjb3VudHMuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbSIsInByZWZlcnJlZF91c2VybmFtZSI6ImFsb3ByZXN0by5hcGFjaGVAZ21haWwuY29tIiwia2lkIjoxLCJleHAiOjE1MDIyNDg4NzcsImlhdCI6MTUwMjI0NTI3OH0\r\n{\"sub\":\"alopresto.apache@gmail.com\",\"iss\":\"https://accounts.google.com\",\"aud\":\"https://accounts.google.com\",\"preferred_username\":\"alopresto.apache@gmail.com\",\"kid\":1,\"exp\":1502248877,\"iat\":150224527\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/321134998/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/321245846","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2047#issuecomment-321245846","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2047","id":321245846,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMTI0NTg0Ng==","user":{"login":"mcgilman","id":123395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzM5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman","html_url":"https://github.com/mcgilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-09T12:51:14Z","updated_at":"2017-08-09T12:51:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@alopresto This is not something that was introduced in this PR though I am happy to address it here.

This provider can integrate with other providers, including Google, Facebook, etc. and also have its own custom users stored locally. @mcgilman and I were able to receive a success response from Auth0 for a custom user, but the token signature could not be validated. We traced this to determine that on startup, when the `TokenValidator` is initialized, if no `nifi.security.user.oidc.preferred.jwsalgorithm` is present in `nifi.properties`, the first value of `id_token_signing_alg_values_supported` in the response from the OpenID Connect Discovery Document URI is used. In Auth0's case, this was `HS256` as opposed to `RS256`, but the tokens returned were signed with `RS256`, resulting in NiFi returning an error \"Unable to exchange authorization for ID token: Unable to parse the response from the Token request: Signed JWT rejected: Another algorithm expected, or no matching key(s) found\". \r\n\r\nThe Auth0 OIDC Discovery Document response:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\"issuer\":\"https://apachenifi.auth0.com/\",\"authorization_endpoint\":\"https://apachenifi.auth0.com/authorize\",\"token_endpoint\":\"https://apachenifi.auth0.com/oauth/token\",\"userinfo_endpoint\":\"https://apachenifi.auth0.com/userinfo\",\"mfa_challenge_endpoint\":\"https://apachenifi.auth0.com/mfa/challenge\",\"jwks_uri\":\"https://apachenifi.auth0.com/.well-known/jwks.json\",\"registration_endpoint\":\"https://apachenifi.auth0.com/oidc/register\",\"scopes_supported\":[\"openid\",\"profile\",\"offline_access\",\"name\",\"given_name\",\"family_name\",\"nickname\",\"email\",\"email_verified\",\"picture\",\"created_at\",\"identities\",\"phone\",\"address\"],\"response_types_supported\":[\"code\",\"token\",\"id_token\",\"code token\",\"code id_token\",\"token id_token\",\"code token id_token\"],\"response_modes_supported\":[\"query\",\"fragment\",\"form_post\"],\"subject_types_supported\":[\"public\"],\"id_token_signing_alg_values_supported\":[\"HS256\",\"RS256\"],\"token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported\":[\"client_secret_basic\",\"client_secret_post\"],\"claims_supported\":[\"aud\",\"auth_time\",\"created_at\",\"email\",\"email_verified\",\"exp\",\"family_name\",\"given_name\",\"iat\",\"identities\",\"iss\",\"name\",\"nickname\",\"phone_number\",\"picture\",\"sub\"]}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe decided to change the initialization logic to default to `RS256` as it is required by the [OpenID Connect Specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderMetadata) to always be present in this response. \r\n\r\n> id_token_signing_alg_values_supported\r\n> REQUIRED.

I haven't run it yet, but I have a few starter questions after looking over some of the code:\r\n\r\n1. What was the driver behind updating the AWS SDK version?\r\n1. Although the service interfaces and their methods are named specific to encryption, the substance of their interaction are not necessarily limited to encryption.  What would you think about making the interfaces more generic?  For example:\r\n    * Could the S3ClientSideEncryptionService be \"S3ClientService\" with only `getClient` methods, with the `needsEncryptedClient()` logic being performed internally by the concrete implementation StandardS3ClientSideEncryptionService.  I can see a number of use cases beyond encryption that could be covered by a custom client factory.\r\n    * Could the S3ServerSideEncryptionService be a more generic S3 put request modifier?  My efforts at thinking up a good name failed miserably here.
