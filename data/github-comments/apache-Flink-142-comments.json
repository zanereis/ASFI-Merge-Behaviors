The problem is not with the evaluate(test: TestType): DataSet[Double] but rather with evaluate(test: TestType): DataSet[(Prediction,Prediction)].\r\n\r\nCompletely agree there, I advocated for removing/renaming the evaluate function, we considered using a `score` function for a more sklearn-like approach before, see e.g. #902. Having _some_ function that returns a `DataSet[(truth: Prediction,pred: Prediction)]` is useful and probably necessary, but we should look at alternatives as the current state is confusing.\r\nI think I like the approach you are suggesting, so feel free to come up with an alternative in the WIP PRs.\r\n\r\nGetting rid of the Pipeline requirements for recommendation algorithms would simplify some things. In that case we'll have to re-evaluate if it makes sense for them to implement the `Predictor` interface at all, or maybe we have `ChainablePredictors` but I think our hierarchy is deep enough already.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/262992930/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/263001482","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2857#issuecomment-263001482","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2857","id":263001482,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MzAwMTQ4Mg==","user":{"login":"StefanRRichter","id":2128543,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjg1NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2128543?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter","html_url":"https://github.com/StefanRRichter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-25T17:24:32Z","updated_at":"2016-11-25T17:24:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I introduced the planned change to the test.

Forbid TableFunction implemented by Scala object, since the `collect` is called on a singleton. It will be error-prone in some concurrent cases.\r\n2. Check correct errors if a SQL query refers to a function in FROM that has not been registered or which is a ScalarFunction.\r\n3. Make `TableFunction` and `ScalarFunction` clean, **remove `UserDefinedFunction`**, and move eval relative functions and `createSqlFunction` to utils.\r\n4. Rename `ScalarFunctions` to `SqlFunctions` because contains also TableFunction logic.\r\n5. Restructure tests. Test Java Table API by comparing the RelNode of two tables. And check SQL API's DataSetRel and DataStreamRel via `TableTestBase` utils. The tests reduced into `stream/UserDefinedTableFunctionITCase`, `batch/UserDefinedTableFunctionITCase`, and `stream/UserDefinedTableFunctionTest` , `batch/UserDefinedTableFunctionTest`.\r\n6. Scala Table API implicitly convert `TableFunction` into `TableFunctionCall`. `TableFunctionCall` is not an `Expression` or `LogicalNode`, but is like `GroupWindow`, can be visible to the users (contains API such `as(...)`).\r\n7. Fix the hierarchy type extraction problem.\r\n8.

Currently, when externalized checkpoints are configured and the cluster shuts down via suspending all jobs, the externalized checkpoints are cleaned up. This PR proposes to handle suspension like a cancellation and respect the corresponding cleanup configuration, e.g. retain if `RETAIN_ON_CANCELLATION` and delete if `DELETE_ON_CANCELLATION`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/263262364/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/263262841","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2752#issuecomment-263262841","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2752","id":263262841,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MzI2Mjg0MQ==","user":{"login":"uce","id":1756620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTY2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1756620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce","html_url":"https://github.com/uce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-28T12:47:43Z","updated_at":"2016-11-28T12:47:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@StephanEwen Do you have time to look at this?
