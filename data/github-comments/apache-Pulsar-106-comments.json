If not, maybe that’s a simple fix to go first with setting a unique consumer name in functions.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/486885145/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/486886474","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/4137#issuecomment-486886474","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/4137","id":486886474,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4Njg4NjQ3NA==","user":{"login":"jerrypeng","id":3613359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTMzNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3613359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng","html_url":"https://github.com/jerrypeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-26T00:48:23Z","updated_at":"2019-04-26T00:48:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@sijie I just tested with consumers with consumer name set as UUIDs, yet they still get returned as the same instance.

\r\n\r\nCurrent presto integration bypasses Pulsar's schema's implementation and interacts with *avro schema data* directly. It introduces several problems:\r\n\r\n1) all the *properties* are lost when presto gets splits.\r\n2) it doesn't handle schema versions properly. \r\n3) it introduces a lot of duplicated code that has already been implemented in pulsar schema. it makes maintenance very hard.\r\n\r\nHence I don't think we should continue using the current approach for supporting other schema types. \r\n\r\nThis is a WIP for demonstrating the approach I mentioned in #4022 to supporting primitive types in Presto.

@sijie @srkukarni \r\n\r\nApproaches I thought of:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. If we don't want to pull in pulsar-client-api and we want to the users to be able to get all of the properties of a Message<T>, then we will have to add the corresponding methods to the Record interface to expos all the properties.  \r\n\r\nPros: pulsar-function-api do not need to depend on pulsar-client-api\r\n\r\nCons: As @sijie mentioned before, we need properties/methods are add to Message<T>, we will also need to add them to the Record interface.  However, my biggest concern with this approach is that we already have methods like ``` getRecordSequence``` in the Record interface (which is different then the message sequence id though they return different forms of the same thing).  We will have to add another method getSequenceId to the Record interface which will be confusing.  Thus, I am not for this method\r\n\r\n2. We add an additional method to PulsarRecord i.e. ```public Message<T> getRawMessage()```.  Add an method to the Context interface i.e. ```pubic Message<T> getRawInputMessage```.  In the implementation of the method, we will just cast Record to PulsarRecord which is assumed for functions anyways.\r\n\r\nPros: Simple addition\r\n\r\nCons: pulsar-function-api need to depend on pulsar-client-api. Though this is not a deal breaker for me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/487429075/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/487429328","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/4127#issuecomment-487429328","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/4127","id":487429328,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NzQyOTMyOA==","user":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-29T00:43:30Z","updated_at":"2019-04-29T00:43:30Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@jerrypeng have you checked my initial proposal?
