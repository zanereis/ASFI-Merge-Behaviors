Can you plz explain more?\r\n\r\nI  try to give 1 summary for this part.  :-)\r\nIn orginal IoTDB maven design, client-cpp's compiling procedure is as below:\r\n1) download cmake-3.17.3-Linux-x86_64.tar.gz and untar it.  (in maven phase <**generate-sources**>)\r\n2) download thrif 0.14.1 src code tar and untar it  (in maven phase <**generate-sources**>)\r\n3) use cmake to process thrift 0.14.1 src codes. (in maven phase <**generate-sources**>)\r\n4)  chmod +x cmake     (in maven phase <**process-sources**>)\r\n5) compile thrift 0.14.1  src code.  (in maven phase <**compile**>)  \r\n6)  more thrift generating work.   \r\n\r\nso, in above procedure, the step-4's postion should be 1 bug. \r\nI guess that step-4 's orginal goal is to avoid new-downloaded cmake file has no executable permission, and step-4 should be run before step-3.\r\nBut in origin codes, the step-4 was put in wrongly maven phase **process-sources**,  which casues it is run after step-3.\r\n\r\n**Note:** Of course, if the new-downloaded cmake file is originally executable, the step-4 is useless.\r\n\r\nMy codes change is that:\r\n1) change the step-4's maven phase to **generate-sources**\r\n2) adjust step-4's position in pom.xml.\r\nso let \"chmod +x cmake\"  happen just after step-2. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/926373461/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/926408363","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iotdb/pull/4022#issuecomment-926408363","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/4022","id":926408363,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCXnElM43N96r","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-24T07:27:53Z","updated_at":"2021-09-24T07:27:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\n[![Coverage

@ericpai Please take a look again :D\r\n\r\nThe code is OK now. Here I have another one question about the design.\r\n\r\n_Does the result of wildcard path query of `const` function really satisfy user's actual requirement?_ \r\n\r\n   For example there're 2 timeseries root.sg.d1.s1, root.sg.d1.s2. And we have a query `SELECT const(*, type='int32', value='10') FROM root.sg.d1`.  In our logic, the function will be separated into two columns `const(root.sg.d1.s1, type='int32', 'value'='10')` and `const(root.sg.d1.s2, type='int32', 'value'='10')` right? But maybe a user wants a single column with the union timestamps of all the measurements of `root.sg.d1`.  Moreover the user can't specify every timeseries in the parameters as there're so many ones.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/927450310/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/927452451","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iotdb/pull/4033#issuecomment-927452451","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/4033","id":927452451,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCXnElM43R80j","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-27T02:13:15Z","updated_at":"2021-09-27T02:13:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\n[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/builds/43075879/badge)](https://coveralls.io/builds/43075879)\n\nCoverage decreased (-0.02%) to 67.459% when pulling **e34cd5f4a7ccc5da8409e3148d6b77498eded92e on const** into **bc3b736834b364ce4fddeed3780de8655ec33e03 on master**.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/927452451/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/927453859","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iotdb/pull/4033#issuecomment-927453859","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/4033","id":927453859,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCXnElM43R9Kj","user":{"login":"sonarqubecloud[bot]","id":39514782,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mzk1MTQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/12526?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/sonarqubecloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-27T02:16:15Z","updated_at":"2021-09-27T02:16:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"SonarCloud Quality Gate failed.&nbsp;

Since `GenericKeyedObjectPool` is thread-safe, the former is resolved. Moreover the use of `setTestOnReturn` and `setTestOnBorrow` in `GenericKeyedObjectPoolConfig` also guarantees the failing client will not be used again. So I think the external behavior of the PR and the previous version should be consistent in theory. Since the test results show almost no performance differences, I will merge the more readable clientPool implementation.\r\n\r\nThe failed CI has nothing to do with the branch and will be fixed during a cluster- branch merge.\r\n\r\nThanks @chengjianyun  for your excellent
