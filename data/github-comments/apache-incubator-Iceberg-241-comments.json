think in a lot of cases we don't necessarily need `.describedAs(..)` / `.as(..)` as the context that is being provided when a check fails is usually enough. Taking the below example:\r\n```\r\nAssert.assertTrue(\"OSS file should exist\", ossClient().get().doesObjectExist(uri.bucket(), uri.key()));\r\nAssert.assertEquals(\"Should have expected location\", location, out.location());\r\nAssert.assertEquals(\"Should have expected length\", dataSize, ossDataLength(uri));\r\nAssert.assertArrayEquals(\"Should have expected content\", data, ossDataContent(uri, dataSize));\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich could be rewritten to:\r\n```\r\nAssertions.assertThat(ossClient().get().doesObjectExist(uri.bucket(), uri.key())).as(\"OSS file should exist\").isTrue();\r\nAssertions.assertThat(out.location()).isEqualTo(location);\r\nAssertions.assertThat(ossDataLength(uri)).isEqualTo(dataSize);\r\nAssertions.assertThat(ossDataContent(uri, dataSize)).isEqualTo(data);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat being said, we should just double-check when transitioning/reviewing where it makes sense to have a failure description / overriding error msg.\r\n\r\nIt's also worth mentioning that there are scripts available to convert assertions:

I encountered it a few times but sorry I cannot recall what were the checkstyle errors.\r\n\r\nAt least my goal is to remove as much need for human-linting as possible. This is one case, there are also cases about styles of newlines that we sometimes still human-lint. If adding some checkstyle rules means we no longer need to check those styles and the developer him/herself has to fix some checkstyle error I am actually fine with that.

We get data on Kafka and we deliver it to the data lake. We have built this connector to sink the data to iceberg tables, specifically AWS Athena in parquet format \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/10xfuturetechnologies/kafka-connect-iceberg\r\n\r\nWe sink the data to the blob store keeping the record schema for audibility and we create iceberg tables exposing a subset of the data. However now and then we have to expose additional columns in the table retroactively, i.e. data from records older than the date when the column was added also need to show up in the table. Backfilling would be a very expensive option for us.

And secondly, without this PR, we will likely also contribute things like CloudWatch, SQS and SNS metrics reporter.\r\n\r\nSo the questions maybe you could help share your opinions are that:\r\n1. would it work if we contribute CloudWatch, SQS and SNS metrics reporters, such that these compaction actions could be triggered from that point, which is outside the Iceberg library\r\n2. would it be okay with the community if we publish a separated open source repository for metrics reporters like this, such that they will be a part of the EMR distribution, and users can plug it into a catalog if necessary.\r\n3. we could also develop a metrics reporter for a specific engine like Spark, and we contact the Spark endpoint to submit such a job instead of doing it through an external service provider's API. Would that be a viable approach?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1483370758/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1483471763","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4280#issuecomment-1483471763","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4280","id":1483471763,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85Ya_uT","user":{"login":"jackye1995","id":29823233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODIzMjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29823233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995","html_url":"https://github.com/jackye1995","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-24T21:57:04Z","updated_at":"2023-03-24T21:57:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"We added one feature for https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/master/aws/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/aws/AwsProperties.java#L652, which should to some extent mitigate the issue.

solution.\r\n\r\nOne of the problems with the proposed approach is that optimizations are being triggered as an immediate result of a commit. The implication is that whatever happens in the metric report consumer needs to happen in a way that doesn't affect the commit path. For example, failures in the consumer should not lead to commit failures. \r\nAdditionally, every single commit triggers additional workload, so I think consuming a metrics report and actually performing some workload should be completely decoupled from one another.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1485260971/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1485448456","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4280#issuecomment-1485448456","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4280","id":1485448456,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85YiiUI","user":{"login":"dacreify","id":53440725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNDQwNzI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53440725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dacreify","html_url":"https://github.com/dacreify","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dacreify/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dacreify/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dacreify/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dacreify/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dacreify/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dacreify/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dacreify/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dacreify/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dacreify/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-27T16:26:09Z","updated_at":"2023-03-27T16:26:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"It looks like a new `FileIO` is being constructed for each write in our case.
