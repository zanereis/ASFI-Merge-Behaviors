This is what I see moving forward.\r\n\r\n- Define the versions of Scala to build against in the `crossScalaVersions` setting.\r\n- I’d be happy if it would be possible to deprecate Spark 1. We keep using the class (especially SQLContext) that keeping for backward compatibility for a while.\r\n- Or the code that depends on version of Spark makes it abstract, and separate build. The jar that depends on Spark 1 is in lib/spark and the other is in lib/extra. In order to use Spark 2, one would replaced like ES5.\r\n\r\nNote that this is just my imagination for now.

We will still require users to build their own package, so cross building everything in one shot would take too much time for them.\r\n\r\nThe goal is mostly about being flexible to use different dependencies instead of enforcing a set. We probably will only officially test Scala 2.10 + Spark 1.6, and Scala 2.11 + Spark 2. I tried other combos but haven't been able to make them work yet.\r\n\r\nAgree the ES dep need to be fixed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/predictionio/issues/comments/287451131/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/predictionio/issues/comments/287696044","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/predictionio/pull/364#issuecomment-287696044","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/predictionio/issues/364","id":287696044,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NzY5NjA0NA==","user":{"login":"shimamoto","id":1875052,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NzUwNTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1875052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shimamoto","html_url":"https://github.com/shimamoto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shimamoto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shimamoto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shimamoto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shimamoto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shimamoto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shimamoto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shimamoto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shimamoto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shimamoto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-20T08:06:25Z","updated_at":"2017-03-20T08:06:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@dszeto I understand your situation.\r\nThis PR is put EoM (Ease of Maintenance) before flexible because this leads to Easy of Extension in future.

So we should lead users to upgrade to maintained versions. At first, we should announce the plan of supported versions and drop old versions after a sufficient transition period. Maybe we should do it after graduation the incubator.
