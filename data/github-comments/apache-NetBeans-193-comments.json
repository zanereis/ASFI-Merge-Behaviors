Note that the rust-analyzer integration in NetBeans needs some prior investigation, we first should decide if a single rust-analyzer instance is good enough for different \"projects\" or if each

We should also decide what a NetBeans Rust Project is (a package, a workspace with many packages?, etc.).

It is a workaround but it could be better without it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1868046228/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1868064261","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/6875#issuecomment-1868064261","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/6875","id":1868064261,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5vWGYF","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-22T20:57:12Z","updated_at":"2023-12-22T20:57:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"What would you suggest?

With Payara, the simplest is to run these 2 commands in asadmin of Payara (replace with your name and password in MySQL; asadmin is a file in the bin directory of the installation directory of Payara; run it) :\r\n\r\n> create-jdbc-connection-pool --datasourceclassname com.mysql.cj.jdbc.MysqlDataSource --restype javax.sql.DataSource --property portNumber=3306:user=****:password=****:databaseName=customer:serverName=localhost:useSSL=false:allowPublicKeyRetrieval=true:driverClass=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver MySQLPool\r\n> create-jdbc-resource --connectionpoolid MySQLPool jdbc/customer\r\n\r\nThe creation of a datasource is not standardized in the application servers. I think that the 2 commands above work with GlassFish too.\r\n\r\n4. Launch the wizard.\r\n\r\n  - Choose the datasource created in step 3 (jdbc/cutomer).\r\n\r\n  - A window \"New Connection Wizard\" appears. [**The problem is that you can't use an already defined connection.** ]\r\n\r\n  - In this window, replace the name of the database with your name (customer for my example). The same for \"User Name\" and \"Password\". Tick \"Remember password\". Click on \"Test Connection\"; the message \"Connection Succeded\" is displayed. Click Next. Click Finish. The tables appear and you can choose the tables used to generate the entities.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that, if latter you want to generate other entities from the same database, you will not be able to use the same connection. When the window \"New Connection Wizard\" will appear, and you click \"Finish\", you will receive the message \"Unable to add connection. Connection already exists\". A workaround: modify the value of \"JDBC URL\" in the window \"New Connection Wizard\", for example by adding a new property at the end. I have tried so many JDBC URL during my tests of the wizard that I can't use this workaround any longer...\r\n\r\nIt would be good if, like in the ancient times, a datasource were enough, without using a connection. But perhaps the person that added the connection had a good reason. \r\n\r\nElse, just after a datasource is choosen, the user should be able to choose among the already created connections. If I remember well, this is how it worked in NetBeans 12.1. *Now the problem is that a new connection is always necessary.*\r\n\r\nI hope my explanations will help you solve the problems with this wizard.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1868861491/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1868863130","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/3962#issuecomment-1868863130","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/3962","id":1868863130,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5vZJaa","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-25T08:48:26Z","updated_at":"2023-12-25T08:48:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@sysmat is there still a compile problem?
