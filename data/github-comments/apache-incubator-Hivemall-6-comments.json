\r\n\r\nThe idea is just accumulating `new_weight` obtained from `optimizer.update()`. Once `miniBatchSize` samples are observed, a mean value of the accumulated `new_weight` will be set to a model via `model.setWeight`.\r\n\r\nFor SGD, it's clearly equivalent to [what RegressorBaseUDTF does](https://github.com/takuti/incubator-hivemall/blob/5dc6f4eb5a8d8532201f6706673e2381d47d7e70/core/src/main/java/hivemall/regression/RegressionBaseUDTF.java#L247-L251). However, I'm a little bit afraid if I can do the same thing for Adagrad, Adam, Adadelta and AdagradRDA. (Currently, doing the same thing for Adagrad, Adam and Adadelta are allowed. By contrast, AdagradRDA + `-mini_batch` option is not supported.)\r\n\r\nBTW, practically, I observed that the naive Adagrad + `-mini_batch` implementation seems to work correctly as shown in the next
