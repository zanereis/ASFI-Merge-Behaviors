The purpose of this stuff is mainly so tasks can be restarted and relaunch without losing all data since the last handoff (they can restore from disk). Since the Committer metadata contains the current state of kafka offsets across _all_ segments, it's important to persist every in-memory IncrementalIndex to disk before writing down the Committer metadata.\r\n\r\nPushing is a bit different, in this case you are pushing segments to deep storage that have already been persisted to disk and finalized. So the Committer metadata is already in sync and there is no reason to push _every_ segment.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/386061665/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/386084318","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/5693#issuecomment-386084318","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/5693","id":386084318,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NjA4NDMxOA==","user":{"login":"kaijianding","id":8663725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NjM3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8663725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijianding","html_url":"https://github.com/kaijianding","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijianding/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijianding/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijianding/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijianding/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijianding/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijianding/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijianding/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijianding/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijianding/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-02T18:57:41Z","updated_at":"2018-05-02T18:57:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jihoonson

Druid HyperLogLogCollector shows significant bias in low counts and a glitch around 5000 counts.\r\n\r\nOur sketch can be configured from k=16 to k=2M, and can merge sketches with different k.\r\n\r\nIf one wants to have a very crude estimate (order-of-magnitude cardinality), our sketch can do this using 48 bytes (k=16).\r\n\r\nBesides, we have Hive and Pig plugins so that sketches can be prepared in batch mode on Hadoop and ingested into Druid.\r\n\r\nI suspect that our HLL sketch is faster, but I didn't do specific time measurements. The accuracy test runs about 8 to 9 times faster, but this only involves HyperLogLogCollector.add() method (no merging).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/387867713/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/387905281","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/5761#issuecomment-387905281","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/5761","id":387905281,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NzkwNTI4MQ==","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-09T23:30:06Z","updated_at":"2018-05-09T23:30:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm working on this and https://github.com/druid-io/druid/issues/5729.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/387905281/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/387913432","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/5765#issuecomment-387913432","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/5765","id":387913432,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NzkxMzQzMg==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-10T00:20:22Z","updated_at":"2018-05-10T00:20:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @michas2, thanks for the contribution!
