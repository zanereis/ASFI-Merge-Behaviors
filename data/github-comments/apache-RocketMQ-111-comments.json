But we could make a discuss if it is worth making this change.\r\n> \r\n> The ByteBuffer used here was from Netty API, and it already had an implementation of autoscaling under it. Whenever the ByteBuf reaches the initialCapacity set by developers, it would start to autoscale by 4MB until maxCapacity (set by devs) or Integer.MAX_VALUE.\r\n> \r\n> Of course, we do not want autoscaling it every time, but if the chance of exceeding the maxMessageBodySize is not that high, I don't see why we need to add another 64KB (from your changes) for ByteBuf.\r\n\r\nYes, using bytebuf can achieve autoscaling, so in the current scenario, no error will be reported. But what I consider is that mq should have its own detection of the encoding length of the message, instead of relying on the self-autoscaling of bytebuf.\r\n\r\nAs for why it is 64kb, I have replied in a previous comment.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1158436344/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1158439979","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/4451#issuecomment-1158439979","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/4451","id":1158439979,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl85FDGQr","user":{"login":"BurningCN","id":43363120,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzYzMTIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43363120?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN","html_url":"https://github.com/BurningCN","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-17T03:04:41Z","updated_at":"2022-06-17T03:04:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"在`rebalance`的时候，`this.lock(mq)`执行之后，`mq`在`broker`是锁定的，但是`processQueue.isLocked`还是`false`，然后接着执行`this.processQueueTable.putIfAbsent(mq,pq);`此时table才有了此entry。\r\n\r\n这样定时任务`ConsumeMessageOrderlyService#lockMQPeriodically`再次执行lock的时候才能拿到processQueue（前面的entry）并置为locked。而`lockMQPeriodically`第一次执行是在1s后","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1158439979/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1158440045","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/4446#issuecomment-1158440045","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/4446","id":1158440045,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl85FDGRt","user":{"login":"dongeforever","id":8434428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MzQ0Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8434428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever","html_url":"https://github.com/dongeforever","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-17T03:04:49Z","updated_at":"2022-06-17T03:04:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@lizhanhui \r\n\r\n1. In the beginning, without the InterceptorAdaptor, the compatibility problem is serious. Currently, it is not so serious. But two Interfaces(RPCHook vs Interceptor) do a similar thing, which is not so good.

It is important to explain how often the flow control is used.  In practice, the flow control is only used on the server-side, and only be used by the advanced developers(usually the service provider), Which means it is used by a very small number of developers.

@lwclover I have read all the code. This solution is simple and useful in some cases.\r\n> \r\n> And the same time, there are two potential problems.\r\n> \r\n> Firstly, in the public cloud or hybrid cloud, with SLB/PrivateLink, the network may be complicated, and we may not able to identify the client/broker by their remote address. So we may need a more common way to identify the client/broker. For example, we could abstract a config named \"site\", and the client/broker inject the \"site\" info to the extFields of RemotingCommand.\r\n> \r\n> Secondly, we may need a way to solve the conflict between consumers of the same group in different networks. For example, some consumers on site A, some consumers on site global.\r\n\r\n@dongeforever Thank you for reviewing my code.\r\nFor your first suggestion, My goal is to be transparent to the client，if I  abstract a config named \"site\", client/broker need config it.\r\n\r\nFor your sencod suggestion,I agree with you. client may abstract a config named \"disabledNearbyRouteWhenTurnedOn=true\".\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1161633919/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1161645892","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/4454#issuecomment-1161645892","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/4454","id":1161645892,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl85FPU9E","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-21T11:54:02Z","updated_at":"2022-06-21T11:54:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\n[![Coverage

a lot. From your description, I think the reason for counting from 1 is like this.\r\nWhen the putKey method is triggered and a slot is hit for the first time, the value of the slot itself is 0. If indexCount counts from 0, when this `this.mappedByteBuffer.getInt(absSlotPos)` returns 0, it is not possible to confirm whether the returned 0 means that [no key has ever landed on the slot] or that [an indexEntry with indexCount=0 has previously landed on the slot].","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1165106301/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1165113924","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/4507#issuecomment-1165113924","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/4507","id":1165113924,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl85FcjpE","user":{"login":"ShannonDing","id":16487356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDg3MzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16487356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShannonDing","html_url":"https://github.com/ShannonDing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShannonDing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShannonDing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShannonDing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShannonDing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShannonDing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShannonDing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShannonDing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShannonDing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShannonDing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-24T02:21:45Z","updated_at":"2022-06-24T02:21:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Welcome to create a PR to fix it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1165113924/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1165308716","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/4500#issuecomment-1165308716","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/4500","id":1165308716,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl85FdTMs","user":{"login":"dongeforever","id":8434428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MzQ0Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8434428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever","html_url":"https://github.com/dongeforever","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-24T07:57:13Z","updated_at":"2022-06-24T07:57:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@lizhanhui  I agree with you, await is better than sleeping.\r\n\r\nThis test is stable on local mac, but it is not stable on the Travis-ci cloud.

Hi, There is no need to do that, lite pull is widely used in the streaming scenario while POP is unsuitable.\r\n> \r\n> For your needs, I think the new SimpleConsumer API is more suitable and could
