If most features of spring should work it's better to use the webflux integration so all features of spring work for free. My understanding when we migrated to pure armeria without using any bridge like tomcat or webflux was that zipkin-server doesn't need to have full support for spring features.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/482419061/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/482424867","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2495#issuecomment-482424867","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2495","id":482424867,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MjQyNDg2Nw==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-12T03:36:51Z","updated_at":"2019-04-12T03:36:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@anuraaga I think case-by-case and would guess that compression enabled might be one of those cases that is likely to be asked elsewhere even if asked here first.

The api is not suited enough to retrofit to things like pagination quickly also. This issue is about preventing crashes so we can keep that in mind.\r\n\r\nthere are three entry points which this limiting concerns:\r\n\r\n* trace list screen (one trace in results could be poison)\r\n* trace by ID and trace by JSON (the only trace loaded could be poison big)\r\n\r\nI can think of some remedies, and we have to remember this is different than the other issue about too big, but not too big to crash.\r\n\r\nI think simple way out would be to just refuse to load when payload is larger than say 5MiB by default, with a setting one can update. I prefer size based as traces can be huge for other reasons not just span count like too many tags or annotations.\r\n\r\nAnother way that comes to mind is look at what tools exist for incremental

of debating which character to use when building index names. What about making it configurable and let the developer choose the index pattern (with sensible defaults). In Logstash you can configure `logstash-%{type}-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}` for instance, it's very convenient, and it can be backward compatible. Even with Elasticsearch 6.x I'd like to drop the colon from index name, in order to ease upgrade to Elasticsearch 7.x.\r\n\r\nAbout index templates, and mappings in particular, instead of trying to build a generic and complicated `VersionSpecificTemplates` class which can handle all versions. What about just having a template file for each version like in Logstash (in https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-elasticsearch/tree/master/lib/logstash/outputs/elasticsearch see elasticsearch-template-*.json).
