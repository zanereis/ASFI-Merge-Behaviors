I think @gerardo mentioned it last time we spoke.  Luckily we did not have breaking changes :)\r\n\r\nThis change fixes it - I am now building the Kubernetes image from locally built image in the host and run `docker save` it to a tar archive which is then mounted to airflow-testing container so that it can be loaded to DinD docker and further loaded to the KinD cluster. \r\n\r\nThe .tar image contains latest sources:\r\n* In CI it is done right after the image is built (so has latest sources by definition).\r\n* In Breeze I ask the user to \"force build\" the image always when the user enters Breeze with `--start-kubernetes-cluster` flag. \r\n\r\nThis way the image with latest sources will be build/saved and made available to airflow-testing container via mounted volume. \r\n\r\n@dimberman - you migth also be interested that I made the development workflow for Kubernetes tests with Breeze as nice as possible (we will later improve it - maybe with the production image). The original \"Kind\" change was working fine for CI (except not taking latest sources), but running it for local development was not really feasible. You really needed to rebuild everything from the scratch when you entered the environment (which took like 10-20 minutes on my PC) and there was no easy way to test the latest sources - short of forwarding, building and pushing your own images to dind container :(. \r\n\r\nI optimised it now so that when you have not closed the Breeze environment it will take far less time:\r\n* kind cluster is not deleted every time - it is reused when you exit/enter Breeze (and do not stop environment)\r\n* if you enter the cluster with --start-kubernetes-cluster, the CI image will be rebuilt taking latest sources, then kubernetes image is build out of it and saved/mounted to airflow-testing container\r\n* If you do not stop the environment, the DiND container is running so it keeps both Kind cluster running as well as the kubernetes images pushed.\r\n* this means that if we rebuild the image with latest sources, only few last layers change and it is much faster to load the image - both to DiND and to Cluster.\r\n* I've done it in the way that if you have enough power/memory, you could run multiple clusters (each for different kubernetes version) and multiple airflows - one for each python version, all in one DiND. That might be useful when we migrate out of Travis.\r\n* still if you stop the environment everything will be deleted and whole setup will be setup from the scratch (which is good for cleanup etc.)\r\n* It should be easy to switch to an external cluster with the current setup in the future.\r\n* I added instructions how to run the Kubernetes tests in Breeze\r\n\r\nIt's not ideal and rather slow, but at least it is automated now and you can run Kubernetes tests with your latest sources rather

Which will basically mean that we will test both the Kubernetes Tests and Production image at the same time (and it will be way smaller so it's likely we will have much faster tests overall  :). Vast majority of the test now is just preparation of the environment and particularly exporting/loading the Airflow images :(. \r\n\r\nWhat do you mean by resetting the cluster ? From what I understand the \"deploy_app.sh\" script will actually delete the pods - postgres/airflow/webserver. This will effectively destroy any state - i.e. the postgres volume, and next time when we redeploy the app we anyhow run \"initContainer\" in the airflow.yaml (airflow-test-env-init.sh) which will perform `airflow initdb`. So I think just making sure that we redeploy the app before rerunning test is enough?\r\n\r\nIf we want to re-run tests, presumably we want to do it because we modified code, so we have to rebuild and re-deploy the application (after building the image) so we should be fine anyway ?\r\n\r\nI just now will have to make an easy way to trigger it for iterative development. \r\n\r\nI think it should be possible to rebuild the image and re-deploy app with a single trigger from the host without even restarting breeze. I will likely have to mount the whole folder rather than single file to let the exported .tar file to be updated in container.

But note that this can end up in an always True loops so make sure that your BranchPythonOperator in Dag 2 has the correct logic.\r\n> \r\n> Hi, @kaxil , instead of `TriggerDagRunOperator`, what do you think about extracting the sub dag `A, C, E, ..., J` and putting them into a `SubDagOperator`? I.e like this:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> A >> C >> E >> G >> H >> I >> J >> K >> L >> M >> Finish\r\n>                ^                   ^          \r\n>                |                   |         \r\n> B >> D >> F>>>>                    |\r\n>                                    |\r\n> Sensor >> SubDag_A_to_J >>>>>>>>>>>\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> where SubDag_A_to_J is a SubDagOperator containing these tasks:\r\n> A >> C >> E >> G >> H >> I >> J\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> The user experience with `SubDagOperator` for this purpose seems great. Users see the rerun abstracted into a node on the main DAG and when they click on the sub dag node it zooms into the sub dag which shows what is being run. And most importantly for us, everything is still tightly linked together on the main DAG. If we need to rerun things historically it works just fine.\r\n> \r\n> However some research shows that the internet suggests not to use `SubDagOperator` because it has some shortcomings, e.g. [this Astronomer page](https://www.astronomer.io/guides/subdags/). The most cited reason is that `SubDagOperator` used to cause deadlock and thus the default executor in Airflow 1.10.* was changed to `SequentialExecutor` which means only one task in the sub dag can run at a time. That is not great. But there are some workaround offered online, such as [this one](https://medium.com/@team_24989/fixing-subdagoperator-deadlock-in-airflow-6c64312ebb10) that uses a dedicated celery queue to fix the deadlock problem and thus can still let the SubDagOperator run tasks in parallel.\r\n> \r\n> And more interestingly, the latest `SubDagOperator` in master branch has been made into a `BaseSensorOperator` in [this change](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5498). The docstr indicates the deadlock issue can be fixed if we set mode to \"reschedule\". It sounds like the performance issue people were complaining about has already been addressed in the latest Airflow although that change was not released in 1.10.6. Is that the case? If that's the case, it sounds like we have to wait a while before we can safely use `SubDagOperator`.\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> Although SubDagOperator can occupy a pool/concurrency slot,\r\n> user can specify the mode=reschedule so that the slot will be\r\n> released periodically to avoid potential deadlock.\r\n> ```\r\n\r\n@yuqian90 Yes if you use pool, SubDagOperator can become problematic. The changes to SubDagOperator may be released in Airflow 2.0","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/549798868/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/549805281","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6374#issuecomment-549805281","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6374","id":549805281,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0OTgwNTI4MQ==","user":{"login":"OmerJog","id":44576851,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NTc2ODUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44576851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmerJog","html_url":"https://github.com/OmerJog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmerJog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmerJog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmerJog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmerJog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmerJog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmerJog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmerJog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmerJog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmerJog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-05T12:37:02Z","updated_at":"2019-11-05T12:37:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ready
