So I have added a new field to PulsarApi.proto and I wanted to generate PulsarApi.java accordingly. However, that was where I ran into some problems since I was unable to perform the second step. I have added a maven ```protobuf``` dependency to pulsar-common/pom.xml, but no generated changes were made to PulsarApi.java (I tried to use the ```protobuf:compile``` goal to generate the PulsarApi.java file). So right now, I probably need some advice on how to generate the PulsarApi.java file.

That might've been the cause of why we are starting to process from my-message-0 despite the seek call. So what I have done is that during the ```subscribe``` command, I match the start publish time with the message id ```startId``` that is the closest to it, and then I will call ```getNonDurableSubscription(MessageId startMessageId)``` to create the subscription where startMessageId equals ```startId```.\r\n\r\nThat is the basic approach that I'm currently doing.

Is that a bad thing? Is there any limitation in this approach?\r\n\r\nIt is not a bad thing. I am actually super happy to see this happen because I am a supporter for broker-side approaches from the beginning (if you have followed the email discussion).\r\n\r\n> The changes to the dispatcher itself have been isolated in a very few specific points. \r\n\r\nIf you took a look at [my comment](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/4062#pullrequestreview-227588319), PIP-26 also isolates the changes to a structure called `DelayedMessageIndex` (which is the structure you called DelayedDeliveryTracker here). So technically there are no fundamental differences between this PR and PIP-26 regarding the concerns around changes touching dispatcher. I am just trying to figure out why and make sure the authors of PIP-26 also understand your thoughts behind this. IMO that is an important thing for building a healthy community.\r\n\r\n> The biggest difference with this PR is that the tracking happens entirely off-heap, in direct memory. There are no objects created and retained for extended amount of time, which is the pattern that will kill the GC performances.\r\n\r\nI don't think the biggest difference with this PR and PIP-26 is the direct memory thing you mentioned on implementing DelayDeliveryTracker. The delayed message index in PIP-26 can also be implemented using direct memory without allocation. \r\n\r\nIMO the difference between this PR and PIP-26 is - `DelayedDeliveryTracker` in this PR is a pure memory structure which can not hold \"delayed index\" beyond memory; `DelayedMessageIndex` in PIP-26 is a time partitioned structure which can spool the index back to ledgers.  `DelayedDeliveryTracker` is limited at the delay ranges that it can support. `DelayedMessageIndex` is a more generic approach on supporting arbitrary delays or scheduled messages. \r\n\r\n`DelayedDeliveryTracker` and `DelayedMessageIndex` are just two different implementations of one same things. If the current implementation of `DelayedDeliveryTracker` is acceptable, why the proposal of a time-partitioned `DelayedMessageIndex` is not acceptable? People can choose which implementation to use by configuring a configuration in the broker configuration.\r\n\r\nLastly, PIP-26 already presents changes regarding api, protocol, namespace policies and many other changes around this area.

If the current implementation of DelayedDeliveryTracker is acceptable, why the proposal of a time-partitioned DelayedMessageIndex is not acceptable? People can choose which implementation to use by configuring a configuration in the broker configuration.\r\n\r\nThat's a very good point. It would be good to have a DelayedDeliveryTracker as an interface and we can have different implementations. \r\n\r\nThat will help: \r\n 1. Accommodate different scenarios\r\n 2. Easily experiment with different implementation approaches \r\n\r\nI'll update this PR to make the interface configurable.\r\n\r\n> Lastly, PIP-26 already presents changes regarding api, protocol, namespace policies and many other changes around this area. Shall we just pickup the proposed changes there instead of starting a new effort?\r\n\r\nIn PIP-26 the proposed API methods were:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n// message to be delivered at the configured delay interval\r\nproducer.newMessage().delayAt(3L, TimeUnit.MINUTE).value(\"Hello Pulsar!\").send();\r\n\r\n// message to be delivered at the configure time.\r\nproducer.newMessage().scheduleAt(new Date(2018, 10, 31, 23, 00, 00))\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this PR I'm proposing: \r\n\r\n```java\r\nproducer.newMessage().deliverAfter(3, TimeUnit.MINUTE).value(\"hello\").send();\r\n\r\nproducer.newMessage().deliverAt(timestamp).value(\"hello\").send();\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy reasons are:\r\n * `delayAt()` seems confusing because \"at\" in all timing APIs is used for absolute positioning\r\n * I'd rather keep the same prefix `deliverAt()` / `deliverAfter` to make it visually clear these are 2 alternative ways to configure the same feature.\r\n * Date vs timestamp. I have no strong opinion there since both are basically interchangeable (eg: `new Date(timestamp)` and `date.getTime()`). I was using a timestamp since that is what we're already using for publishTime and eventTime.\r\n\r\nFor the protobuf metadata change, in PIP-26 was :\r\n\r\n```protobuf\r\n// the message will be delayed at delivery by `delayed_ms` milliseconds.\r\n    optional int64 delayed_ms \t= 18;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThough that won't support specifying absolute time of scheduling scheduling.\r\n\r\nInstead, I propose to start with \r\n```protobuf\r\n// Mark the message to be delivered at or after the specified timestamp\r\noptional uint64 deliver_at_time = 18;\r\n```\r\n\r\nInitially, with relative delays the client will just apply based on its current time. Once we have broker assigned timestamp (stored within the message metadata), then we could add a second field. \r\nAlternatively, we could as well start with 2 fields (abs and relative) and have the broker do the math based on producer assigned publish time.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/484240339/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/484254844","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/4058#issuecomment-484254844","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/4058","id":484254844,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NDI1NDg0NA==","user":{"login":"jerrypeng","id":3613359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTMzNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3613359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng","html_url":"https://github.com/jerrypeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-17T20:46:25Z","updated_at":"2019-04-17T20:46:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"rerun java8 tests\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/484254844/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
