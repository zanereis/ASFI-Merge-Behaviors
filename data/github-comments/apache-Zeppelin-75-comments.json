I think user A would expect to run shell script as himself, but actually it run as user zeppelin. And seems all the users are sharing the same principal if I understand correctly.  Anyway, I don't have a better idea now, but seems zeppelin in secured cluster needs a lot work to do. \n\nBesides that I have one question about shiro of zeppelin, does shiro will map the username to hadoop side ? Say I login zeppelin as user A, would that guaranteed there should also be a user A in the hadoop ecosystem?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/234434182/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/234439914","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1163#issuecomment-234439914","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1163","id":234439914,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNDQzOTkxNA==","user":{"login":"zjffdu","id":164491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu","html_url":"https://github.com/zjffdu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-22T02:37:49Z","updated_at":"2016-07-22T02:37:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sorry, I mistake it as hdfs interpreter.
