@saguziel @mistercrunch \r\n\r\nThis is to explain my perspective and to do a suggestion for a fix that is acceptable, considering your comments. \r\n\r\nAssumptions:\r\n\r\n1.  Backfills either create DagRuns (ie. to fill in a gap between runs) or update DagRuns (ie. partial rerun or fill in a gap in a run)\r\n2. A Backfill DagRun can consist of a subset of tasks from the \"original\" DAG (for lack of a better word). Let's call this a `subset dag_run` for simplicity.\r\n\r\nIssues to resolve:\r\n\r\n1. To create a `subset dag_run` a DAG is created with the same identifier as the original DAG. \r\n2. The integrity of a DagRun is defined by the cohesion of its tasks\r\n3. The state of the DagRun (=SUCCESS, RUNNING) is determined by the state of the tasks in the DagRun\r\n4. A backfill can override a scheduled run (run_id changes)\r\n\r\nSuggested solution:\r\n1. A Backfill will override a scheduled DagRun. As we don't have a proper foreign key relationship between tasks and dag_runs (tasks should be pointing to a unique id, instead of dag_id, execution_date), all tasks in the dag run and \"original\" dag_run will point to the Backfill dag run. Ie. the run_id of the original dag_run will be overwritten.\r\n2. If a `subset dagrun` creates a new DagRun it will only create the tasks that are part of subset dag.\r\n3. DagRun.verify_integrity will only consider tasks that are part of the DAG that is being run, for a `subset dag` this means a subset of tasks. This means it can only add tasks instances to a `subset dagrun`, as it has no way of determining if certain tasks have been removed. If it is not running a subset, it can consider all tasks and mark them `REMOVED` if needed. => this requires the \"original\" dag definition to be present or a `partial` flag. `If self.dag.partial == True: do_no_set_removed`.\r\n4. The state of the DagRun will be determined by the set of tasks of that dag that has run last. Ie. in case of a `subset dag` some tasks could have failed in the original dagRun, but the DagRun can be marked successful.\r\n\r\nConsequences:\r\n1. In the UI DagRuns can be marked successful, while some tasks have been marked failed. This can be resolved when we have a proper foreign key for tasks -> dag runs, allowing versioning of runs.\r\n2. Overriding an in flight scheduled run by a backfill delivers undetermined results (although we have some protections). Resolved when backfills are in the scheduler\r\n3. In case a scheduled DagRun is overridden by a Backfill, you cannot clear the state again to have the tasks scheduled by the scheduler. This wasn't possible anyway in earlier versions of Airflow and remains a limitation for now - or you would have ended up in No. 2 - undetermined results.
