I see in our https://github.com/USCDataScience/dl4j-kerasimport-examples repo you have linked to several models that we could try and use via Keras import here, including an audio one, and the VGG one e.g., https://github.com/apache/tika/pull/159. I think we should - if https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/issues/3375#issuecomment-299707455 works and if we can add support for VGG and the audio model - include tika-dl in 1.15. It would be a HUGE improvement. I think the code we have currently in this PR for Tika-DL though doesn't need to be specific to Inception - it would work the same with the other models - right?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/comments/299715485/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/comments/299719669","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tika/pull/165#issuecomment-299719669","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/165","id":299719669,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5OTcxOTY2OQ==","user":{"login":"thammegowda","id":1865964,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjU5NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1865964?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thammegowda","html_url":"https://github.com/thammegowda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thammegowda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thammegowda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thammegowda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thammegowda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thammegowda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thammegowda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thammegowda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thammegowda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thammegowda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-07T17:04:05Z","updated_at":"2017-05-07T17:04:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@chrismattmann Exactly that's the vision for this module - to take full advantage of all those models in all models in https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-models/tree/8d8f54a9e1482c3642a55a694c2cde8f26562a06 for audio, video, image, text ....\r\n\r\nif we \"get DL4J  and keras model importer into tika's class path\" AND \"make it work ðŸ’¯/ðŸ’¯  on all major platforms like OSX, LINUX and WINDOWS, then we open up huge possibilities of semantic analysis of documents.\r\n\r\nI feel it is very difficult to generalize one parser to work for all those models.

The DL4J guys released a hotfix 0.8.0-2 with the updates they made to stabilize H5 model weights. I ran it 100x it works fine. Tests pass. I'm going to update tika-bundle and include this as a module in tika-parsers and see if that builds fine. If so, imagine, in 1.15, we could have a DL4J REST server (and use in Tika-Python)! awesome (without an external TensorFlow server - which is great/fine, but this reduces complexity). And in 1.16, we have a module to add further recognizers and parsers.
