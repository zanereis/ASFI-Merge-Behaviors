If we change it, that can be done later.\r\n\r\n**For the patch:**\r\nMy interpretation is different (in fact the system property is used before and after patching, just differently):\r\n\r\nIt is visible in the current form of the patch:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-netbeans/blob/master/extexecution.process/external/winp.patch#L23\r\n\r\nFrom my interpretation the patch changes the usage of the `winp.folder.preferred` system property. Before the patch the property changed the `jarFile` variable, afterwards it changes the `dllFile` variable. The patch is sensible, as the location of the extracted dll (this is held in `dllFile`) can so be adjusted through a system property. And this would also explain the memory inflation, if the dll is loaded multiple time with different names.\r\n\r\nThe current winp code shows exactly the fixed behavior.  The source if searched here:\r\nhttps://github.com/kohsuke/winp/blob/master/src/main/java/org/jvnet/winp/Native.java#L163\r\nand the target is determined here:\r\nhttps://github.com/kohsuke/winp/blob/master/src/main/java/org/jvnet/winp/Native.java#L148\r\n\r\nYou can run through the `extractToStaticLocation` method as often, as you want, it will only extract the file once, as the target location is only depended on the passed in URL and that is the URL of the embedded DLL, that does not change at

There also are some corner cases in NB's launcher which are not handled by \"app\" launcher.\r\n For example: \r\n* `HOME` token has different meaning on Windows and *NIX: on Windows, $HOME is replaced by `AppData` or `LocalAppData`; on UNIXes, HOME is ... well ;) home. The \"netbeans\" launcher uses the same (CSIDL_DESKTOP) for both cases.\r\n* `DEFAULT_USERDIR_ROOT` is not procssed by \"app\" launcher, which invokes nbexec.dll without `--default_userdir_root`. This may cause issues if an  upgrade mechanism  similar to NetBeans is used (I do in my app).\r\n* platform cluster can have '''absolute''' path in NB/*NIX, but not in \"app\". But both launchers support absolute paths for platform cluster on Windows.\r\n* \"app\" launcher includes \"platform\" cluster in `--clusters` ? @JaroslavTulach - is it OK ?\r\n\r\nshouldn't we synchronize the launchers a bit ?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/399088163/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/399320614","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/583#issuecomment-399320614","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/583","id":399320614,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5OTMyMDYxNA==","user":{"login":"vieiro","id":564140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NDE0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/564140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro","html_url":"https://github.com/vieiro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-22T04:55:06Z","updated_at":"2018-06-22T04:55:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 for merging too.

The `netbeans` launcher is more advanced, as it was used more extensively - e.g. by a real product. The `app.exe` is just a demo toy, good for starting, but not sufficient for real production. The unsaid assumption was that once people need real launcher, they copy the source code and do what they want. There is however no reason for not enhancing the `nbexec` to work better for both `netbeans` as well as `app.exe` launches.
