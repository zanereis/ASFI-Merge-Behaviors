I was not expecting a hash-table to be so costly. I briefly tested a while ago by using only 1 bucket and somehow hard-coded it so that hash-table look up goes away, but the speed (number of samples per second) is roughly the same. I did not look at the GPU usage though. \n\nOne extra thing to notice is that the current non-bucketing ptb rnn example is not using the high-level `FeedForward` model API. So the slowness might be deeper somewhere maybe in the `FeedForward` model. Either way, it should be good to locate the performance bug.\n\nI will try to look into this by the weekend.

It's only special case. \nAlmost my experiments, the factor_type \"out\" is better performance then \"in\" in Kaiming.\nSo, I would like to be seperated.\n\nBut, I have no problem even though it's
