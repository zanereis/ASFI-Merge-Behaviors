Also, fixed few things found during tests under clustered environment. And changed default initial listing target from 'window' to 'all' to make it behave the same as existing listing does. I hope it's ready to be merged.

Thanks for submitting this. I'm sure @jdye64 appreciates it as well because I know he is busy but wants this feature incorporated. I am a little busy with some other things right now but I will definitely take a look at this. \r\n\r\nA couple quick suggestions I know I will have:\r\n* Some of your files still reference NiFi `1.5.0-SNAPSHOT` or `1.6.0`. Others correctly reference `1.8.0-SNAPSHOT` as the current development version. Please ensure that all development versions are `1.8.0-SNAPSHOT`, and the latest released version at this time is `1.7.1`. \r\n* Some files have the license text block after package declarations, imports, or XML opening tags. In each of these files, it needs to be the very first block of text. You can identify issues by running the maven build with `-Pcontrib-check` and it will highlight these issues for you. This will also run the NiFi checkstyle rules to help identify any code style issues. If you have issues with binary files being caught, you can exclude them in the `pom.xml` (search the project for `<excludes combine.children=\"append\">` in other `pom.xml` files for examples).

Also, since groks can be compound and build on other groks, possibly from other files etc, having to load every grok in every instance of the controller as a dynamic property is going to be very tough for the user.  Many times you don't just need one grok, you need many to build up to that one.

I've just been directly poking a simple unsecured NiFi instance (without a proxy) using `curl`\r\n\r\nI guess I'd expect it to work like `index.jsp`. Consider my simple unsecured NiFi instance with no proxy set up. If I hit `http://hostname/` (without a `/nifi` path), I get a simple page advising I probably meant to add `/nifi` to the end (`index.jsp`). You can see this easily enough with `curl http://hostname/`. Note the stylesheet paths all start with `/nifi/...`.\r\n\r\nIf I add `--header \"X-ProxyContextPath: foo\"` to my `curl` (note that I'm still hitting NiFi directly; there is no actual proxy in place), you'll notice there is *no change* to the stylesheet paths unless I \"whitelist\" the path `foo` in `nifi.properties` at `nifi.web.proxy.context.path`. In that case, we'd see the request response references stylesheet paths starting with `/foo/nifi/...` This is what I'd expect given https://nifi.apache.org/docs/nifi-docs/html/administration-guide.html#proxy_configuration\r\n\r\nI'd expect requests that use `message-page.jsp` to do something similar. I've been using `curl` to `GET /nifi-api/access/oidc/callback` on my unsecured cluster with no proxy in front. It is just an easy way to land at the Message Page and get it to render to test this behavior. I'd expect it to behave as above.\r\n\r\n(I'd embed the full shell text illustrating this but I don't have that available at this moment).\r\n\r\nI poked around this issue a bit earlier today. I *thought* I tried exactly your fix (on top of 1.6.0 stable) and discovered that all message page renders were failing because of `setAttribute(\"contextPath\")` never being called in this case. So no matter whether the header was absent, present and safe, present and whitelisted, or present and unsafe, the requests all failed. \r\n\r\nIt looked to me like we'd need to add something to https://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/46ce7aaa3298fa32d7f0c6beca9d45c5d43d3180/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-framework-bundle/nifi-framework/nifi-web/nifi-web-api/src/main/java/org/apache/nifi/web/api/AccessResource.java#L805 that is similar to https://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/46ce7aaa3298fa32d7f0c6beca9d45c5d43d3180/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-framework-bundle/nifi-framework/nifi-web/nifi-web-error/src/main/java/org/apache/nifi/web/filter/CatchAllFilter.java#L52-L53\r\n\r\nBut I'm not sure.

I would say typically we wouldn't keep the raw message with the parsed one, but you could always have an option to control that if you thought it was necessary. The processor can also have an original relationship as Otto suggested, although at that point the original and parsed data are completely separate.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/406615559/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/406618661","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2820#issuecomment-406618661","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2820","id":406618661,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNjYxODY2MQ==","user":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-20T14:32:29Z","updated_at":"2018-07-20T14:32:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bbende when he says Template he means a json document with schema information","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/406618661/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/406773693","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2820#issuecomment-406773693","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2820","id":406773693,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNjc3MzY5Mw==","user":{"login":"PrashanthVenkatesan","id":5620907,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjA5MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5620907?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrashanthVenkatesan","html_url":"https://github.com/PrashanthVenkatesan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrashanthVenkatesan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrashanthVenkatesan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrashanthVenkatesan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrashanthVenkatesan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrashanthVenkatesan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrashanthVenkatesan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrashanthVenkatesan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrashanthVenkatesan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrashanthVenkatesan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-21T06:10:10Z","updated_at":"2018-07-21T06:10:10Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I think conclusion at this point,\r\n1.
