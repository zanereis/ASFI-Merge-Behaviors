My previous comment was that most of the (built-in) connector implementations are just about transferring bytes data in and out of Pulsar. so if you are using Pulsar's built-in connectors, you don't need to specify those settings. For example, if you connect data from Kafka to Pulsar, it just reads bytes from kafka and write bytes to Pulsar. Pulsar doesn't interpret the data. \r\n\r\nSo it depends on whether you are using Pulsar's built-in connectors and how are those connectors implemented. If you are planning to write own connector with protobuf, then you can write your own SerDe or use Pulsar's protobuf schema. If you can share more details about what you are planning to do, I can have a better idea on how to help you.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/495985476/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/495986238","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/4360#issuecomment-495986238","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/4360","id":495986238,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NTk4NjIzOA==","user":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-26T10:13:49Z","updated_at":"2019-05-26T10:13:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"run
