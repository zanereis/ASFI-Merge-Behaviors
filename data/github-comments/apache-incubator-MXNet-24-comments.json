Some math about the exact operation will be helpful. \n\nIn my understanding, '...Output' are designed to be the output layers of the network, and behave differently at training and predicting. E.g. for `SoftmaxOutput`:\n- At training: first softmax, and then a cross-entropy loss function attached automatically\n- At predicting: softmax only, outputs values in [0,1]\n\nWe see here `SoftmaxOut` is doing softmax as the name suggested, but `LinearRegressionOut` seems do nothing other than the attached L2 loss at the training time of `model.FeedForward`: \n\n``` python\ndata = mx.symbol.Variable('data')\nlabel = mx.symbol.Variable('gt_label')\nlr = mx.symbol.LinearRegressionOutput(data=data,label=label,name='lr')\nc_exec=lr.bind(ctx=mx.cpu(),args={'data':mx.nd.ones((2,3)),'gt_label':mx.nd.ones((2,3))})\nc_exec.forward()\nc_exec.outputs[0].asnumpy() # --> array([[ 1., 1., 1.], [ 1., 1., 1.]], dtype=float32)\nlr.list_arguments()         # --> ['data', 'gt_label']\n```\n\nSome would expect from the name that `LinearRegressionOutput` will insert a linear regression operation (essentially a fully-connected layer), but there isn't. \n\nSimilarly, `LogisticRegressionOutput` is only adding a logistic function 1/(1+exp(-x)): \n\n``` python\nlr = mx.symbol.LogisticRegressionOutput(data=data,label=label,name='lr')\nc_exec=lr.bind(ctx=mx.cpu(),args={'data':mx.nd.ones((2,3)),'gt_label':mx.nd.ones((2,3))})\nc_exec.forward()\nc_exec.outputs[0].asnumpy() # --> array([[ 0.7310586, 0.7310586, 0.7310586], [ 0.7310586, 0.7310586, 0.7310586]], dtype=float32)\nlr.list_arguments()         # --> ['data', 'gt_label']\n```\n\nPlease correct me if I get anything wrong.

that would be nice.

This works:\n\n``` python\nimport mxnet as mx\n\nA = mx.sym.Variable('A')\nB = mx.sym.Variable('B')\n\nY = A * B\n\nmultiply = Y.bind(ctx=mx.cpu(), args={'A': mx.nd.ones(1) * 1, 'B': mx.nd.ones(1) * 2})\n\nmultiply.forward()\n\nprint multiply.outputs[0].asscalar() #2\n\nmultiply = Y.bind(ctx=mx.cpu(), args={'A': mx.nd.ones(1) * 3, 'B': mx.nd.ones(1) * 3})\n\nmultiply.forward()\n\nprint multiply.outputs[0].asscalar() #9\n```\n\nI was expecting a more elegant solution (did I miss something?).
