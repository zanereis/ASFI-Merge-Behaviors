this is definitely a good thing, but it won't help in that case.\r\nLet me expand on this a little bit:\r\nI am using the [sidecar-injector](https://github.com/tumblr/k8s-sidecar-injector/), which requests an injection config using an annotation on pods like this: `\"injector.tumblr.com/request\": \"sidecar-test\"`.\r\nThat way, I can inject e.g. a kerberos sidecar into each pod that's being created by the KubernetesExecutor.\r\nSo I put this into the `airflow.cfg` under the `[kubernetes_annotations]` section: `injector.tumblr.com/request = sidecar-test`. This works just fine.\r\nNow if I want to define this in an environment variable like all the other config options, then it will fail, as `AIRFLOW__KUBERNETES_ANNOTATIONS__INJECTOR.TUMBLR.COM/REQUEST: sidecar-test` is not a valid environment variable (and also not a valid ConfigMap key) because of the `/` it contains.\r\n\r\nThe error message for the Kubernetes deployment (using stable/airflow helm chart) when putting it into the ConfigMap: \r\n> Invalid value: \"AIRFLOW__KUBERNETES_ANNOTATIONS__INJECTOR.TUMBLR.COM/REQUEST\": a valid config key must consist of alphanumeric characters, '-', '_' or '.' (e.g. 'key.name',  or 'KEY_NAME',  or 'key-name', regex used for validation is '[-._a-zA-Z0-9]+')\r\n\r\nAnd when putting it directly into an env var:\r\n> Invalid value: \"AIRFLOW__KUBERNETES_ANNOTATIONS__INJECTOR.TUMBLR.COM/REQUEST\": a valid environment variable name must consist of alphabetic characters, digits, '_', '-', or '.', and must not start with a digit (e.g. 'my.env-name',  or 'MY_ENV.NAME',  or 'MyEnvName1', regex used for validation is '[-._a-zA-Z][-._a-zA-Z0-9]*')\r\n\r\nMaybe there's room for a char-sequence substitution? As the `/` in annotations is a very common thing?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/468574296/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/468576600","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4589#issuecomment-468576600","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4589","id":468576600,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2ODU3NjYwMA==","user":{"login":"feng-tao","id":3223098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjMwOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3223098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao","html_url":"https://github.com/feng-tao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-01T07:54:56Z","updated_at":"2019-03-01T07:55:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"got

Just to be clear, what I am proposing is that if the current dag_id label is `> 63` characters long, you slugify by truncating to `n` characters and add a `m` characters-long hash of the extra characters at the end of the slug to guarantee uniqueness, where `n + m + 1 <= 63` (with +1 to account for some separator between the truncated name part and the hash part of the slug). So you would end up with slugs that look like `dagidtaskid-hash` instead of just `hash`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/468655135/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/468662705","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4807#issuecomment-468662705","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4807","id":468662705,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2ODY2MjcwNQ==","user":{"login":"fenglu-db","id":24922485,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTIyNDg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24922485?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenglu-db","html_url":"https://github.com/fenglu-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenglu-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenglu-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenglu-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenglu-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenglu-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenglu-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenglu-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenglu-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenglu-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-01T13:21:35Z","updated_at":"2019-03-01T13:21:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@PaulW I made a similar PR a few days back, how about we consolidate and move the discussion to https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4769?

These labels are the truncated/modified ones.\r\n\r\n`KubernetesExecutor.sync()` resumes, and calls `KubernetesExecutor._change_state()` and passes `key` through to it.\r\n\r\n`_change_state` then deletes the pod which ran the dag/task, and using the `dag_id` and `task_id` values returned previously from `_labels_to_key()` and stored within `key`, then tries to query the db.\r\n\r\n```         (dag_id, task_id, ex_time, try_number) = key\r\n         with create_session() as session:\r\n             item = session.query(TaskInstance).filter_by(\r\n                 dag_id=dag_id,\r\n                 task_id=task_id,\r\n                 execution_date=ex_time\r\n             ).one()\r\n             if state:\r\n                 item.state = state\r\n                 session.add(item)\r\n```\r\n\r\nObviously though this fails, as the `dag_id` and `task_id` stored in the key which is used here is wrong, and doesn't match anything in the DB directly.  This was why we ended up storing the raw values as annotations & referenced them instead.\r\n\r\nI'm currently testing these changes now which remove the need for annotations & keep everything in the labels.  The only file edited now is the `contrib/executors/kubernetes_executor.py`.\r\n\r\nInstead of storing annotations, the `dag_id` and `task_id` are modified to remove any chars which are not supported in label values, and if the value is then greater than 63 chars, it is trimmed & a unique hash created from the 'raw' unmodified value is added to the end.  The `_labels_to_key` function then, instead of returning the `dag_id` and `task_id` directly from the label (which would result in the condition above) instead performs a search of TaskInstances, which filters by the `execution_time` value stored as a 3rd label, loops through the results & matches the task by comparing the 'safe' `dag_id` and `task_id`.  This works fine locally (so far) however, I've some concerns this isn't really 100% foolproof, and that if the updated 'safe' label value differs from the original in any way, should be hashed regardless of length in that respect to avoid mismatched tasks if 2 dag or task names differs purely by a char which is filtered out.\r\n\r\nI'll upload the changes once I've done some more
