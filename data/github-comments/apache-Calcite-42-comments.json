I took a first pass of #2367 , and it seems to be able to resolve the problem of metadata regeneration?\r\n\r\nCurrently, Calcite assumes that all custom rel nodes are registered with the JaninoRelMetadataProvider so the handlers do not have to be regenerated.  That is the API for calcites metadata.  You want to either add check, or generate code at compile time to ensure this is the case.  The above changes allows you to do either in your own code base with out having to justify why.  Maybe it should be changed in calcite main too, but as this PR is almost a year old, I am not sure it worth the effort.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/802385707/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/803496944","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/2373#issuecomment-803496944","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/2373","id":803496944,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwMzQ5Njk0NA==","user":{"login":"xy2953396112","id":23030751,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDMwNzUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23030751?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xy2953396112","html_url":"https://github.com/xy2953396112","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xy2953396112/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xy2953396112/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xy2953396112/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xy2953396112/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xy2953396112/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xy2953396112/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xy2953396112/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xy2953396112/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xy2953396112/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-21T01:35:23Z","updated_at":"2021-03-21T01:35:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vlsi\r\nPlease

The filter is checked in a loop for correlation ID to handle multiple subqueries.  Right and full outer joins are not rewritten because they would logically be incorrect.  Shifter, a util class in RelBuilder, was moved to RelOptUtil so the existing logic could be used in SubQueryRemoveRule.  RelBuilder also now only considers a join correlated if an ID is provided and actually referenced is found on the right side to the ID.
