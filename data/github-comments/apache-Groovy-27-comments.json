It would break code like the following (for the `peek()` case) which while not currently fully checked correctly is what we want to eventually aim for I would think:\r\n```\r\n@groovy.transform.TypeChecked\r\ndef method() {\r\n    def component = new Random().nextBoolean() ? new ArrayDeque() : new Stack()\r\n    component.clear() // 'clear' in LUB (AbstractCollection or Serializable or Cloneable)\r\n    if (component instanceof ArrayDeque) {\r\n        component.addFirst(1) // 'addFirst' only in ArrayDeque\r\n    } else if (component instanceof Stack) {\r\n        component.addElement(2) // 'addElement' only in Stack\r\n    }\r\n    if (component instanceof ArrayDeque || component instanceof Stack) {\r\n        // checked duck typing\r\n        assert component.peek() in 1..2 // 'peek' in ArrayDeque and Stack but not LUB\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nmethod()\r\n```\r\nThe above fails (randomly at runtime with a CastClassException) when using `@CompileStatic` instead of `@TypeChecked` but that is something we should fix in our bytecode generation. While not what we like to aim for, I think we should generate hidden instanceof checks here.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, we can improve how things are handled. We should have the concept of bottom in our type system and an arbitrary expression would yield that and then don't collect types for OR in that scenario. Then we could work on making the type checker smarter to be able to potentially handle expressions like `def isString = value.class == String` as in the test case here so that some expressions might not yield bottom. We also need both union types and intersection types represented (though I agree that those names aren't necessarily the best to use).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/639957966/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/640063588","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/1269#issuecomment-640063588","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/1269","id":640063588,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MDA2MzU4OA==","user":{"login":"eric-milles","id":18193802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTkzODAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18193802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-milles","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-milles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-milles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-milles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-milles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-milles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-milles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-milles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-milles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-milles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-milles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-06T13:44:57Z","updated_at":"2020-06-06T13:46:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Is there a test case or open ticket for your example of ArrayDeque (aka Deque, aka Queue) and Stack?

users.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/643707171/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/643976569","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/1277#issuecomment-643976569","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/1277","id":643976569,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0Mzk3NjU2OQ==","user":{"login":"paulk-asert","id":280016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MDAxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/280016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert","html_url":"https://github.com/paulk-asert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-15T08:15:07Z","updated_at":"2020-06-15T08:15:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merged,

A logical OR with instanceof on both sides for example should have different semantics to a logical AND with instanceof on both sides. And we'd need a NotType as well at some point to have better handling of not in combination with instanceof for nested cases. I can get specific parts of our type checking processing to work as I'd hope with these in place but there are numerous places in the code which make different assumptions to what the new types would need. There are places where we ignore Object for instance which isn't what we'd now need but just removing the places where we make such tests breaks other things because various assumptions flow to other parts of the code.\r\n\r\nSo, as an intermediate step, I have a slightly improved mechanism that looks for any IfStatement where the test is a binary logical OR and treats that as two individual IfStatement's corresponding to each half of the OR. It then does a separate pass to get the UnionType we currently expect for the AND case. The UnionType needs to be catered for so that we have an invokeDynamic instruction produced when @CS is in place. I think it will be a few more days before I have anything ready for review.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/647243171/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/647875803","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/1288#issuecomment-647875803","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/1288","id":647875803,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0Nzg3NTgwMw==","user":{"login":"paulk-asert","id":280016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MDAxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/280016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert","html_url":"https://github.com/paulk-asert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-23T02:54:03Z","updated_at":"2020-06-23T02:54:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merged, thanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/647875803/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/648085934","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/1280#issuecomment-648085934","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/1280","id":648085934,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0ODA4NTkzNA==","user":{"login":"paulk-asert","id":280016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MDAxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/280016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert","html_url":"https://github.com/paulk-asert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-23T11:27:58Z","updated_at":"2020-06-23T11:27:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merged, thanks.
