\r\nAs per dataset documentation I need to convert above data to below format to plot in line chart for different products with time on x axis\r\ndataset = {\r\ndimensions: ['date', 'p1Value', 'p2Value', 'p3Value']\r\n[\r\n{date: \"2019-05-21 00:00:00 UTC\", p1Value: 100, p2Value: 50},\r\n{date: \"2019-05-19 00:00:00 UTC\", p3Value: 200},\r\n{date: \"2019-05-18 00:00:00 UTC\", p1value: 70, p2Value: 125, p3Value: 55}\r\n]\r\n}\r\n\r\nBut problem is data is dynamic and there might not be value for all products at particular time (19th only p3 has data). So for such nodes tooltip is showing remaining values as empty. Ideally it should not show empty values if there is no point on line chart.\r\nEx: If p3Value is turned off from legend and there is no point on remaining lines at 2019-05-19. But by hovering it is showing tooltip at 2019-05-19 with empty values.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/500550437/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/500571972","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/3899#issuecomment-500571972","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/3899","id":500571972,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMDU3MTk3Mg==","user":{"login":"chfw","id":4280312,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODAzMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4280312?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chfw","html_url":"https://github.com/chfw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chfw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chfw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chfw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chfw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chfw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chfw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chfw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chfw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chfw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-10T20:00:01Z","updated_at":"2019-06-10T20:00:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@liiiku,

As ECharts's user base has grown, we are getting more and more usage questions, bug reports, feature requests and pull requests every single day.\n\nAs a free and open source project, ECharts also has limited maintainer bandwidth. That means the only way to ensure the project's sustainability is to:\n\n1. Prioritize more concrete work (bug fixes and new features);\n2. Improve issue triaging efficiency.\n\nFor (1), we have decided to use the GitHub issue lists exclusively for work that has well-defined, actionable goals. Questions and open ended discussions should be posted to mediums that are better suited for them.\n\nFor (2), we have found that issues that do not provide proper information upfront usually results in terribly inefficient back-and-forth communication just to extract the basic information needed for actual triaging. This is exactly why we have created this app: to ensure that every issue is created with the necessary information, and to save time on both sides.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/500666819/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/500666889","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/10642#issuecomment-500666889","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/10642","id":500666889,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMDY2Njg4OQ==","user":{"login":"Ovilia","id":779050,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3OTA1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/779050?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ovilia","html_url":"https://github.com/Ovilia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ovilia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ovilia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ovilia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ovilia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ovilia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ovilia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ovilia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ovilia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ovilia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-11T02:51:45Z","updated_at":"2019-06-11T02:51:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"可以参考 https://echarts.apache.org/examples/zh/editor.html?c=bar-histogram 需要自己写一种自定义系列","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/500666889/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/500667087","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/10645#issuecomment-500667087","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/10645","id":500667087,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMDY2NzA4Nw==","user":{"login":"Ovilia","id":779050,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3OTA1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/779050?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ovilia","html_url":"https://github.com/Ovilia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ovilia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ovilia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ovilia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ovilia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ovilia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ovilia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ovilia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ovilia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ovilia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-11T02:52:41Z","updated_at":"2019-06-11T02:52:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"谢谢反馈，目前大部分功能已恢复，只有截图还在修复中。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/500667087/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/500670277","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/10643#issuecomment-500670277","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/10643","id":500670277,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMDY3MDI3Nw==","user":{"login":"Ovilia","id":779050,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3OTA1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/779050?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ovilia","html_url":"https://github.com/Ovilia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ovilia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ovilia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ovilia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ovilia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ovilia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ovilia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ovilia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ovilia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ovilia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-11T03:11:20Z","updated_at":"2019-06-11T03:11:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Currently, I believe this is not possible with ECharts.
