If I understand correctly browser tests run in PhantomJS, which is basically some version of WebKit, which is ECMA5 js environment - not that the new code assumes ECMA5, but if concern is about js versions compatibility then \"browser\" tests don't really give a lot of extra assurances compared to tests under node.

Is it more the Thrift style to add another type constant to TTransportException and not subclass? That way a user has to catch TTransportException and then switch on type.\n\nI think users may want to handle this exception differently because it can mean that the client has a misconfigured frame size or is requesting too much data.\n\nLooking at some of the other clients (for example: https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/lib/csharp/src/Transport/TFramedTransport.cs) they don't seem to even enforce that the frame size is valid. But I think they could all be updated to both validate the frame size and properly close the transport when they read an invalid one.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/110194778/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/111205380","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/517#issuecomment-111205380","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/517","id":111205380,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExMTIwNTM4MA==","user":{"login":"prashantv","id":140159,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDE1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/140159?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashantv","html_url":"https://github.com/prashantv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashantv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashantv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashantv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashantv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashantv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashantv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashantv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashantv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashantv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-11T16:53:07Z","updated_at":"2015-06-11T16:53:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@i Just started a PR for the same issue, didn't see your fix.\nI think it's better to not set p.Response, since it affects other code (IsOpen returns true, Read will allow reading bytes which most likely won't match the protocol, etc).
