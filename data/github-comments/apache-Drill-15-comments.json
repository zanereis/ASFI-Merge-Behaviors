The golden copy is just one implementation in the current code; people may change the implementation in the future, and it's likely these new testcases will fail. The person to make the change in the future will have to deal with the overhead.\r\n\r\nThe question is what benefit we get from enforcing such \"golden\" copy in the testcases.

The \"loop\" is actually closed as part of \r\n[BasicServer#close](https://github.com/apache/drill/blob/master/exec/rpc/src/main/java/org/apache/drill/exec/rpc/BasicServer.java#L218). But it will be closed multiple times (because there may be multiple instances of sub-classes of BasicServer, and all use the same loop), and looks like \"loop2\" is not closed anywhere. The changes in PR 429 close the loops exactly once, but I do not recollect why the PR is not merged.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/270200219/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/270444750","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/719#issuecomment-270444750","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/719","id":270444750,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MDQ0NDc1MA==","user":{"login":"sudheeshkatkam","id":3272600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNzI2MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3272600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam","html_url":"https://github.com/sudheeshkatkam","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-04T18:19:19Z","updated_at":"2017-01-04T18:19:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1, pending minor comment","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/270444750/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/270445625","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/718#issuecomment-270445625","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/718","id":270445625,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MDQ0NTYyNQ==","user":{"login":"amansinha100","id":6034475,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMzQ0NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6034475?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100","html_url":"https://github.com/amansinha100","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-04T18:22:43Z","updated_at":"2017-01-04T18:22:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I suppose we need more time to investigate why the combination of DRILL-4831 plus DRILL-5082 fixes causes couple of other issues to show up at high concurrency.

Wasn't the design supposed to be that the lazy lookup would check for the function both in planning (\"Calcite\") and execution times? The whole point of the lazy init was to avoid per-query syncs (which will be prohibitively expensive for short queries) and to avoid race conditions.\r\n\r\nI wonder, is the problem the *way* in which we are checking for functions? The issue in this particular JIRA is a function with the same name as an existing function, but with different signature. Did the original lazy init check only names? Could a fix be to check name & signature?\r\n\r\nIn general, the question is, can lazy init be preserved, but enhanced to handle the case described in the bug? It seems a shame to move away from it after all the effort that went into getting it (almost) right...\r\n\r\nIf we switch to relying on syncing, we've got to rethink all the race conditions that were meant to be resolved with lazy init. Seems we'd have to update the design doc. to match. I'd really like to see if we can provide a fix that preserves the lazy init design so we keep the performance & concurrency benefits that it provides.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/270773370/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/270889746","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/716#issuecomment-270889746","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/716","id":270889746,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MDg4OTc0Ng==","user":{"login":"arina-ielchiieva","id":15086720,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDg2NzIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15086720?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva","html_url":"https://github.com/arina-ielchiieva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-06T11:54:05Z","updated_at":"2017-01-06T11:54:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Looks good.
