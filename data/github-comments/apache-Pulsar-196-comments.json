This should have been written up as a PIP and discussed.  I think an issue and PR is not the right approach to make this change. Specifically i would like to see it spelled  out, how the broker ceases topic activity,  in the window between expiry of timeout and recreation of the session. Especially there should  be a verifiable assertion that write ordering on a topic is not broken by this change.\r\n\r\n2)For backward compatibility, there should be  an option to completely turn this off ( retries = 0), and it be the default. \r\n\r\n3)The desirable outcome of this change ...\"Theoretically, the mechanism can guarantee that the ownership of most bundles will not change during the session timeout. \"  ..seems possible only in situations where bundle/topic ownership changes are slow.  This change will benefit a particular use where topic activity is slow. This change is not desirable for fast responsive systems, where if a broker is unresponsive ( long JVM GC pause etc), the desired behaviour is for the broker to shutdown, so that a quick failover of the bundle is triggered by the next lookup.  \r\n\r\n4)The other issues mentioned  (JVM GC, ZookeeperCacheLoader etc) are problems that need addressing, but this fix is not the solution to them.

Now when we have multiple producer deduplication, all messages need to be considered potential dupes, from the point of view of the pulsar clients that talk to broker. I haven't looked at all related code on the broker side yet, but do you as the dedupe expert have an opinion about what to do with message batching in the case of multi-broker deduplication?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/588468969/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/588522396","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/6348#issuecomment-588522396","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/6348","id":588522396,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4ODUyMjM5Ng==","user":{"login":"nlu90","id":16407807,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDA3ODA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16407807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlu90","html_url":"https://github.com/nlu90","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlu90/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlu90/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlu90/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlu90/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlu90/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlu90/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlu90/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlu90/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlu90/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-19T23:11:28Z","updated_at":"2020-02-19T23:11:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@KannarFr Now no actual variable value will be logged into files.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/588522396/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/588522593","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/6348#issuecomment-588522593","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/6348","id":588522593,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4ODUyMjU5Mw==","user":{"login":"KannarFr","id":7518245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MTgyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7518245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KannarFr","html_url":"https://github.com/KannarFr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KannarFr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KannarFr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KannarFr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KannarFr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KannarFr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KannarFr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KannarFr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KannarFr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KannarFr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-19T23:12:06Z","updated_at":"2020-02-19T23:12:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@nlu90 Perfect!
