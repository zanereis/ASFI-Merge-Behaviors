I have a few questions regarding your comments.\r\n\r\n>In Kafka, offset scope itself is per partition. I am unable to find any use case, where we can take the range of offsets and apply on all partitions. In most of the scenario's they may not be valid offsets.\r\n>IMHO, we should only apply predicate pushdown where we have exact scan specs.\r\n\r\n1. Take this query for example\r\n```\r\nSELECT * FROM kafka.LogEventStream WHERE kafkaMsgOffset >= 1000 AND kafkaMsgOffset < 2000)\r\n```\r\n\r\nDid you mean that we do not apply predicate pushdown for such conditions? If we do not pushdown, all partitions will be scanned from `startOffset` to `endOffset`. Instead, by supporting pushdown for such queries, we are limiting the scan range wherever possible. Are there any drawbacks of applying pushdown on such conditions?\r\n\r\nAlso, pushdown implementation handles cases where specified offsets are invalid.\r\n\r\n2. Can you elaborate more on this?\r\n> we can use this predicate pushdown feature for external checkpointing mechanism.\r\n\r\n3. \r\n>And coming to time stamps, my point is, in case of invalid partitionId, query might block indefinitely with this feature. Where as, without this feature, we will return empty results.\r\n\r\nEven with pushdown we will return empty results. Pushdown is applied to each of the predicates independently and merged. The implementation is such that it ensures `offsetsForTimes` is called only for valid partitions (i.e., partitions returned by `partitionsFor`). Hence we will not run into the situation where `offsetsForTimes` blocks infinitely.\r\n\r\nI will add test case for this situation.

So, in such cases where offset predicates without partitionId can be ignored and let it be full scan as these are in valid queries in kafka perspective. Please let me know your thoughts.\r\n\r\n>> If we do not pushdown, all partitions will be scanned from startOffset to endOffset.\r\n\r\nYes, but actually this kind queries itself are in valid except for topics with one partition.

Only use case which i can see , for offset based predicates will be for checkpointing and all the check pointing strategies used in various systems like Storm/Spark streaming/Camus etc will be checkpointing on offset per partition. \r\n\r\n\r\n>> Even with pushdown we will return empty results.

IMO the users who is applying these predicates on offsets, should be aware of offset scope per partition. So, in such cases where offset predicates without partitionId can be ignored and let it be full scan as these are in valid queries in kafka perspective. Please let me know your thoughts.\r\n\r\nThanks @akumarb2010 for clarifying. I agree with you that it is uncommon for user to specify conditions on `offsets` alone but DRILL will support such queries and will return messages that satisfy the condition (across all partitions). \r\n\r\nMy opinion on this is that pushdown for such queries is OKAY and change to NOT pushdown may not be required for the following reasons -\r\n\r\n1. Changes to NOT pushdown would require a LOT more effort and would add a lot more complexity to the code while providing the same result to the user.\r\n\r\nCurrent implementation of pushdown is such that, when parsing the condition tree, a scan spec is generated for each predicate independently and then merged based on how different predicates are joined. \r\nFor example `kafkaMsgOffset > 1000 AND kafkaPartitionId > 3` would create a scan spec (collection of `KafkaPartitionScanSpec`for each partition) for each of the predicates independently and scan spec is later merged based on `AND` condition.\r\nWith this implementation, creation of scan spec for `kafkaMsgOffset` does not have to know whether `kafkaPartitionId` is specified and the same applies to `kafkaPartitionId`. \r\n\r\n>These are not drawbacks, but my point is let's not handle this invalid queries.\r\n\r\n2. DRILL supports such queries (though it may not make complete sense in Kafka world) and applying pushdown for such queries does not have any drawback.\r\n\r\n3. Such queries may be common during Data Exploration phase. For example, user would want to see the first few messages produced to a topic (user may not know how the messages were distributed across partitions during produce).\r\n\r\nFor the sake of code simplicity and no user impact in terms of functionality (just better performance) I am leaning towards applying pushdown uniformly across partitions if `kafkaPartitionId` is not specified.\r\n\r\nLet me know your thoughts.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/392181900/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/392204078","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1272#issuecomment-392204078","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1272","id":392204078,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MjIwNDA3OA==","user":{"login":"kkhatua","id":4335237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4335237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua","html_url":"https://github.com/kkhatua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-25T22:32:06Z","updated_at":"2018-05-25T22:32:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@akumarb2010  I haven't gone through @aravi5 's PR in detail, but I did see an interactive demo where we tried out quite a few of the scenarios. \r\nSemantically, it might not make much sense define offsets without specifying partitions, but it doesn't hurt to have the capability.

Nor are any of the other classes in the call stack.\r\n\r\nThe test is in an HBase test, which is a bit hard to set up. As you know, it is not possible to run functional tests outside of MapR -- which is why only MapR folks can do the actual commits.\r\n\r\nThe failure occurs inside the partitioned sender, generated code, when attempting to clone a `MaterializedField` for a Map.\r\n\r\nLooking at the code, the only way the `MaterializedField.clone()` method can fail is if another thread is adding/removing members to the map while the thread that failed is attempting to clone the map schema. I'm not familiar enough with the partioned sender to track down the issue.\r\n\r\nLooking at history, it appears we modified the partition sender back in April. I wonder if that triggered this failure? Can someone who knows more about that class check if there is some way that the same `MaterializedField` is being used across threads, and mutated in one of them?\r\n\r\nOtherwise, this may be a race condition; try running the test again and the problem may go away.

If you can explain how to reproduce the issue without using the full functional tests, I can take a look.\r\n\r\nIn case it leads to anything... Earlier changes around `MaterializedField` did try to keep the various views of data in sync. The map's `MaterializedField` is supposed to contain, as children, all the map members. This means that changes to any map field requires a matching change to the children. This didn't always happen, leading to bugs that earlier PRs attempted to fix. Not sure if that has an impact here.\r\n\r\nThe other question is whether the partition sender is the only code that calls the `clone()` method. Do we have unit tests for that method?\r\n\r\nIs there some interaction in cloning that reaches back into the original child list? A quick scan of the code didn't suggest any, which is why I wonder if the change occurs in another thread; perhaps triggered as a result of recent fixes in the partitioned sender.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know what you find, then I'd be happy to fix it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/392947880/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/392971014","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1281#issuecomment-392971014","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1281","id":392971014,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5Mjk3MTAxNA==","user":{"login":"dvjyothsna","id":10828072,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODI4MDcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10828072?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dvjyothsna","html_url":"https://github.com/dvjyothsna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dvjyothsna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dvjyothsna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dvjyothsna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dvjyothsna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dvjyothsna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dvjyothsna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dvjyothsna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dvjyothsna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dvjyothsna/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-29T22:41:15Z","updated_at":"2018-05-29T22:41:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ilooner I have addressed all the review comments.

After a month of work I was not able to bring even a simple change like this to a state where it would not OOM. Others experience similar frustrations when they make changes that either impact the HashAgg operator directly, or indirectly. Considering the fact that a comprehensive and stable memory calculator was created for HashJoin in less than a month, I feel that there is an easier way forward.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this experience I was motivated to create https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DRILL-6253 which focuses on refactoring and unit testing the memory calculations for HashAgg . DRILL-6253 will fulfill the original intention of this PR, which was to make the memory calculations more accurate, and also improve the general stability and testability of HashAgg. As a result of this, I am going to abandon this PR and all future work will be done on the PR for DRILL-6253 once it is opened.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/393694572/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/393709996","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/81#issuecomment-393709996","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/81","id":393709996,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MzcwOTk5Ng==","user":{"login":"ilooner","id":8020165,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMjAxNjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8020165?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner","html_url":"https://github.com/ilooner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-31T23:06:01Z","updated_at":"2018-05-31T23:06:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This commit was merged as part of this PR https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/134.

It is not clear why Hive changes the default file system, though we can speculate. Drill likely uses Hive as a metastore. (Later versions of Hive split out the metastore into Hive Meta Store or HMS, so, ideally, that's what Drill would call it...)\r\n\r\nt is unfortunate that Drill requires users to copy their Hive config from a file into a Drill JSON config object. Two copies, in two formats, is typically frowned upon.\r\n\r\nSo, we have HMS, describing data on disk. Presumably HMS wants to state the file system that contains the file, and does so as part of its config. \r\n\r\nNow, we want readers to read those files. One would expect that the \"hive\" storage plugin replace Drill's format plugin mechanisms with its own file-to-format mapping. When reading HMS files, Drill would use the \"hive\" options and formats. Is that how it works? Not sure.\r\n\r\nI believe that \"hive\" has its own set of readers. I've seen indications that one cannot, say, use the Drill native CSV or Parquet readers (say) for \"hive\" files. The question is, how is all this wired together. (I don't know, haven't looked at this code.)\r\n\r\nSupposedly, if we query a \"hive\" table, we need to use the \"hive\" file system info.\r\n\r\nWhere does this \"hive\" info leak into a non-\"hive\" reader? Perhaps joining a \"hive\" file with a \"dfs\" file?\r\n\r\nWith this fix, would that join work?\r\n\r\nIn short, I think we need to understand the above to ensure we don't actually play Whack-a-Mole and introduce a new bug by fixing another.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/393726044/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/393934140","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1298#issuecomment-393934140","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1298","id":393934140,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MzkzNDE0MA==","user":{"login":"priteshm","id":1015719,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTU3MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1015719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshm","html_url":"https://github.com/priteshm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-01T16:25:52Z","updated_at":"2018-06-01T16:25:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@arina-ielchiieva, @vdiravka could one of you guys please review this?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/393934140/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/393949644","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1300#issuecomment-393949644","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1300","id":393949644,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5Mzk0OTY0NA==","user":{"login":"kkhatua","id":4335237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4335237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua","html_url":"https://github.com/kkhatua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-01T17:22:19Z","updated_at":"2018-06-01T17:22:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@kr-arjun thanks for the PR.
