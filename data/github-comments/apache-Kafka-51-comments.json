Just like the producer callbacks in those tests, you can't actually rely on an exact number because the polling is happening in another thread.\n\nThis fix adjusts the tests so the producer callbacks and subsequent `SourceTask.commitRecord` calls are handled in the same way. Ideally we'd also be able to check that they were invoked the same number of times. The errors seem to currently be masked because exceptions about incorrect mock method calls were getting eaten up by the WorkerSourceTask thread, and not reported to the main test thread.\n\nLonger term, it probably makes more sense to try to test each of the threads independently so we don't run into these issues, but this should correct the immediate issue for tests.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/197170538/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/197179531","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1055#issuecomment-197179531","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1055","id":197179531,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5NzE3OTUzMQ==","user":{"login":"hachikuji","id":12502538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAyNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12502538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji","html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-16T06:44:33Z","updated_at":"2016-03-16T06:44:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@drausin Thanks for the update!

The paused state is an instance of a connector \"target state,\" which is stored in the config storage topic. the main reason to have it there is that it opens the door to considering the pause state when determining the task assignments for the workers (e.g. the leader can choose _not_ to assign any paused connectors). However, at the moment, pausing the connector does not cause a rebalance. Instead, each worker reads from the config topic independently. When a target state change is observed by a worker, it pauses or resumes all tasks for that connector which it owns (if there are any). Since a connector's configuration may have changed while it was paused, we always check whether a rebalance is needed after resuming.\n\nAt the moment, there are only two implemented target states: \"started\" and \"paused.\" When a connector is first configured, it is in the \"started\" state regardless whether any target states have been written to the config topic. As state changes occur, the new state is written to the topic. When a connector is deleted, we write null for the value to ensure cleanup.\n\nPause Behavior: the meaning of \"pause\" depends on the type of task:\n- Connector: pause means calling stop() on the connector.\n- Source task: pause means we stop calling task.poll() for new data. \n- Sink task: all assigned partitions are paused using KafkaConsumer.pause(). Significantly, the worker stays part of the consumer group.\n\nAdditional notes: I did some minor refactors here and there, but the most significant one was extracting an interface from KafkaConfigStorage and updating StandaloneHerder to use an in-memory implementation of it. This was a bit awkward since KafkaConfigStorage was designed around a snapshot which is recomputed on config updates, but hopefully it will allow us to move more common functionality into AbstractHerder down the road.\n\nKnown Gaps: the main gap that comes to mind is additional unit/integration tests for the Herder implementations. Probably documentation also. It would be nice if you could point out places where additional docs/comments are needed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/197697665/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/197701972","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1055#issuecomment-197701972","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1055","id":197701972,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5NzcwMTk3Mg==","user":{"login":"hachikuji","id":12502538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAyNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12502538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji","html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-17T04:54:29Z","updated_at":"2016-03-17T04:54:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/197701972/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/197732368","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/964#issuecomment-197732368","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/964","id":197732368,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5NzczMjM2OA==","user":{"login":"ewencp","id":47366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp","html_url":"https://github.com/ewencp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-17T06:54:00Z","updated_at":"2016-03-17T06:54:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Ishiihara Really close to LGTM now.

Actually what I meant was that the callbacks can be fired out of order even for messages sent to the same partitions. This is important because it cause trouble for people who are depending on the callback firing order for strict order messaging. \n\nIt would be great if we can fix this in 0.10.0. But if the fix requires some bigger change, maybe we can leave this out of 0.10.0 given the issue has been there for a while. Personally I feel that throwing exception to user instead of firing callback in `send()` is a reasonable band-aid solution. It is not ideal that the users might receive ApiException when they call `send()`, but this seems less a problem than firing callback out of order. Maybe we can do this now, and later on we can make things right after fixing the exception hierarchy. That said, I am also fine if we decide to fix it post 0.10.0 and do it in the ideal way in one shot.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/198085093/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/198085573","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1087#issuecomment-198085573","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1087","id":198085573,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5ODA4NTU3Mw==","user":{"login":"Ishiihara","id":1189848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODk4NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1189848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ishiihara","html_url":"https://github.com/Ishiihara","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ishiihara/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ishiihara/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ishiihara/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ishiihara/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ishiihara/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ishiihara/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ishiihara/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ishiihara/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ishiihara/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-17T21:16:36Z","updated_at":"2016-03-17T21:17:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@hachikuji Can you rebase against trunk?

I focused on the shared part of the code as I'm not too familiar with the streams code.

However, that is an implementation change that could be done in a separate JIRA and doesn't need to block this.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/198086566/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/198088105","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1086#issuecomment-198088105","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1086","id":198088105,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5ODA4ODEwNQ==","user":{"login":"gwenshap","id":1189030,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODkwMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1189030?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap","html_url":"https://github.com/gwenshap","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-17T21:25:53Z","updated_at":"2016-03-17T21:25:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sorry, but when would a topic have 0 partitions?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/198088105/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/198088325","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1091#issuecomment-198088325","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1091","id":198088325,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5ODA4ODMyNQ==","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-17T21:26:46Z","updated_at":"2016-03-17T21:26:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@granthenke, nice catch.
