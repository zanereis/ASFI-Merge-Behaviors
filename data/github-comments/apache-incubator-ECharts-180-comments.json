Finally the relative location of axis name with axis line get.  Detailedly, in this case, `nameGap` is not the gap with axis line any more, but actually is the gap with the bounding rect of both axis line and axis labels. \r\n\r\nProcedure X will be executed twices if `containLabel` is set, the same as current implementation:\r\n    1. The first execution is before the \"coordinate system update stage\", based on the estinamed axis label layout.\r\n    2. The second execution is on the \"cartesian rendering stage\", based on the accrate axis label layout.\r\n\r\n**Procedure Y:**\r\nAjust the axis name to avoid overflowing the viewport (if it makes the axis name interfere with axis labels again, leave them there). Notice the overflow also need to be taken into account when `nameLocation` is `start` or `end`, like #9286 issued, which enables that when two cartesian exists axes align with each other without dynamic axis names overflow.\r\n\r\nProcedure Y is only be executed in the \"cartesian rendering stage\", after Procedure X executed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### (B) Enhanse the cartesian rect determine calculation when `containLabel`\r\nCurrently `containLabel` has considdered axis label (and rotation).

Ovilia, for some reason I cannot use the gallery.echartsjs.com to reproduce the case, however, you can use the official example **http://echarts.baidu.com/examples/editor.html?c=map-polygon** and copy/paste the following code to **replace the original codes from line 433 to the end**. Here are what you should expect: **a wide line on the map from 拉萨 to 大庆**. If you can see that, then **uncomment the last 7 lines of code**, which is supposed to only update the scatter data, you will notice that **the line disappears**, which does not make sense to me. Scatters and lines have been placed on **different z-level**, but it has no effect on the line's disappear. Hopefully this time I make it clear enough.
