I tried to access the endpoint for updating the data directly ('/admin/taskinstance/action/') but it looks like flask_admin responds with a 405 response code when attempting to hit the endpoint outside of flask_admin (Hitting the endpoint would have followed the standard currently established in the tests.www.test_views module). However, I was able to set up tests to test the flask_admin model itself, which, in combination with the flask_admin escape function usage, should provide the test case we're looking for. \r\n\r\nOne thing to point out is that this is effectively integration testing between the airflow SQLAlchemy Models and the flask_admin package. I'm not sure how integration testing usually works within airflow, but as far as the tests go between airflows SQLAlchemy Models and flask_admin (the main entry point for users for manipulation of airflow job meta data such as dag_runs, task_instances, etc.) this could serve as a template for a greater suite of tests regarding that functionality. \r\n\r\nAnyway, please take a look at the update to the tests and the reasoning I gave in the JIRA ticket and previous post regarding why this code should be merged. Happy to respond to design considerations.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/357367455/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/357371181","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2723#issuecomment-357371181","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2723","id":357371181,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NzM3MTE4MQ==","user":{"login":"artwr","id":1518713,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTg3MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1518713?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr","html_url":"https://github.com/artwr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-12T22:23:45Z","updated_at":"2018-01-12T22:23:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This change looks good to me.

I'll provide some context, sorry for the wall of text.\r\n\r\nThe fact that I'm running Airflow in a container makes the regular way of using assumerole (adding a profile to `~/.aws/config` and passing that profile's name to `boto3.client()` or setting the `AWS_PROFILE` env var) pretty impractical/impossible because I can't properly volume mount my `~/.aws/config`. So Airflow's option to use assumerole by setting the role-arn was very welcome.\r\nFor people who want to use assumerole when running Airflow locally it would be enough for them to set `AWS_PROFILE` (or the option to set the profile name in the extra config should be added again and Airflow does the assumerole call).\r\n\r\nAnyway, the fallback to boto3 credentials is working, I did the assumerole call myself using AWS cli and set the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` env vars based on that. After that logging to S3 worked using these credentials.\r\nDoing this is not ideal because I have to do the assumerole call myself and then convert the response from AWS to env vars and the credentials time out whereas if you leave the assumerole action to boto3 it gets renewed automatically.\r\n\r\n> I wonder if you don't have some other thing preventing S3 access.

Looks like the signal handler is already installed  in the \"operator\" process (`airflow run --raw`) [here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/blob/master/airflow/models.py#L1476-L1481), but this process never received any SIGTERM signal from the \"listener\" (`airflow run --local`). \r\n\r\nI *think* you may be referring to the LocalTaskJob not the LocalExecutor, which is what `airflow run --local` instantiates, and it starts/terminates the \"operator\" process (via the task runner).  So imho the task_runner.terminate() should be responsible for sending the signal to the \"operator\" process. Right now it only sends the signal to the _children_ of the \"operator\" process via [`kill_process_tree`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/blob/master/airflow/task/task_runner/bash_task_runner.py#L36), but not itself. \r\n\r\nOne way to fix the issue is to modify the terminate method to something roughly like the following:\r\n```\r\n    def terminate(self):\r\n        if self.process and psutil.pid_exists(self.process.pid):\r\n            kill_process_tree(self.log, self.process.pid)\r\n        root_process = psutil.Process(self.process.pid)\r\n        root_process.terminate()\r\n```\r\nI'm not sure why the root process is not signaled in the first place, so perhaps there's some other implications I'm overlooking.\r\n\r\nThat said, I don't have any experience running Airflow with Celery (we run LocalExecutor), but I am also curious about the question on handling state in distributed context.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/358559823/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/358569175","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2934#issuecomment-358569175","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2934","id":358569175,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1ODU2OTE3NQ==","user":{"login":"Acehaidrey","id":10408007,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDA4MDA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10408007?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey","html_url":"https://github.com/Acehaidrey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-18T08:08:55Z","updated_at":"2018-01-18T08:08:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Swalloow
