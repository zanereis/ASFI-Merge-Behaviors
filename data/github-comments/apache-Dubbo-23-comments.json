<dubbo.version>2.5.5</dubbo.version>\n> 其他依赖版本：\n> <spring.version>4.3.10.RELEASE</spring.version>\n> <aspectj.version>1.7.4</aspectj.version>\n> <zookeeper.version>3.4.6</zookeeper.version>\n> 问题简述：\n> 同样写法下，用注解配置的服务，部分类会走SpringCGLib代理，而部分却跳过了代理，导致事务失效。\n> 我认真比对了所有的写法，都一模一样，却出现了两种效果\n> \n> 备用解决方案：\n> 出问题的类改用xml配置，一切正常，问题应该出在 Dubbo的注解扫描\n> \n> 项目说明：\n> 使用了DBUtils，如下配置事务\n> \n>  <\\!--事务管理器配置-->\n>  <bean id=\"dataSourceProxy\" class=\"org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.TransactionAwareDataSourceProxy\">\n>      <constructor-arg name=\"targetDataSource\" ref=\"ds\"/>\n>  </bean>\n>  <bean id=\"txManager\" class=\"org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.DataSourceTransactionManager\">\n> <property name=\"dataSource\" ref=\"dataSourceProxy\"/>\n> <property name=\"nestedTransactionAllowed\" value=\"true\"/>\n> </bean>\n> <\\!--Spring JDBC和DBUtils-->\n> <bean id=\"jdbcTemplate\" class=\"org.springframework.jdbc.core.JdbcTemplate\">\n> <constructor-arg name=\"dataSource\" ref=\"dataSourceProxy\"/>\n> </bean>\n> <bean id=\"queryRunner\" class=\"org.apache.commons.dbutils.QueryRunner\">\n> <constructor-arg name=\"ds\" ref=\"dataSourceProxy\"/>\n> </bean>\n> <\\!--事务注解支持-->\n> <tx:annotation-driven transaction-manager=\"txManager\"\n>                     proxy-target-class=\"true\"/>\n> 问题信息重现：\n> 代码写法（简化中间内容）：\n> \n> 正常的如下：\n> public interface OrderCreateService {\n> ...\n> }\n> \n> @service <https://github.com/service>\n> @com.alibaba.dubbo.config.annotation.Service(version = \"1.0.0\", interfaceName = \"com.temsoft.oms.order.service.OrderCreateService\")\n> public class OrderCreateServiceImpl implements OrderCreateService {\n> ...\n> }\n> \n> 同样写法，错误的如下：\n> public interface OrdersMngService {\n> ...\n> }\n> @service <https://github.com/service>\n> @com.alibaba.dubbo.config.annotation.Service(version = \"1.0.0\", interfaceName = \"com.temsoft.oms.order.service.OrdersMngService\")\n> public class OrdersMngServiceImpl implements OrdersMngService {\n> ...\n> }\n> \n> Spring配置(spring 的扫描，我全部都用include-filter 和 use-default-filters=\"false\"， 确定没有扫描两次)：\n> \n> <dubbo:annotation />\n> \n> <context:component-scan base-package=\"com.temsoft.oms\" use-default-filters=\"false\">\n> <context:include-filter type=\"annotation\" expression=\"org.springframework.stereotype.Service\"/>\n> <context:include-filter type=\"annotation\" expression=\"org.springframework.stereotype.Component\"/>\n> <context:include-filter type=\"annotation\" expression=\"org.springframework.stereotype.Repository\"/>\n> </context:component-scan>\n> \n> 说明：在测试过程中发现，错误的类（OrdersMngService）在Jrebel重载时也会是重载的Spring CGLib代理的类，但是Dubbo调用的依旧跳过了该代理。\n> \n> 错误说明方式：服务端按简述方式编写，消费端直接调用，目标函数直接报异常，传出调用栈，栈信息如下：\n> \n> 错误调用栈：\n> java.lang.NullPointerException\n> at
