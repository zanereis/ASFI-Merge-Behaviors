when I add more test cases for \"outer joins\" with local predicates, I found different limitations between tableAPI and SQL, e.g., \"SELECT c, g FROM Table3 left outer join Table5 on a = d AND e < 3\" is valid, but dsFromTuple3.leftOuterJoin(dsFromTuple5, 'a === 'd && 'e < 3) is invalid, because validation in Join node sees original join predicates and validates simply, while in DataSetJoinRule the join predicates could be pruned according to the equivalence in relational algebra. \r\nI have a question, should we keep the tableAPI consistent with SQL? If so, the validation in tableAPI will be much more complex, and it reminds me the previous discussion about validation either in one or two places.

But it seems that you misunderstand the SQL OVER syntax. \r\nThe OVER clause defines a window or user-specified set of rows within a query result set. A window function then computes a value for each row in the window. It is similar to Row-Window proposed in [FLIP-11](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/FLIP-11%3A+Table+API+Stream+Aggregations), but is different with Sliding Row-count window.\r\n\r\nFor example, OVER (ROWS 2 PRECEDING) means that the window of rows that the function operates on is three rows in size, starting with 2 rows preceding until and including the current row.\r\n\r\nSay we have a table `T1` \r\n\r\n```\r\nt  a  \r\n-----\r\n1  1 \r\n2  5 \r\n3  3 \r\n4  5 \r\n5  4 \r\n6 11\r\n```\r\n\r\nand the following SQL will yield:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT t, a, sum(a) OVER (ROWS 2 PRECEDING) FROM T1\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nt  a  avg\r\n----------\r\n1  1  1\r\n2  5  6\r\n3  3  9\r\n4  5  13\r\n5  4  12\r\n6 11  20\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor Row-window, we would need something more complex, especially when we need to order by timestamp. For example, to support event-time count-window row-window, we need to create a custom operator that collects records in a priority queue ordered by timestamp. Once a watermark is received for the upper bound of a window, the priority queue is used to evaluate the window function (based on count) and to purge too old records. \r\n\r\nI would suggest this PR to wait for FLINK-4679.

@ramkrish86, @tonycox, and @wuchong,\r\n\r\nsorry for joining the discussion a bit late. I haven't looked at the code yet, but I think the discussion is going into the right direction. \r\n\r\nI had a look at [how Apache Drill provides access to HBase tables](https://drill.apache.org/docs/querying-hbase/). Drill also uses a nested schema of `[rowkey, colfamily1[col1, col2, ...], colfamiliy2[col1, col2, ...] ...]` so basically the same as we are discussing here.\r\n\r\nRegarding the field types: The serialization is not under our control, so should also offer to just return the raw bytes (as Drill does). If users have custom data types or serialization logic they can use a user defined scalar function to extract the value. I don't know what's the standard serialization format for primitives with HBase (or if there is one at all). \r\n\r\nRegarding restricting the scan with rowkeys. @tonycox's PR for [filterable TableSources](https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3166) can be used to set the scan range.

If not, users can ask this field to return raw bytes in this way:  `htableSchame.add(\"column_family\", \"qualifier\", byte[].class)` and then use an user defined scalar function to deserialize the value.\r\n\r\nRegarding to the rowkeys, I agree with you. It would be great if we can set scan range by WHERE clause.

I'd like to include this fix after the restructuring, so please let me know on how you'd like to proceed with this contribution :-) Thank you!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/274424522/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/274424975","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3035#issuecomment-274424975","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3035","id":274424975,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NDQyNDk3NQ==","user":{"login":"tzulitai","id":5284370,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODQzNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5284370?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai","html_url":"https://github.com/tzulitai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-23T08:20:36Z","updated_at":"2017-01-23T08:21:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @BrainLogic, we're still seeing this exception in tests sometimes, and it'll be great to have this fixed soon.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know on how you'd like to proceed with the contribution (including my above comment), otherwise if you don't have time, I can also pick it up :-) Thank you!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/274424975/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/274425933","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3031#issuecomment-274425933","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3031","id":274425933,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NDQyNTkzMw==","user":{"login":"tzulitai","id":5284370,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODQzNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5284370?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai","html_url":"https://github.com/tzulitai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-23T08:26:02Z","updated_at":"2017-01-23T08:26:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you for the contribution @MayerRoman.
