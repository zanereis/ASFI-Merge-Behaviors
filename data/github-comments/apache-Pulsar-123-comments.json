@merlimat Is this a breaking change? For example, if a user has set up a pulsar cluster and use https://example.pulsar.com.

With your change, the client will be connect to 80 and 443, but fail.\r\n\r\nI think the breaking change was in  #3249. Before that, `https` was correctly resolving to 443 and `http` to 80.\r\n\r\n> If Pulsar's default http and https ports are 8080 and 8443, we should try to stick to Pulsar's default value, not the general http and https default values. Otherwise it might be break Pulsar 2.3.x clients, right?\r\n\r\nThe fact that on server side we use 8080 and 8443 by default, shouldn't mean that a client should hide the port for that. \r\n\r\nThis is seriously confusing. `https://my-broker.com` must mean port 443.
