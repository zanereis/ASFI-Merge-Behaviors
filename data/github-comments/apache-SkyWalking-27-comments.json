The new feature is non of 58's business. If i am not a employee in a company , so what? I think the core question is the module are so large and need some test.I will take care the tests.\r\n\r\nWe always treat every contributor as individual. The major concern is about maintaining. I am not worried about providing a feature with bug( every one's codes have bugs ), instead, I am worried have no one to fix bugs in time.\r\n\r\nAnother reason I asked for public news, is about the end user cases of this features. The community is driven by the end users, right?\r\n\r\nHope I explain myself clear. :)\r\n\r\nSo if you want to try, we can accept this as an incubating feature first. But then, you have the following responsibilities:\r\n1. Take part in test and Apache release process, because after merged, this feature is part of it.\r\n1. Sync the changes in our default es implementations.\r\n\r\nThe incubating feature at least last 3-6 month, if this feature is stable, has public user case for this feature, and you are still active, we can change this into core feature, even default implementation. \r\n\r\n@cyberdak Is this good enough for you?\r\n\r\nIf so, you should work on resolve conflicts and documents, including settings, usage, and log to tell people how to change the implementation to ES-http.\r\n\r\nAnd please test es-http storage after you sync the master's codes. \r\n\r\nBTW, I am definitely sure, there are several new type(table)s are going to add in beta.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/378133978/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/378142457","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/1018#issuecomment-378142457","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/1018","id":378142457,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3ODE0MjQ1Nw==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-03T06:29:27Z","updated_at":"2018-04-03T10:35:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\n[![Coverage
