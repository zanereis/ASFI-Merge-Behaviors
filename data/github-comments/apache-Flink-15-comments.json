This will probably automatically lead to cleaner code, better code comments, better error handling and so on.\nI'm still not convinced to merge the code in the state its currently in. Therefore, I'm just facing too many issues right now. That the example in the documentation is broken is certainly not the dealbreaker here. Issues like hard to find error messages or the issues I had with the wordcount (I don't know if its the runtime or an issue of the Python code)\n\nPlease don't get my feedback here wrong. I appreciate and see that this has been a lot of work, and we are probably close to 100% (we are probably in the 90s already). Whats needed are people to test this in different environments, with different expectations etc. .. then we'll probably quickly achieve 100% (for a first prototype!)\n\nIn my opinion, we have two options now:\n- We try quickly find people (mailing lists, contacts) willing to test the Python API and @zentol fixes these issues until we have enough confidence to merge it. \n- We go a step back with the Python API and follow the approach similar to the streaming system and the graph API (\"gelly\"): We create a separate github project where the project can exist for some time. Such a repository would allow @zentol to easily collaborate with other contributors.\n\nI think the two options very much depend on the number of people we find to test the python API and the willingness of @zentol to fix the issues alone.\nIf others share my concern with limited number of contributors, we should probably put the code into a separate directory for a while.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/72533930/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/72537053","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/202#issuecomment-72537053","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/202","id":72537053,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyNTM3MDUz","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-02T21:02:43Z","updated_at":"2015-02-02T21:14:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"\"hard to find error messages\" what do you mean by that?\n\nwhat did you run the job with (data size, dop) ? did it happen multiple times?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/72537053/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/72547127","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/202#issuecomment-72547127","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/202","id":72547127,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyNTQ3MTI3","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-02T21:59:32Z","updated_at":"2015-02-02T21:59:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Asking others to implement the standard example programs has worked quite well to identify issues with new APIs.

There is one issue I would really like to fix, and that is the serializability of the `Instance` class. This class is not meant to be serialized and moved around, which can be reflected by the fact that it holds an Actor Ref, and the necessity to make a lot of the fields transient.\n\nI assume that the instance needs to be serialized as part of the ExechutionGraph archiving, where the ExecutionGraph is sent via an actor message to the archiver.\n\nI would like to solve that differently. The execution graph is \"cleaned\" before archiving (see #344 ) to reduce memory footprint. At this point, I would replace the `Instance` in the Executions with the `Instance Connection Info`, which holds all info necessary.

are now the second person to report that creating the tmp files does not work on OS X. i don't know why that doesn't work. the file creation is done from java, is there any magic required there? i can't debug OS X error myself at the moment. all i can do on that front is add sanity checks for better error reporting.\n\nthe included triangle enumeration is kinda odd, even if it runs the output is empty; Ive already checked the implementation yesterday and it appears equal to the java counterpart. will give it another go.\n\nthe plan execution is one of the more fragile parts. generally, when the process exits with an error it is noticed. but if for example something is missing (like the call to execute) things just get stuck. this is due to the fact that information is only ever sent
