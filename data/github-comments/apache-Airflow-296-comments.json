Other providers and developers can also learn from them and after changes, introduce to their operators. We also want to have tests for other services, but there were no people willing to develop system tests. Here, I think it is worth developing them, but this is not necessary if you do not have time.

Really sorry for not getting back before - I've been travelling and missed that last comment.\r\n\r\nFantastic work! I really liked how you explained the steps you did to make it works! Kudos!\r\n\r\n> So, although I'm hesitant that something about travis won't provide us with all the permissions that we need, I'm going to give it a try to add a docker compose file to reproduce this. My question for you is how I should go about providing this integration - the examples given previously expose services, and for this case we would want an environment with airflow and singularity in the same space. Do you have thoughts or examples for how to approach this?\r\n\r\nTravis and any other environment will provide all that we need. We already run in privileged mode (and pretty much all CI systems allow that in order to make all kinds of docker-in-docker approach). In fact what we already do is we are mounting docker socket to within the airflow-testing so that you can even run docker commands to reach out the host docker engine. This is needed to run kind (Kubernetes-In-Docker).\r\n \r\n> And then given that we can add a custom container, it would need to use one of the Singularity bases (note they are alpine), and then also include dependencies for airflow (or is the install already handled given the container, and happens before the testing?) Either way, if customization is needed on top of the Singularity base (that isn't handled by the testing suite) what would be the best way to do this - building the image elsewhere and using here, or building on demand?\r\n\r\nHmm, I'd assume that having a base Singularity should be enough and that we can reach it via \"singularity\" host name via docker compose. But I understand you need to build in some Airflow dependencies in? Am I right? What kind of dependencies you need to build in that container? Is this like local airflow sources or some airflow dependencies? Excuse my ignorance as I do not know much about singularity. \r\nWe have few approaches we can get:\r\n1) In case of Kubernetes (Kind) we are using RUNTIME=\"kubernetes\" env and we are checking that in the initial CI scripts - if the RUNTIME=\"kubernetes\" we will install kubernetes-in-docker cluster and provision it with the latest Airflow locally built CI image and then we run our tests with this.  This is most complex thing we do and I hope we do not have to do the same.\r\n\r\n2) If those are about some small packages to install at running singularity after it is started already, we could simply do it in the CI scripts when we start up and see \"INTEGRATION_SINGULARITY\" is set to \"true\" (this will be properly set to true if you add it similarly to other integrations of ours and when --integration singularity switch is used).\r\n\r\n3) If you need something pre-backed in the Docker image itself then I think we need a separate Dockerfile with FROM: singularity and some steps to build the dockerfile before docker-compose is run (and refer to the newly built image in Docker compose. My best bet if that is the case, that would be that you build and test such images locally for local testing and once it works I can help to integrate it in the CI scripts properly (You can try yourself - this will likely be just appropriate 'docker build' command executed only when --integration singularity is used)\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope this is helpful!\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/579315631/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/579333636","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/7273#issuecomment-579333636","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/7273","id":579333636,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3OTMzMzYzNg==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-28T16:24:07Z","updated_at":"2020-01-28T20:12:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#

There are few of scripts to update. But it's not that hard at the end.\r\n\r\nI think a custom `--start-singularity` `--stop-singularity` switches should be added similar to `--start-kind-cluster` `--stop-kind-cluster`.\r\n\r\nIt's best if you look for RUNTIME capital wherever it's used but here is the guide\r\n\r\nBreeze (for local development and testing your solution):\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/breeze-complete#L40 -> options to add runtime are added here amongst others\r\n- https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/breeze#L203 -> Displaying chosen RUNTIME\r\n- https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/breeze#L595 -> Flags of Breeze\r\n- https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/breeze#L1007 -> that's where RUNTIME leads to adding extra docker compose\r\n- https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/breeze#L391 -> help describing the options.\r\n\r\nDocker Compose:\r\n- https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/scripts/ci/docker-compose/runtime-kubernetes.yml - similar should be created for singularity and used in Breeze.\r\n\r\nIn container:\r\n- https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/scripts/ci/in_container/entrypoint_ci.sh#L164 - entrypoint for the CI where Kubernetes is started after choosing the RUNTIME=\"kubernetes\" here is where the setup for singularity can be done. It runs https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/scripts/ci/in_container/kubernetes/setup_kind_cluster.sh under the hood. \r\n\r\nThat's it for interactive \"local\" breeze session. T\r\n\r\nThen if you run tests the script goes further. It builds airflow kubernetes image and deploys it to kubernetes. In interactive session, the deployment should be run manually as described in https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/TESTING.rst#running-tests-with-kubernetes \r\n\r\nbut if you run tests in travis (RUN_TESTS=\"true\") those steps are executed manually.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/scripts/ci/in_container/entrypoint_ci.sh#L218 you have the deployment of image to kubernetes: https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/scripts/ci/in_container/deploy_airflow_to_kubernetes.sh and one of the scripts it runs https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/scripts/ci/in_container/kubernetes/docker/rebuild_airflow_image.sh - that's where the Kubernetes image is built.\r\n\r\nI hope that's enough leads.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/579443300/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/579455800","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/7276#issuecomment-579455800","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/7276","id":579455800,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3OTQ1NTgwMA==","user":{"login":"tooptoop4","id":33283496,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjgzNDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33283496?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tooptoop4","html_url":"https://github.com/tooptoop4","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tooptoop4/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tooptoop4/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tooptoop4/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tooptoop4/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tooptoop4/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tooptoop4/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tooptoop4/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tooptoop4/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tooptoop4/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-28T21:06:28Z","updated_at":"2020-01-28T21:06:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"hmm, I use BranchPythonOperator and clear command a lot and I never see the skipped tasks just run on clear. do u use none_failed ?

If you have any issues or are unsure about any anything please check our Contribution Guide (https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst)\nHere are some useful points:\n- Pay attention to the quality of your code (flake8, pylint and type annotations). Our [pre-commits]( https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/STATIC_CODE_CHECKS.rst#prerequisites-for-pre-commit-hooks) will help you with that.\n- In case of a new feature add useful documentation (in docstrings or in `docs/` directory). Adding a new operator? Check this short [guide](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/docs/howto/custom-operator.rst) Consider adding an example DAG that shows how users should use it.\n- Consider using [Breeze environment](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/BREEZE.rst) for testing locally, it’s a heavy docker but it ships with a working Airflow and a lot of integrations.\n- Be patient and persistent. It might take some time to get a review or get the final approval from Committers.\nApache Airflow is a community-driven project and together we are making it better 🚀.\nIn case of doubts contact the developers at:\nMailing List: dev@airflow.apache.org\nSlack:

If you have any issues or are unsure about any anything please check our Contribution Guide (https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst)\nHere are some useful points:\n- Pay attention to the quality of your code (flake8, pylint and type annotations). Our [pre-commits]( https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/STATIC_CODE_CHECKS.rst#prerequisites-for-pre-commit-hooks) will help you with that.\n- In case of a new feature add useful documentation (in docstrings or in `docs/` directory). Adding a new operator? Check this short [guide](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/docs/howto/custom-operator.rst) Consider adding an example DAG that shows how users should use it.\n- Consider using [Breeze environment](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/BREEZE.rst) for testing locally, it’s a heavy docker but it ships with a working Airflow and a lot of integrations.\n- Be patient and persistent. It might take some time to get a review or get the final approval from Committers.\nApache Airflow is a community-driven project and together we are making it better 🚀.\nIn case of doubts contact the

so I'm tracing the kubernetes (runtime) as an example, and I have a quick question. In scripts/ci/in_container/entrypoint_ci.sh I see that given the kubernetes runtime, you are setting some variable for a container name to be the airflow name with suffix \"-kubernetes.\"\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nif [[ ${RUNTIME:=\"\"} == \"kubernetes\" ]]; then\r\n    unset KRB5_CONFIG\r\n    unset KRB5_KTNAME\r\n    export AIRFLOW_KUBERNETES_IMAGE=${AIRFLOW_CI_IMAGE}-kubernetes\r\n    AIRFLOW_KUBERNETES_IMAGE_NAME=$(echo \"${AIRFLOW_KUBERNETES_IMAGE}\" | cut -f 1 -d \":\")\r\n    export AIRFLOW_KUBERNETES_IMAGE_NAME\r\n    AIRFLOW_KUBERNETES_IMAGE_TAG=$(echo \"${AIRFLOW_KUBERNETES_IMAGE}\" | cut -f 2 -d \":\")\r\n    export AIRFLOW_KUBERNETES_IMAGE_TAG\r\nfi\r\n```\r\nWhat isn't clear is where this container is built, and then where it gets used again? At this point we are already sitting inside the airflow-testing container after a command like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nelse if [[ ${RUNTIME:=} == \"singularity\" ]]; then\r\n    set +u\r\n    # shellcheck disable=SC2016\r\n    docker-compose --log-level INFO \\\r\n      -f \"${MY_DIR}/docker-compose/base.yml\" \\\r\n      -f \"${MY_DIR}/docker-compose/backend-${BACKEND}.yml\" \\\r\n      -f \"${MY_DIR}/docker-compose/runtime-singularity.yml\" \\\r\n      \"${INTEGRATIONS[@]}\" \\\r\n      \"${DOCKER_COMPOSE_LOCAL[@]}\" \\\r\n         run airflow-testing \\\r\n           '/opt/airflow/scripts/ci/in_container/entrypoint_ci.sh \"${@}\"' \\\r\n           /opt/airflow/scripts/ci/in_container/entrypoint_ci.sh \"${@}\"\r\n         # Note the command is there twice (!) because it is passed via bash -c\r\n         # and bash -c starts passing parameters from $0. TODO: fixme\r\n    set -u\r\n```\r\nand this would suggest the container is brought up inside of this container? Wouldn't it make more sense to have a docker-compose run that runs some equivalent of airflow-testing but with Singularity installed inside?
