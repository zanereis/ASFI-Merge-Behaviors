 We haven't addressed the issue of adding the guard conditions back yet. \r\n\r\n@ZihengJiang \r\n\r\nThere is one more thing with the loop partition that can be improved. That is right now If the HalideIR has more than one conditions and if the intersection of their deduced bounds are empty then, loop partition will skip the partition altogether. \r\n\r\ne.g.  something like the following: \r\n\r\n```\r\nFor (i, 0, 16)\r\n  if(likely(i == 14))\r\n    if(likely (i == 15))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue is stemming from the following line: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/11a3a777ec78ad81ce12a940d07521870f546ad1/src/pass/loop_partition.cc#L405\r\n\r\n\r\nI was thinking about the solution to the task of the removing assumption and it reminded me of this issue as well.  \r\n\r\nThe solution to task1 (removing assumption) could simply be using simplifier instead of directly eliminating the conditions. \r\n\r\nThe solution to the empty intersection issue (task2) could be that we can consider only one condition at a time for the partition instead of a collection of the conditions.  Now Let's say we follow this solution to task2.  In that case, we need to somehow tag condition that has already been considered for the partition to avoid considering the same condition repeatedly when simplifier is not able to simplify that. \r\n\r\nI wanted to address both the issues at the same time, since solving one without another would potentially require design change each time. \r\n\r\nI am busy with some other work at the time moment. So, @ZihengJiang if you want to take up the task, please go ahead. \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/542436434/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/542461348","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3865#issuecomment-542461348","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3865","id":542461348,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MjQ2MTM0OA==","user":{"login":"wweic","id":594848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/594848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic","html_url":"https://github.com/wweic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-16T00:41:52Z","updated_at":"2019-10-16T00:41:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think `for_node_list` in function `update_for` can just be a `Node*`, no need to use `vector`. otherwise lGTM.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/542461348/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/542475037","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4129#issuecomment-542475037","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4129","id":542475037,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MjQ3NTAzNw==","user":{"login":"wweic","id":594848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/594848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic","html_url":"https://github.com/wweic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-16T01:51:50Z","updated_at":"2019-10-16T01:51:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm under the impression that for operators that accepts/returns dynamic shape tensor, we just need to implement the shape function.

Just as then mentioned https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/issues/4105#issuecomment-542032766. We can have different frontends but only one backend. In my previous implement, users can only use fragments with 16x16x16 shape and row-major layout. To solve this problem, Minmin uses `new_expr`.  Here I proposed a new design here. We use attributes to transmit metadata. Here is an example:\r\n```\r\n// attr [A.shared.wmma.matrix_a] storage_scope = \"wmma.matrix_a\"\r\n// attr [A.shared.wmma.matrix_a] fragment_layout = \"row_major\"\r\n// attr [A.shared.wmma.matrix_a] fragment_shape = \"16, 16, 16\"\r\nallocate A.shared.wmma.matrix_a[float16 * 1024]\r\n```\r\nThis sulotion has been accepted by Minmin and his team. Thanks for supporting my propsal.\r\nUsers can set these configuration in tensor intrinsics\r\n``` Python\r\ndef intrin_wmma_load_matrix(scope):\r\n    n = 16\r\n    A = tvm.placeholder((n, n), name='A', dtype='float16')\r\n    BA = tvm.decl_buffer(A.shape, A.dtype, scope='shared', data_alignment=32, offset_factor=256)\r\n    C = tvm.compute((n, n), lambda i, j: A[i, j], name='C')\r\n    BC = tvm.decl_buffer(C.shape, C.dtype, scope=scope, data_alignment=32, offset_factor=256)\r\n\r\n    def intrin_func(ins, outs):\r\n        ib = tvm.ir_builder.create()\r\n\r\n        BA = ins[0]\r\n        BC = outs[0]\r\n        # shape (n, n, n) and 'row_major' layout\r\n        ib.emit(tvm.call_intrin('handle', 'tvm_load_matrix_sync',\r\n                                BC.data, n, n, n, BC.elem_offset // 256,\r\n                                BA.access_ptr('r'), n, 'row_major'))\r\n        return ib.get()\r\n\r\n    return tvm.decl_tensor_intrin(C.op, intrin_func, binds={A: BA, C: BC})\r\n```\r\nThere is a new IR_pass will transmit these information from intrinsic to attributes.\r\n\r\nI am really happy to cooperate with Minmin's team.

It is my negligence forgetting to support int type. But one thing worths noting is that int type TensorCores are only supported on Turing GPUs. I can't access any Turing GPUs. It should work but need more testing.\r\n\r\nAs for the performance. Currently, we are faster than CUBLAS/CUDNN on small shapes but slower on large shapes. In fact, the performance depends on the scheduling but not the tvm implement. I believe that I have the same performance as Minmin's. Even the CUDA code is the same. I have to admit there should be a better schedule on specific shapes.  Any better schedule is welcomed. However, I believe that it should be done by autotvm rather than human beings.

It is my negligence forgetting to support int type. But one thing worths noting is that int type TensorCores are only supported on Turing GPUs. I can't access any Turing GPUs. It should work but need more testing.\r\n> \r\n> As for the performance. Currently, we are faster than CUBLAS/CUDNN on small shapes but slower on large shapes. In fact, the performance depends on the scheduling but not the tvm implement. I believe that I have the same performance as Minmin's. Even the CUDA code is the same. I have to admit there should be a better schedule on specific shapes. Any better schedule is welcomed. However, I believe that it should be done by autotvm rather than human beings.\r\n\r\nVolta GPUs have int support as well. I tested int8 GEMM using wmma instructions on a V100 GPU. It has even better support than Turing architecture.

That could well be an introspection route like probing some environment variables if clinfo or cuda provides that information or on cpu architectures this is the route that I've preferred.\r\n\r\n/proc/cpuinfo is available only on linux, doesn't easily translate to other OS's and then there might be other local variations in terms of the string formats that the output produced looks like on different OS's and different versions of the OS's and different architecture platforms. For instance the output of /proc/cpuinfo on arm and x86_64 could be different.  I don't know the route to getting such system information on other platforms like Windows or MacOS. \r\n\r\n\r\nif (target_cpu_arch == aarch64))\r\n { \r\n   // check if low level dependency -> for eg. llvm supports this feature.\r\n   // If no skip the test ; return;\r\n   // generate_simple_program equivalent to (\"int main (void) { __asm__ volatile (\" instruction/ feature to be tested\"); return 0; } ;\r\n   // retval = compile_and_execute () ;\r\n   // if (retval == 0)\r\n   //  can run the test\r\n   // else\r\n   //  skip the test ; // Expect a SIGILL\r\n} \r\n\r\nAdvantages  : \r\n\r\n- Keeps this localized to specific architecture and the instruction feature being tested. \r\n- /proc/cpuinfo might have funny strings.

We probably should use all 4 Gold cores.\r\n\r\n```\r\n1|cepheus:/ $ cat  /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/cpuinfo_max_freq                                                                                                            \r\n1785600\r\ncepheus:/ $ cat  /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/cpufreq/cpuinfo_max_freq                                                                                                              \r\n1785600\r\ncepheus:/ $ cat  /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu2/cpufreq/cpuinfo_max_freq                                                                                                              \r\n1785600\r\ncepheus:/ $ cat  /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu3/cpufreq/cpuinfo_max_freq                                                                                                              \r\n1785600\r\ncepheus:/ $ cat  /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu4/cpufreq/cpuinfo_max_freq                                                                                                              \r\n2419200\r\ncepheus:/ $ cat  /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu5/cpufreq/cpuinfo_max_freq                                                                                                              \r\n2419200\r\ncepheus:/ $ cat  /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu6/cpufreq/cpuinfo_max_freq                                                                                                              \r\n2419200\r\ncepheus:/ $ cat  /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu7/cpufreq/cpuinfo_max_freq                                                                                                              \r\n2841600\r\n```\r\nhttps://en.wikichip.org/wiki/qualcomm/snapdragon_800/855\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/543543926/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/543556469","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4145#issuecomment-543556469","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4145","id":543556469,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MzU1NjQ2OQ==","user":{"login":"yidawang","id":4458509,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NTg1MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4458509?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yidawang","html_url":"https://github.com/yidawang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yidawang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yidawang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yidawang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yidawang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yidawang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yidawang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yidawang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yidawang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yidawang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-18T07:05:19Z","updated_at":"2019-10-18T16:31:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Agreed that both concerns are valid. And I am also positive with the multi-instance use case of TVM.\r\n\r\nI discussed with @apivovarov , it seems that the modern Linux OS is smart enough to place the threads to different physical cores (even in the context of hyperthreading) if possible. And we don't see much unnecessary thread migration during the execution. Therefore, it seems that in some case explicit thread binding may not be necessary. However, I admit that our observation is limited, thread binding may be critical in some system. Therefore, having the thread binding enabled by default still sounds reasonable.\r\n\r\nGiven the situation, I would propose that we can add one more ENV VAR to specify the first core `i` to bind (default 0), and binding `n` threads to core `i`... `i+n-1`, respectively. So in the multi-instance case, we can specify `TVM_NUM_THREAD=1 TVM_FIRST_CORE=0` for the first instance, and `TVM_NUM_THREAD=1 TVM_FIRST_CORE=1` for the second instance.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/543556469/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/543586893","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4146#issuecomment-543586893","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4146","id":543586893,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MzU4Njg5Mw==","user":{"login":"altanh","id":3124994,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjQ5OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3124994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/altanh","html_url":"https://github.com/altanh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/altanh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/altanh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/altanh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/altanh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/altanh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/altanh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/altanh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/altanh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/altanh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-18T08:09:02Z","updated_at":"2019-10-18T08:09:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I fixed the AD pass type issue by fixing the existing code used to preserve type information across the transformation.

And how are different dispatch contexts managed in this case?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/543847139/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/543854143","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4136#issuecomment-543854143","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4136","id":543854143,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0Mzg1NDE0Mw==","user":{"login":"Laurawly","id":3700467,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDA0Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3700467?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly","html_url":"https://github.com/Laurawly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-18T17:37:52Z","updated_at":"2019-10-18T17:37:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@were @merrymercy Can you help to review this PR as well?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/543854143/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/543859895","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4142#issuecomment-543859895","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4142","id":543859895,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0Mzg1OTg5NQ==","user":{"login":"zhiics","id":5145158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDUxNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5145158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics","html_url":"https://github.com/zhiics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-18T17:51:46Z","updated_at":"2019-10-18T17:51:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks @anijain2305 @FrozenGene @jackwish.
