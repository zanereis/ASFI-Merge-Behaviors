Since the only place we use this holder object is in the `AbstractMethodInterceptor.java` (Pls correct me if I'm wrong)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/skywalking/blob/47b46f93caf20210995aba7fb6814ed82aeb8260/apm-sniffer/apm-sdk-plugin/spring-plugins/mvc-annotation-commons/src/main/java/org/apache/skywalking/apm/plugin/spring/mvc/commons/interceptor/AbstractMethodInterceptor.java#L99-L100\r\n\r\nWe can check the type of the class on-site with `if`-condition, for example, \r\n\r\n```java\r\nObject request = ContextManager.getRuntimeContext().get(REQUEST_KEY_IN_RUNTIME_CONTEXT);\r\n\r\nif (javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest.class.isAssignableFrom(request.getClass())) {\r\n...\r\n} else if (org.springframework.http.server.reactive.ServerHttpRequest.class.isAssignableFrom(request.getClass())) {\r\n...\r\n} else {\r\nthrow new UnsupportedOperationException(\"this line should not be reached\");\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny better idea is welcome.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/843056889/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/843103601","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/6951#issuecomment-843103601","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/6951","id":843103601,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0MzEwMzYwMQ==","user":{"login":"huhu-sky","id":12699301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjk5MzAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12699301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huhu-sky","html_url":"https://github.com/huhu-sky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huhu-sky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huhu-sky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huhu-sky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huhu-sky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huhu-sky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huhu-sky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huhu-sky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huhu-sky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huhu-sky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-18T11:51:50Z","updated_at":"2021-05-18T11:51:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> I think the default should be a shaded package?

would summarize the idea here,\r\n\r\n- `InvocableHandlerMethodInstrumentation` has switched to Plugin API v2. Thus we can take advantage of the performance improvement while sharing Reference between `InvokeInterceptor.beforeMethod` and  `InvokeInterceptor.afterMethod`\r\n\r\nAfter some investigation for the reactive scenario, the execution order of the `InvokeInterceptor` and `AbstractMethodInterceptor` is listed below,\r\n\r\n1. `InvokeInterceptor.beforeMethod`\r\n2. `InvokeInterceptor.afterMethod`\r\n3. `AbstractMethodInterceptor.beforeMethod`\r\n4. `AbstractMethodInterceptor.afterMethod`\r\n\r\nIn order to record the real span of the async execution in the controller, we need to add a hook with the help of `Mono.doFinally`, which will be executed asynchronously.\r\n\r\nSo we need to pass the span from `AbstractMethodInterceptor.afterMethod` to `InvokeInterceptor.afterMethod` which seems impossible. But we can do it with a Reference Container. \r\n\r\n- In the past, the author used `ResponseHolder`, but due to the ClassLoader issue, it should be removed.\r\n- Now, I use a primitive array (`[]AbstractSpan`) as a slot.\r\n\r\nWe follows the previous idea,\r\n\r\n- First, we put the slot in the RuntimeContext, as well as the `MethodInvocationContext` (MIC). So that we can access it in the `InvokeInterceptor.afterMethod`\r\n- Then, we fetch the slot from `AbstractMethodInterceptor.afterMethod` and fulfill the slot with the real `AbstractSpan`. Afterwards we can safely remove the RuntimeContext.\r\n- Finally, when the lambda passed to the `Mono.doFinally` is executed, we can take it out from the MIC which is lexically captured by the lambda expression.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/845838177/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/845868036","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/5307#issuecomment-845868036","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/5307","id":845868036,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0NTg2ODAzNg==","user":{"login":"pope12389","id":9252880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyNTI4ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9252880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pope12389","html_url":"https://github.com/pope12389","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pope12389/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pope12389/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pope12389/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pope12389/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pope12389/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pope12389/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pope12389/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pope12389/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pope12389/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-21T10:57:11Z","updated_at":"2021-05-21T10:57:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"WARN 2021-05-21 18:48:11:525 task-executor-1 TracingContext : More than 300 spans required to create \r\njava.lang.RuntimeException: Shadow tracing context.

The rate usually only counts one per page if there are multiple errors.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/846527694/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/846561474","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/6140#issuecomment-846561474","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/6140","id":846561474,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0NjU2MTQ3NA==","user":{"login":"tbongiovani","id":2412686,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MTI2ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2412686?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbongiovani","html_url":"https://github.com/tbongiovani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbongiovani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbongiovani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbongiovani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbongiovani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbongiovani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbongiovani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbongiovani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbongiovani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbongiovani/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-23T13:14:23Z","updated_at":"2021-05-23T13:14:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> I config in application.yml\r\n> storage.selector: ${SW_STORAGE:elasticsearch7}\r\n> storage.elasticsearch7.nameSpace: ${SW_NAMESPACE:\"elasticsearch\"}\r\n\r\nwork for me! tks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/846561474/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/846697456","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/6995#issuecomment-846697456","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/6995","id":846697456,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0NjY5NzQ1Ng==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-24T03:00:06Z","updated_at":"2021-05-24T03:00:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Can't see the relationship.
