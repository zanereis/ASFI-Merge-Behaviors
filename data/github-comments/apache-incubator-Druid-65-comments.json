Can you clarify how this is handled for a metric like `segment/count`?  In the Coordinator this metric has dimension `datasource` which is left off by default in the Graphite Emitter.   Assuming this metric displays instantaneous values, rather than deltas (i.e. ds1 has 10 segments, not ds1 += 10 segments), how are these aggregated at Graphite's end?  Druid would be emitting 2 different metrics `segment/count.ds1 = 10` & `segment/count.ds2=50` but we would only send `segment/count = 10` & `segment/count = 50`. Are these intended to be averaged by Ganglia?
