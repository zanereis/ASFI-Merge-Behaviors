Maybe it would be best if you took over this PR (per your previous suggestion) as you're much more well versed on exactly how this all works.\r\n\r\nThe `cache_key_wrapper` method is good to leave as-is for cases where users want to add values to `extra_cache_keys` other than the predefined `current_username()` etc. However, the documentation probably needs to be updated to reflect the fact that the predefined jinja functions don't need to be wrapped.\r\n\r\n> My one concern is it seems that the `extra_cache_keys` is merely a list of values, i.e., `user_1`, `user_2` etc. however there's not scope and thus there could be collision. I wonder if it should be a dictionary of values keyed by method with more context, i.e,.\r\n> \r\n> ```python\r\n> {\r\n>     \"current_user_id\": [\"user_1\", \"user_2\",], \r\n>     \"url_param\": [{\"foo\": \"bar\"},],\r\n> }\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> Note in the case of the URL parameters having both the key and value is probably necessary for completeness.\r\n\r\nWith regards to `extra_cache_keys` being a list, I don't think it's a big issue, as the extra cache keys will probably always be added sequentially. So if we're adding two keys `key1` and `key2`, with values `value1` and `value2` respectively, it probably won't make a big difference if we're using `{\"key1\": \"value1\", \"key2\": \"value2\"}` or `[\"value1\", \"value2\"]`. While there is the theoretical risk that the code adds different keys inder different circumstances, to my understanding this has not been an issue during the time this has been available (since last summer).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/618392655/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/618429802","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/9444#issuecomment-618429802","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/9444","id":618429802,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxODQyOTgwMg==","user":{"login":"bkyryliuk","id":5727938,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Mjc5Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5727938?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk","html_url":"https://github.com/bkyryliuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-23T14:33:11Z","updated_at":"2020-04-23T14:33:11Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":">

seems to target some specific use cases while different companies/data pipelines may use partitions differently. AFAIK, there can be two cases when a datetime column is used as partition keys:\r\n\r\n1. daily snapshots of full tables, such as product inventory, registered users, etc.\r\n2. incremental logs, where each partition only contains new data in the given time period.\r\n\r\nThis feature would be very useful for the first scenario, but not so much for the second, and probably even less for a non-datetime column such as `cluster` in the example.\r\n\r\nQuestions and suggestions:\r\n\r\n1. Partitions have hierarchies, in the example `hr` is probably subfolders within `date`, does selecting `hr` mean using the latest `hr` partition from the latest `date`?\r\n2. Instead of adding a new tab, how about making the filter value an option list with a \"Latest partition\" option:\r\n   \r\n   ![Slice

parition\" and value of `presto.latest_partition(...)`.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/618692895/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/618706498","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/9640#issuecomment-618706498","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/9640","id":618706498,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxODcwNjQ5OA==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-23T22:35:44Z","updated_at":"2020-04-23T22:37:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#

Currently adhocFilter object has 2 type: `SIMPLE` and `SQL`, and they are not _interchangeable_. For example, a SQL type adhocFilter with expression `ds < '2020-04-01'` doesn't convert to SIMPLE type with `ds`, `equals` and `2020-04-01` 3 parts. I think this is because many SQL cannot easily converted to those 3 pre-defined parts in Simple type. And for SQL type, its expression's subject doesn't have to be in the simple mode dropdown list.\r\n\r\nActually I did try to use simple mode before I create PARTITION tab. But because i saw a few cases in airbnb that partition columns are not in the simple mode columns list so i gave up.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/619165165/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/619200843","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/9646#issuecomment-619200843","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/9646","id":619200843,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxOTIwMDg0Mw==","user":{"login":"GiannisDimitriou","id":47314887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzE0ODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47314887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GiannisDimitriou","html_url":"https://github.com/GiannisDimitriou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GiannisDimitriou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GiannisDimitriou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GiannisDimitriou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GiannisDimitriou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GiannisDimitriou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GiannisDimitriou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GiannisDimitriou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GiannisDimitriou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GiannisDimitriou/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-24T19:29:59Z","updated_at":"2020-04-24T19:29:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@villebro
