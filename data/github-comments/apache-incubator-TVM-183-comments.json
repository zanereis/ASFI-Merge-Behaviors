I replied there.\r\n\r\nYours goes further than #5519  and I'll think through it a bit more. My initial reaction is that this looks ok but there is one aspect that we could pull in here from 5519 :\r\n \r\nThere is an appeal to keeping the number of inputs and outputs in the table and passing the input and output tensors to the helper functions seems to be high. It also seemed to me that the equality check could be done at the top level and any place where we had a range check we punted to the helper function as I had commented. I'll try and push out something the approach for something like conv2d.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/624679105/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/624695329","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/5526#issuecomment-624695329","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5526","id":624695329,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNDY5NTMyOQ==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-06T14:50:13Z","updated_at":"2020-05-06T14:50:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"cc

thanks for the review. I opened this at like 2:30am last night before going to bed. Will provide some more context.\r\n\r\nThe goal of my refactor to is to turn on the new C-ABI compatible object system in TVM. I started by trying to simplify the split between interfaces and better match TVM's linking model. I found some of the code using the low-level `ffi::{X, Y}` types and some using higher-level types, this first patch just combines the overlap without fully changing things to my liking as in not to break everything. \r\n\r\nWhat I first did is combine some overlapping code that I found in `tvm-frontend` and `tvm-common` and then have been working on rectifying the top-level layers. If you want to see end-to-end state you can see my WIP version at https://github.com/jroesch/tvm/tree/rust-fe. \r\n\r\nA cool not yet polished thing is the ability to write an out of tree Rust pass. See https://github.com/jroesch/tvm/tree/rust-fe/rust/out-of-tree. \r\n\r\nI would like to land the initial layers in tree so I can start to turn on CI and incrementally land instead of writing a single 10kloc PR. Hoping to do multiple passes on the naming, interface, etc. \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/624770902/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/624774462","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/5528#issuecomment-624774462","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5528","id":624774462,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNDc3NDQ2Mg==","user":{"login":"u99127","id":19559067,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTU5MDY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19559067?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/u99127","html_url":"https://github.com/u99127","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/u99127/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/u99127/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/u99127/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/u99127/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/u99127/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/u99127/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/u99127/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/u99127/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/u99127/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-06T17:10:18Z","updated_at":"2020-05-06T17:10:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the discussion and prompting this. I agree with you entirely with the motivation behind this  that we should look to simplify the frontend, the amount of copy pasting to add a new operator isn't ideal and reducing the complexity is a good thing. \r\n\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> I thought of adding all the op attributes in table/map but decorator seemed to be more pythonic.\r\n\r\nOk.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> Few more points to consider:\r\n> \r\n>     1. Sometimes equality checks can not be straight forward like num_inputs==input_tensors. In this case we can always set num_input check as None and handle assertion in the specific convert function.\r\n> \r\n\r\nThat seems to be equivalent to -1 in the other scheme . So if we can't handle it in the common case because it has variable number of inputs but greater than a particular number for instance we need to make an operator specific check.\r\n\r\nI guess my question is whether a single decorator would be able to handle the most common cases. At the end of the day my goal is to reduce code duplication as much as I can avoid it which is why the table driven approach helps but as you say it has it's limits especially with the cases you mention. \r\n\r\nFrom a very old branch of mine, here is a table with the operator, helper function, number of inputs , number of outputs : all of which are likely to need just an equality check for number of inputs and outputs.\r\n\r\n            'AVERAGE_POOL_2D': (self.convert_average_pool2d, 1, 1),\r\n            'SOFTMAX': (self.convert_softmax, 1, 1),\r\n            'SQUEEZE': (self.convert_squeeze, 1, 1),\r\n            'MAX_POOL_2D': (self.convert_max_pool2d, 1, 1),\r\n            'ADD': (self.convert_add, 2, 1),\r\n            'SUB': (self.convert_sub, 2, 1),\r\n            'MUL': (self.convert_mul, 2, 1),\r\n            'DIV': (self.convert_div, 2, 1),\r\n            'POW': (self.convert_pow, 2, 1),\r\n            'MAXIMUM': (self.convert_maximum, 2, 1),\r\n            'MINIMUM': (self.convert_minimum, 2, 1),\r\n            'GREATER': (self.convert_greater, 2, 1),\r\n            'LOGISTIC': (self.convert_logistic, 1, 1),\r\n            'TANH':(self.convert_tanh, 1, 1),\r\n            'RELU':(self.convert_relu, 1, 1),\r\n            'CAST': (self.convert_cast, 1, 1),\r\n            'TRANSPOSE_CONV': (self.convert_transpose_conv, 3, 1)\r\n\r\nas these have fixed number of input and output tensors.\r\n\r\nMy hunch is that we should be able to get to a single decorator for this sample set above falls out but I'd like to see what you think. Without working it out \r\n\r\nIf on the other hand we end up with multiple decorators per helper for each of these , then we end up with duplication of code again and copy-pastism which I think is what we both want to avoid.\r\n\r\n>     2. Need to check instead of passing input tensors can we pass Relay expressions. If input tensors are needed they can always be accessed using 'op' variable.\r\n> \r\n\r\nWhat would the relay expressions represent ? \r\n\r\n>     3. Need to check if there is a scope to add helper function for quantized params calculation.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I follow this one.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/624774462/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/624783943","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4312#issuecomment-624783943","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4312","id":624783943,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNDc4Mzk0Mw==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-06T17:28:15Z","updated_at":"2020-05-06T17:28:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"ping @kevinthesun @icemelon9 @yongwww please followup ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/624783943/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/624800522","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/5526#issuecomment-624800522","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5526","id":624800522,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNDgwMDUyMg==","user":{"login":"ehsanmok","id":6980212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5ODAyMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6980212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok","html_url":"https://github.com/ehsanmok","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-06T18:00:26Z","updated_at":"2020-05-06T20:13:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"These changes make good sense in general.

They were for general discussion.\r\n\r\nI think as far as code deduplication is considered both the approaches are fine. Both can achieve the same. The difference comes with the look and feel of it. And hence it is subjective and can be driven by personal choices. However, still, let me put a few pros of a decorator approach.\r\n-  Since it is more pythonic, new developers could easily relate to it.\r\n-  The decorator places all the attributes/properties of a particular op in a single view. For table based approach these are divided into two places - at table level and in the convert function.\r\n- The decorator intuitively lets you add pre and post-processing. For. ex. fusing activation functions to the output.\r\n\r\nLet me know your thoughts.\r\n\r\n\r\n> That seems to be equivalent to -1 in the other scheme\r\n\r\nOk.

Should we push back this conversion to a common code? Also a more generic implementation of conversion is added in this PR as get_tensor_expr function https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/pull/5528/files#diff-ee9a43edfb6fd0c9121e00c67c59ef43R2414.\r\n\r\n> I'm not sure I follow this one.\r\n\r\nI was thinking if we could somehow find some common code that will be a wrapper to code like below.

Thanks for the review.\r\nI work in a device with very limited ram availability. Actually even a few kbs is crucial for me.\r\n\r\nIm using a quantized model and the pool is 80% unit8 data. So i dont want to allocate all pool with float and 32bit. If i consider the bit i can restrict all pool to allocate 32bit.\r\n\r\nSo while allocating space, to compute `size` we either need `bits` or `dytpe`. Now both are not available in `TVMGraphRuntimePoolEntry`. So i added bits in `TVMGraphRuntimePoolEntry`\r\n\r\nAs you suggested, we can compute `size` while finding maximum space needed and save to  `pool_entry[sid].size` and remove the `bits`.\r\nBut it requires either \r\n1. while making TVMNDArray_Empty, always use `dtype.code = kDLInt` & `dtype.bits = 8`.\r\n\r\n2. while making TVMNDArray_Empty, use Float & 32bit (like before this change) and reduce the `size` as per `bits` and align to 4bytes.\r\n\r\nI would like to go with 2nd approach.
