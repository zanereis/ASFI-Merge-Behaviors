I was thinking about another case related to partitioning. It is not for user-friendliness but about supporting aggregations in the KStream DSL:\n1. KStream topology contains a bunch of high-level operations like Map, Filter, Join, Aggregate is translated into the lower-level Processor topology in runtime.\n2. To support groupBy-Aggregate, the current design is to use an intermediate Kafka topic to store aggregated values per partition, such that the aggregation operators can compute their own aggregates and send the update records to various partitions according to their aggregate key, and another \"merge\" operators that reads the update records per partition and merge the updates that were sent from different aggregation operations based on their own partitions.\n3. So this requires the translated topology to include a Sink node after the aggregation Operator node, which is able to send to different partitions according to their key. In common cases the default producer partitioner that does the murmur hashcode on the key should be fine, but we may want to choose a more advanced partitioner to reduce data skewness, etc.\n\nSo I am wondering, what scenarios would you require a specific partitioner for each topic, rather than a general partitioner that just guarantees same-key-goes-to-same-partition (like the default partitioner)? For now I feel it may be necessary for the end sink nodes, i.e. the Kafka topics that are the final outputs of Kafka Streams, but for intermediate topics they may not be required. \n\nOr if the original key is a combo of multiple fields (e.g. a GenericRecord of ServiceCallEventID) where the partitioning is only related to one of its field (e.g. string ServiceName inside ServiceCallEventID), then we can do a `map` operator to extract the fields first then `forward to sink`, but admittedly this requires storing the message with the enforced key in Kafka as well.\n\nThoughts?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/158569548/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/158611285","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/571#issuecomment-158611285","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/571","id":158611285,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1ODYxMTI4NQ==","user":{"login":"jinxing64","id":4058918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNTg5MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4058918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64","html_url":"https://github.com/jinxing64","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-21T08:04:00Z","updated_at":"2015-11-21T08:04:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@junrao

- I actually got the same failures locally that you see on EC2. I'm not entirely sure why this should happen. Lowering the throughput should make things better (and has done in other tests). There must be something deeper going on. I'll take a closer look tomorrow. \nOn the other point - ideally we'll get ourselves into a position where anyone can run these tests locally in a reliable manner. It's a bit difficult to use EC2 because of the feedback cycle being so slow. A build server that runs the 'local vm' version may be the best option, so we know these tests work run locally. But that will take some extra effort, and maybe hardware. We should consolidate on one way though if possible. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/158785802/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/158846864","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/309#issuecomment-158846864","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/309","id":158846864,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1ODg0Njg2NA==","user":{"login":"rhauch","id":84732,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84732?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch","html_url":"https://github.com/rhauch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-23T03:47:59Z","updated_at":"2015-11-23T03:47:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> So I am wondering, what scenarios would you require a specific partitioner for each topic, rather than a general partitioner that just guarantees same-key-goes-to-same-partition (like the default partitioner)? For now I feel it may be necessary for the end sink nodes, i.e. the Kafka topics that are the final outputs of Kafka Streams, but for intermediate topics they may not be required.\n\n@guozhangwang, one scenario that I run into frequently is to partition by subset of a hierarchical key. For example, if a key for a \"row\" or entity is composed of multiple hierarchical parts such as \"`<database>/<collection>/<group>/<row>`\", then a topic consumed by multiple instances of a stateful processor (with stateful local storage) requires message keys with the full ID so that the topics can be garbage collected. However, for scalability reasons there are multiple processor instances, and because they're stateful partitioning is required to ensure that, for example, all rows within a particular collection always go to the same processor instance. In that case, the partitioning would be based upon the \"`<database>/<collection>`\" part of the key. However, this is not universal: other services within the same system have their own processors and usually need different partitioning schemes (e.g., at the database level for billing, or even at the group level for notifications).\n\n> Or if the original key is a combo of multiple fields (e.g. a GenericRecord of ServiceCallEventID) where the partitioning is only related to one of its field (e.g. string ServiceName inside ServiceCallEventID), then we can do a map operator to extract the fields first then forward to sink, but admittedly this requires storing the message with the enforced key in Kafka as well.\n\nHandling partitioning via the topology/DSL seems to be a bit odd. Normally the topology deals with key-value pairs, and if part of the topology (e.g., a map node just before a sink) converted the key to a partition-able key then the message lost its original key. To do this, you'd need the topology to be able to track key-partitionkey-value triples, and that's pretty different than what Kafka Streams is doing (and likely overkill for many situations).\n\nIMO partitioning should be orthogonal to the topology structure, and it really should be determined at the sink. Thus, I'm still going to try to advocate for a solution like this PR.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/158846864/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/158853768","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/328#issuecomment-158853768","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/328","id":158853768,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1ODg1Mzc2OA==","user":{"login":"lindong28","id":5873403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NzM0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5873403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28","html_url":"https://github.com/lindong28","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-23T04:52:03Z","updated_at":"2015-11-23T04:54:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@guozhangwang Would you have time to review this patch? @onurkaraman has reviewed this patch. @jjkoshy would be on leave soon.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/158853768/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/158882958","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/573#issuecomment-158882958","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/573","id":158882958,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1ODg4Mjk1OA==","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-23T09:15:39Z","updated_at":"2015-11-23T09:15:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@fpj What do you think?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/158882958/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/158887465","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/573#issuecomment-158887465","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/573","id":158887465,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1ODg4NzQ2NQ==","user":{"login":"fpj","id":572920,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjkyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/572920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpj","html_url":"https://github.com/fpj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-23T09:33:49Z","updated_at":"2015-11-23T09:33:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM.

In `IntegrationTestHarness.setUp`, we need to call `producerSecurityConfigs` and `consumerSecurityConfigs` before we call `super.setUp`. The reason is that those calls populate the truststore file with the client certificates and `super.setUp` starts the brokers (which load the truststore file on start-up). It goes without saying that this is not obvious at all! With the suggested change, we don't need the CAroot changes anymore (we may still want them, but the tests pass without them).\n\n``` scala\n    val ps =
