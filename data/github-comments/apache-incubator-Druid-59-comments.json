We should use it very carefully not to make a mess. But, I believe there are still some useful usecases though. \n\nHere is my usecase. I want to attach my debugger to an IndexTask which is forked from a overlord or middle manager. However, IndexTasks often finish its job and the jvm terminates too quickly to attach my debugger to it. So I want to put off the execution of IndexTask until my debugger has got a connection to the forked jvm. Giving `suspend=y` as a jvm option of a child process works out this issue as it delays the execution of code and makes the main thread(I guess) wait for a debugger attachment. But, if I set this option in the overlord configurations, all the tasks forked from the overlord will be stuck waiting for the debugger attachment, which is not the situation I want.\n\n```\n\"context\": {\n    \"druid.indexer.runner.javaOpts\" : \"-server -Xmx4g -Xms4g -server -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=0.0.0.0:0,suspend=y\"\n  }\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/173971328/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/173982986","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/2320#issuecomment-173982986","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2320","id":173982986,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3Mzk4Mjk4Ng==","user":{"login":"drcrallen","id":8213081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMTMwODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8213081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen","html_url":"https://github.com/drcrallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-22T17:19:24Z","updated_at":"2016-01-22T17:20:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@CHOIJAEHONG1 Cool. once https://github.com/druid-io/druid/pull/2246 is done, I was hoping an extra feature to be able to add JVM modules in a \"better\" way, such that you could add things like the Debugger properties you mentioned, or enable jmxremote or other JVM level stuff.

Curator service discovery leaves a lot of turds lying around in ZK and has a whole bunch of extra junk in the znodes.  Also, the argument about replacing it.  Using Curator discovery is likely to make it significantly more difficult to replace this, where using `Announcer` will keep the surface area of announcement contained and simpler to replace.\n\nFwiw, I think that replacing the \"announcing\" of service availability is the simplest of the things to swap off of ZK.  After that, we can adjust the publishing logic (segment announcements).  So, keeping in mind that we hope to follow this up with an HTTP implementation of the Announcer in the not too distant future, I'd be more in favor of sticking with an interface we have more control over instead of expanding the scope of the removal of ZK to also force us to reimplement the entire curator service discovery interface.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/174605281/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/174606554","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/2327#issuecomment-174606554","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2327","id":174606554,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3NDYwNjU1NA==","user":{"login":"abbondanza","id":5099199,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTkxOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5099199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abbondanza","html_url":"https://github.com/abbondanza","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abbondanza/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abbondanza/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abbondanza/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abbondanza/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abbondanza/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abbondanza/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abbondanza/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abbondanza/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abbondanza/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-25T18:09:31Z","updated_at":"2016-01-25T18:09:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@fjy You got it!

@gianm, I am sorry that I did not reply to you straight away. I felt that I needed to wait for the new year for my feelings on the subject to brew.\n\nThere is nothing like TIME_PART in general SQL as far as I know BUT the in most SQLs there are two things:\n1. Lots and lots of basic time functions like (from: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/date-and-time-functions.html ):\n   - `MINUTE()` - MINUTE_OF_HOUR in my suggestion\n   - `HOUR()` - HOUR_OF_DAY in my suggestion\n   - `WEEKOFYEAR()` - WEEK_OF_YEAR in my suggestion\n2. Ability to compose those very easily with Maths `HOUR(d)*60+MINUTE(d) AS \"MINUTE_OF_DAY\"`\n\nIn Plywood/PlyQL I thought it would be cool to lump all of these together into one function and then extend it will all the logical X_OF_Y. I did not want to ask for an extraction function for every function supported by MySQL but that would be fine as well. I figured that a good API would be to have a `timePart` extraction function with whatever subset of time parting functions you think makes sense.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/174790922/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/174808553","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/2331#issuecomment-174808553","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2331","id":174808553,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3NDgwODU1Mw==","user":{"login":"himanshug","id":246308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjMwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug","html_url":"https://github.com/himanshug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-26T04:08:40Z","updated_at":"2016-01-26T04:08:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"ok,
