The code as is will work fine in distributed mode. The problem is when you're using the spout in an integration test, or are running the cluster in local mode for some other reason.\r\n\r\nWhen you're running an integration test in local mode, exceptions thrown by the executors are propagated to the testing code. If we don't catch and handle InterruptException the testing code has to handle this exception itself during shutdown. As far as I can tell (not sure though), the local mode code also stops shutting down executor threads once one of them throws an exception, so throwing exceptions from the spout might prevent other executor threads from being shut down. This is less of an issue if it only happens when a real error occurs, but it's not great if it happens randomly when this spout is shut down. Either way, there's no reason we shouldn't handle InterruptException internally in the spout instead of showing it to users.\r\n\r\nWe didn't do it in the old spout because the old spout would be throwing InterruptedException (the built-in Java exception), and not InterruptException (the Kafka-specific exception that Storm doesn't know about). So when the old spout shut down, any InterruptedException would be caught by the check here https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/storm-core/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/utils/Utils.java#L2181, which would let the cluster shut down cleanly. \r\n\r\nAbout the last line in my previous comment: The exception being wrapped is a new Java InterruptedException, not a Kafka InterruptException. The point is to convert the InterruptException, which is semantically identical to Java's InterruptedException, into a form so Storm will treat it like a normal InterruptedException (which it essentially is).

I can't speak to how much of an overhead and unpredictability there really is to making Kafka manage it though, but it's fine by me if we want to switch to manual management. I can't think of a good reason for supporting both manual and automatic assignment though. \r\n\r\nThe reason the old Kafka spout did manual assignment was that automatic assignment wasn't available on the old APIs as far as I know.\r\n\r\nI agree that we shouldn't have two variants of the spout, it just adds unnecessary complexity. I'd rather we just do a solid manual assignment implementation and get rid of the automatic code, if we need to switch.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that to be on par with automatic assignment manual assignment needs to support adding partitions without requiring a spout restart, and without the spout instances stepping on each others' toes (e.g. avoid partitions being assigned to two spout instances at once, even while reassigning).\r\n\r\n@hmcl Sure, it's more readable if strategies like this can be sectioned off in their own classes. If we really have to support both, I think it's nicer if assignment can be implemented through delegates rather than through subclassing.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/267399292/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/267408431","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1803#issuecomment-267408431","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1803","id":267408431,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NzQwODQzMQ==","user":{"login":"ptgoetz","id":260896,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDg5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/260896?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz","html_url":"https://github.com/ptgoetz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-15T18:49:02Z","updated_at":"2016-12-15T18:49:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"+1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/267408431/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/267408749","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1818#issuecomment-267408749","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1818","id":267408749,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NzQwODc0OQ==","user":{"login":"ptgoetz","id":260896,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDg5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/260896?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz","html_url":"https://github.com/ptgoetz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-15T18:50:22Z","updated_at":"2016-12-15T18:50:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"+1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/267408749/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/267412111","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1821#issuecomment-267412111","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1821","id":267412111,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NzQxMjExMQ==","user":{"login":"ptgoetz","id":260896,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDg5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/260896?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz","html_url":"https://github.com/ptgoetz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-15T19:04:05Z","updated_at":"2016-12-15T19:04:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"One
