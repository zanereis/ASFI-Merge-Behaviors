have to see what are the times savings of doing this.\n\nI think regardless the less time we spent building the none-whisk bits and instead pulling down the image it's better.\n\nBut to save manual maintenance  maybe we should have single repos for the go-cli image, and for swift3 image. Then configure docker hub to build an image automatically when a new commit get's merge into the image repo.\n\nAnother idea I discuss briefly with @dubeejw was to only build one go binary during travis. (linux/amd64). \nAlso maybe parametrized this thru ansible environments the binaries to be built, we just need to cover how to handle the tests for nginx
