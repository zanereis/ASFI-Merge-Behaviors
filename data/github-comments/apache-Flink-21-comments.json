This is not really helping the reviews and clutters the change history of files and hinders git blame. I know that some IDEs to that automatically, but it would be nice to deactivate that in the future. Why the hell some IDEs think that adding 100 changed lines to a file (where only one typo was fixed) would help is beyond me...\n\nMinor comment: The JoinDeadlock test creates a dedicated input format that does not do anything different then `ExecutionEnvironment#generateSequence` would do, if the source parallelism was set to one.\n\nSince the whitespace changes are hard to factor out, let's merge it this way, but really keep this in mind in the

@balidani, thanks a lot for the changes! I'll try to run some tests on a cluster soon and test the new version.\nI have a question about the graph coloring example. As far as I understand, in this algorithm, colors are represented by numbers (vertex values) and the goal is to color the graph with the minimum number of colors, so that no 2 neighboring vertices have the same color. So, in each superstep, each vertex gathers the colors of its neighbors in a set and then assigns itself the minimum color that isn't in this set. However, it seems to me that in your implementation, you're only propagating the minimum neighbor value, similar to what you would do in connected components. Is there anything I'm missing here?\nThanks!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/82588861/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/82605275","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/482#issuecomment-82605275","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/482","id":82605275,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyNjA1Mjc1","user":{"login":"hsaputra","id":105434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTQzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/105434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra","html_url":"https://github.com/hsaputra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-17T21:20:42Z","updated_at":"2015-03-17T21:20:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This is merged by @StephanEwen with http://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/flink/commit/72ca014e.\n\nThanks Stephan.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/82605275/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/82621443","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/474#issuecomment-82621443","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/474","id":82621443,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyNjIxNDQz","user":{"login":"rmetzger","id":89049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger","html_url":"https://github.com/rmetzger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-17T22:17:29Z","updated_at":"2015-03-17T22:17:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"First of all: Great work @gaborhermann! The whole Kafka connector code is well written and contains logic for a lot of cases. I think it was already quite some work to get it to the state it currently is.\n\nI took this pull request as a base to add an integration test which is starting a local Zookeeper and Kafka instance.\nI also fixed a critical issue in the streaming code, regarding exception forwarding.\n\nMy current WIP is here: https://github.com/rmetzger/flink/tree/kafka-gabor\n\nThe code needs some more care until its in a good state. The following is missing:\n- More integration tests: Testing of the `PersistentKafkaSource` with taskmanager failure and job restart, also tests for other stuff (partitioner as class & as instance)\n- Add means to `KafkaSource` and `KafkaSink` for users to pass their own configuration properties to Kafka.\n- There are some TODOs in the code\n- Testing of the code in a distributed setup.\n\nI'll work on the cluster testing tomorrow. In the course of that, I'm probably going to add more code to my \"wip\" branch.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/82621443/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/82625011","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/491#issuecomment-82625011","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/491","id":82625011,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyNjI1MDEx","user":{"login":"balidani","id":1805302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDUzMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1805302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/balidani","html_url":"https://github.com/balidani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balidani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balidani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balidani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balidani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balidani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balidani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balidani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balidani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balidani/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-17T22:30:19Z","updated_at":"2015-03-17T22:30:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi!\n\nI squashed them, I hope it's done correctly.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/82625011/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/82825369","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/488#issuecomment-82825369","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/488","id":82825369,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyODI1MzY5","user":{"login":"rmetzger","id":89049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger","html_url":"https://github.com/rmetzger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-18T08:53:34Z","updated_at":"2015-03-18T08:53:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you for the huge change!

me explain how I made out the relevant API facing methods to deprecate. Since I changed all calls to set the parallelism to `getParallelism` or `setParallelism` I did not have to change classes which already used these methods. To find the remaining which used `setDegreeOfParalleism` or `getDegreeOfParalleism` method, I did a regexp search in the Java and Scala classes: \n\nJava: `public .* (get|set)DegreeOfParallelism`\n\n`ExecutionConfig`\n`Operator`\n`CollectionEnvironment`\n`ExecutionEnvironment`\n`StreamExecutionEnvironment`\n`SpargelIteration`\n\nScala: `def (get|set)DegreeOfParallelism`\n\n`ExecutionEnvironment`\n`StreamExecutionEnvironment`\n\nIn these classes I deprecated the methods, and made them call the new methods `getParallelism` and `setParallelism`. That's how I verified this pull request is not API breaking. For you inspection, I've created a separate commit with these changes. The deprecated methods are also covered in the documentation about how to change the parallelism: http://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-master/programming_guide.html#parallel-execution\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/83433378/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/83438987","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/498#issuecomment-83438987","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/498","id":83438987,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzNDM4OTg3","user":{"login":"uce","id":1756620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTY2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1756620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce","html_url":"https://github.com/uce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-19T09:23:00Z","updated_at":"2015-03-19T09:23:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Regarding submission via `Client`: You are right.
