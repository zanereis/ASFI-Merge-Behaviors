Your PR sounds like its offering just about exactly what I'm looking for. My only two questions follow up questions are:\r\n\r\n1.) Can you confirm which release this commit went out in? It looks like it was merged on April 17th and I'm using a release (`0.32.0rc2`) that is marked April 19th but doesn't seem to include it. I'm assuming its availabe in `0.33.0rc1` and up?\r\n\r\n2.) Does `can_only_access_owned_queries` also block the list saved queries view dropdown (i.e. in the screenshot above) from seeing the full list of users? I was hoping to be able to block users from seeing who has Superset access in addition to preventing cross user saved queries searches.\r\n\r\nAssuming the 2nd item was also addressed in #7234, everything I was suggested would be covered and we can close this issue. If not, I will relabel this as a feature request and clarify that half of the request was already addressed in a newer release.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/505666815/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/505674515","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/7767#issuecomment-505674515","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/7767","id":505674515,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNTY3NDUxNQ==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-26T00:51:59Z","updated_at":"2019-06-26T00:51:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7767?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#7767](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7767?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/commit/5c58fd18026fa8ab947a8ff5985da469c84a6a6a?src=pr&el=desc) will **decrease** coverage by `0.14%`.\n> The diff coverage is `50%`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7767/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=KsB0fHcx6l&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7767?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@            Coverage Diff             @@\n##           master    #7767      +/-   ##\n==========================================\n- Coverage   65.71%   65.56%   -0.15%     \n==========================================\n  Files         459      459              \n  Lines       21981    21983       +2     \n  Branches     2415     2415              \n==========================================\n- Hits        14445    14414      -31     \n- Misses       7415     7448      +33     \n  Partials      121      121\n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7767?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [superset/db\\_engine\\_specs/base.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7767/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-c3VwZXJzZXQvZGJfZW5naW5lX3NwZWNzL2Jhc2UucHk=) | `87.98% <50%> (-0.33%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [superset/db\\_engine\\_specs/mysql.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7767/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-c3VwZXJzZXQvZGJfZW5naW5lX3NwZWNzL215c3FsLnB5) | `34.88% <0%> (-58.14%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [superset/models/core.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7767/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-c3VwZXJzZXQvbW9kZWxzL2NvcmUucHk=) | `83.02% <0%> (-0.62%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [superset/views/core.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7767/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-c3VwZXJzZXQvdmlld3MvY29yZS5weQ==) | `72.87% <0%> (-0.21%)` | :arrow_down: |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7767?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7767?src=pr&el=footer).

Wow, I can see that there was a lot of work done to fix the previous issues. One question: Will there be a regression if the option value is not specifically an object {table: ..., schema: ...}? I did not use fully-qualified table names. I just pulled out table and schema into separate properties in the parent object and it seems fine.

I went down the rabbit hole of using pre-insert and pre-update triggers to hash the table name for MySQL (which were then used for the uniqueness constraint) and then realized additionally different databases handles NULLs differently from a uniqueness standpoint, i.e., for MySQL and SQLite a unique index permits multiple NULL values for columns that can contain NULL which is problematic as the schema can be NULL and thus the following schema/table tuples aren't deemed to be unique: (`NULL`, `foo`), (`NULL`, `foo`). \r\n\r\nA work around was then to make a field comprising of full table name though this is extra overhead and potentially require per dialect trigger logic which is suboptimal as we support numerous dialects for the metadata datastore. \r\n\r\nIn the end I decided to add the logic in SQLAlchemy, i.e., between the engine and FAB's CRUD pre-add, pre-edit logic to ensure that these checks works globally. The one issue I'm running into is surfacing these exceptions in FAB's CRUD view; on add the exception is rendered (though the messaging is obfuscated, whereas when editing a table the exception is uncaught (see screenshots). \r\n\r\n@dpgaspar or @mistercrunch do you know how best to ensure FAB handles these exceptions and why the current behavior seems inconsistent between add and edit?\r\n\r\n#### ADD\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-06-26 at 1 52 36 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4567245/60215755-35775f80-981d-11e9-9989-0051e375a10c.png)\r\n\r\n#### EDIT\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-06-26 at 1 53 10 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4567245/60215756-35775f80-981d-11e9-8c9a-d066363ea7e5.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/506049105/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/506052007","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/7666#issuecomment-506052007","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/7666","id":506052007,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNjA1MjAwNw==","user":{"login":"smokemonster99","id":43358107,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzU4MTA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43358107?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smokemonster99","html_url":"https://github.com/smokemonster99","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smokemonster99/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smokemonster99/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smokemonster99/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smokemonster99/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smokemonster99/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smokemonster99/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smokemonster99/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smokemonster99/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smokemonster99/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-26T21:28:16Z","updated_at":"2019-06-26T21:28:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Here are 3 log files.\r\n[first-db-load-zero-loaded-from-cache.txt](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/files/3331960/first-db-load-zero-loaded-from-cache.txt)\r\nThis one is logs from a fresh load of the dashboard with no items in cache.
