I'm thinking If using `HoodieMetadataFileSystemView` in the end, the time cost of listing operation can be reduced a lot, besides, one replace operation usually doesn't contain many partitions, so maybe the time spent here can be acceptable(we can also make here run in parallel if there're many partitions affected)\r\n\r\nBy the way, maybe we can provide a basic/simple fix at least address the issue(duplicates is actually a critical issue), and try to improve this logic in the long term.\r\n\r\nDo you think it's worth a try?
