our experience on this change that is running in production for us, we can deploy a new SQL schema/lab with the usual mvn developer script, as well as upgrading the DB on schema changes. If a customization is needed, we should invert the way the upgrades are executed and do a package scan on classes rather than declaring them \"statically\" in `DatabaseUpgradeChecker`. It should help anyone to extend an upgrade class to add extra changes. The upgrade classes should declare themselves the version from which they should be run, and the DB version after the upgrade. With the help of a Comparable, we could sort them in the correct order, and even skip over unneeded ones if a class declares a bigger upgrade

 the concern expressed by @koushik-das  is already addressed in the change. Direct agents are affected with this. During the processing of Down event of management server, last ping time out gets reset. It is getting reset to a hardcoded 600 sec behind current time.  when ever the admin configures ping.interval, ping.timeout values such that  ping.interval*ping.timeout value crosses 600, the hosts misses the first few ping cycles creating this problem. So the hardcoded value is changed to make use of ping.interval*ping.timeout value. Hope this addresses your concerns\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/331828021/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/331847386","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/2225#issuecomment-331847386","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/2225","id":331847386,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMTg0NzM4Ng==","user":{"login":"borisstoyanov","id":13551960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTUxOTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13551960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov","html_url":"https://github.com/borisstoyanov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-25T10:59:53Z","updated_at":"2017-09-25T10:59:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@blueorangutan
