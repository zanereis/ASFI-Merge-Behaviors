So when _user impersonation_ is enabled, this _inbound_ or _client_ impersonation feature is also enabled.\n(2) I am going to use a variant of Jacques' suggestion for _inbound_ impersonation policies. I think `proxy_principals` and `target_principals` are apt. For example, an admin would setup policies by using:\n\n```\nALTER SYSTEM SET `exec.impersonation.inbound_policies` = '[\n  { proxy_principals  : { users : [ \"user0_1\"] },\n    target_principals : { users : [\"*\"] } },\n  { proxy_principals  : { groups : [\"group5_1\"] },\n    target_principals : { groups : [\"group4_2\"] } }\n]';\n```\n\nOverall, when impersonation is enabled, both _inbound_ impersonation and _outbound_ impersonation are  allowed.\n- _Inbound_ or _client_ impersonation: an authorized user can impersonate a target user, and the session user is set accordingly.\n- _Outbound_ or _storage plugin_ impersonation: Drill itself impersonates as the session user when interacting with storage plugins.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/192535617/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/192538620","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/400#issuecomment-192538620","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/400","id":192538620,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MjUzODYyMA==","user":{"login":"sudheeshkatkam","id":3272600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNzI2MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3272600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam","html_url":"https://github.com/sudheeshkatkam","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-05T00:42:22Z","updated_at":"2016-03-05T00:42:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jacques-n

More long-term, I would suggest that decimal values should be stored in a VariableWidthVector (which was assumed by VarLenghValuesColumn, hence the class cast exception).  This would use memory more efficiently when most values are far smaller than full precision, as is often the case (think java.math.BigDecimal, which operates this way).  Moreover, there would be no need to have a whole bunch of separate (generated) classes for different decimal precisions.  Just one class, variable width, handling any precision.  I also suggest that some other \"special cases\" could be combined.  Fixed width is a special case of variable width, where there's no need to store a separate length for each value.  Non-nullable is a special case of nullable, where there's no need to store a nullable boolean (or equivalent) for each value.  One last bit of feedback - it would be much easier to maintain the code if it did not involve generation of code (freemarker).  An old-fashioned class hierarchy, with no generated code, would probably work just fine for the vectoring mechanisms.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/192999951/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/193362442","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/410#issuecomment-193362442","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/410","id":193362442,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MzM2MjQ0Mg==","user":{"login":"jaltekruse","id":365366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTM2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/365366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaltekruse","html_url":"https://github.com/jaltekruse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaltekruse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaltekruse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaltekruse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaltekruse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaltekruse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaltekruse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaltekruse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaltekruse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaltekruse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-07T17:33:56Z","updated_at":"2016-03-07T17:33:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1

This PR has added an option to enable/disable the type inference feature (by default, it's enabled). \n2. Internal performance shows this type inference feature, combined with \"limit 0\" optimization,  shows huge improvement for \"limit 0\" query, some time with orders of magnitude. \n3. It has passed the pre-commit test with option enabled/disabled.\n4. It has addressed issues found by MapR QA folks during their extensive testing.\n5. @hsuanyi will add a doc to the JIRA, showing the scope where the type inference feature would or would not be applied.  \n6.

I think the second commit should be separate, and should be done as an inserted operator (similar to IteratorValidator), rather than modifying the constructor for Screen.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/199910572/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/199936054","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/439#issuecomment-199936054","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/439","id":199936054,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5OTkzNjA1NA==","user":{"login":"hsuanyi","id":4021621,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjE2MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4021621?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsuanyi","html_url":"https://github.com/hsuanyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsuanyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsuanyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsuanyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsuanyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsuanyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsuanyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsuanyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsuanyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsuanyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-22T17:52:12Z","updated_at":"2016-03-22T17:52:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jinfengni  can you help review?

you for the reviews.\n\nAll regression tests passed; I am running unit tests right now.\n\nNote that, the `planner.enable_limit0_optimization` option is disabled by default. To summarize (and document) the limitations:\n\nIf, during validation, the planner is able to resolve that the types of the columns (i.e. types are non late binding), the shorter execution path is taken. Some types are excluded:\n- DECIMAL type is not fully supported in general.\n- VARBINARY is not fully tested.\n- MAP, ARRAY are currently not exposed to the planner.\n- TINYINT, SMALLINT are defined in the Drill type system but have been turned off for now.\n- SYMBOL, MULTISET, DISTINCT, STRUCTURED, ROW, OTHER, CURSOR, COLUMN_LIST are Calcite types currently not supported by Drill, nor defined in the Drill type list.\n\nThree scenarios when the planner can do type resolution during validation:\n- Queries on Hive tables\n- Queries with explicit casts on table columns, example: `SELECT CAST(col1 AS BIGINT), ABS(CAST(col2 AS INTEGER)) FROM table LIMIT 0;`\n- Queries on views with casts on table columns\n\nIn the latter two cases, the schema of the query with LIMIT 0 clause has relaxed nullability compared to the query without the LIMIT 0 clause. Example:\nSay the schema definition of the Parquet file (`numbers.parquet`) is:\n\n```\nmessage Numbers {\n  required int col1;\n  optional int col2;\n }\n```\n\nSince the view definition does not specify nullability of columns, and schema of a parquet file is not yet leveraged by Drill's planner:\n\n```\nCREATE VIEW dfs.tmp.mynumbers AS SELECT CAST(col1 AS INTEGER) AS col1, CAST(col2 AS INTEGER) AS col2 FROM dfs.tmp.`numbers.parquet`;\n```\n\n(1) For query with LIMIT 0 clause, since the file/ metadata is not read, Drill assumes the nullability of both columns is [`columnNullable`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/sql/ResultSetMetaData.html#columnNullable).\n\n```\nSELECT col1, col2 FROM dfs.tmp.mynumbers LIMIT 0;\n```\n\n(2) For query without LIMIT 0 clause, since the file is read, Drill knows the nullability of `col1` is [`columnNoNulls`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/sql/ResultSetMetaData.html#columnNoNulls), and `col2` is [`columnNullable`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/sql/ResultSetMetaData.html#columnNullable).\n\n```\nSELECT col1, col2 FROM dfs.tmp.mynumbers LIMIT 1;\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/200026538/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/200290111","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/431#issuecomment-200290111","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/431","id":200290111,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwMDI5MDExMQ==","user":{"login":"vdiravka","id":11904420,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTA0NDIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11904420?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdiravka","html_url":"https://github.com/vdiravka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdiravka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdiravka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdiravka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdiravka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdiravka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdiravka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdiravka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdiravka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdiravka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-23T10:38:20Z","updated_at":"2016-03-23T10:38:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks Venki. \nYou are right, actually not all drill functions can accept VAR16CHAR as input.
