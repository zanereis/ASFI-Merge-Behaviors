Regenerators that require value-entry metadata accounting (such as access timestamp, individual entry hit count, etc.) may override `wrap()` to return a simple `SolrCache<K, V>` view of an underlying `SolrCache<K, MetadataWrapper<V>>` cache. It is the _raw_ cache (unwrapped) that is autowarmed, providing the regenerator with the information it needs to make warming decisions, etc. But it is the _wrapped_ cache that is presented for all normal cache interactions.\r\n\r\nThis approach works equally well for implementing more nuanced cache metrics (histograms, dumping cache contents, etc.). The overall approach is described in the [javadocs here](https://github.com/apache/solr/blob/b8124677d7c88b903b5f3c4fd24ca8a54596d215/solr/core/src/java/org/apache/solr/search/MetaCacheRegenerator.java#L36-L62). It should be quite trivial to implement regenerators that  implement custom metrics.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1738322438/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1738339806","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1958#issuecomment-1738339806","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1958","id":1738339806,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5nnPXe","user":{"login":"stillalex","id":61026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMDI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stillalex","html_url":"https://github.com/stillalex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stillalex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stillalex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stillalex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stillalex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stillalex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stillalex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stillalex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stillalex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stillalex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-28T02:11:02Z","updated_at":"2023-09-28T18:13:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"another set of failures, related to vector search\r\n\r\n```\r\n  - org.apache.solr.search.neural.KnnQParserTest.highDimensionFloatVectorField_shouldSearchOnThatField (:solr:core)\r\n    Test output: /Users/alexdeparvu/git/solr/solr/solr/core/build/test-results/test/outputs/OUTPUT-org.apache.solr.search.neural.KnnQParserTest.txt\r\n    Reproduce with: gradlew :solr:core:test --tests \"org.apache.solr.search.neural.KnnQParserTest.highDimensionFloatVectorField_shouldSearchOnThatField\" -Ptests.jvms=5 \"-Ptests.jvmargs=-XX:TieredStopAtLevel=1 -XX:+UseParallelGC -XX:ActiveProcessorCount=1 -XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=120m\" -Ptests.seed=293C1EA1098E2343 -Ptests.file.encoding=US-ASCII\r\n\r\n  - org.apache.solr.search.neural.KnnQParserTest.highDimensionByteVectorField_shouldSearchOnThatField (:solr:core)\r\n    Test output: /Users/alexdeparvu/git/solr/solr/solr/core/build/test-results/test/outputs/OUTPUT-org.apache.solr.search.neural.KnnQParserTest.txt\r\n    Reproduce with: gradlew :solr:core:test --tests \"org.apache.solr.search.neural.KnnQParserTest.highDimensionByteVectorField_shouldSearchOnThatField\" -Ptests.jvms=5 \"-Ptests.jvmargs=-XX:TieredStopAtLevel=1 -XX:+UseParallelGC -XX:ActiveProcessorCount=1 -XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=120m\" -Ptests.seed=293C1EA1098E2343 -Ptests.file.encoding=US-ASCII\r\n\r\n  - org.apache.solr.schema.DenseVectorFieldTest.indexing_highDimensionalityVectorDocument_shouldBeIndexed (:solr:core)\r\n    Test output: /Users/alexdeparvu/git/solr/solr/solr/core/build/test-results/test/outputs/OUTPUT-org.apache.solr.schema.DenseVectorFieldTest.txt\r\n    Reproduce with: gradlew :solr:core:test --tests \"org.apache.solr.schema.DenseVectorFieldTest.indexing_highDimensionalityVectorDocument_shouldBeIndexed\" -Ptests.jvms=5 \"-Ptests.jvmargs=-XX:TieredStopAtLevel=1 -XX:+UseParallelGC -XX:ActiveProcessorCount=1 -XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=120m\" -Ptests.seed=293C1EA1098E2343 -Ptests.file.encoding=US-ASCII\r\n```\r\n\r\nthese are caused by the new Codel level check (https://github.com/apache/lucene/pull/12436) and it's a difficult fix because Lucene95HnswVectorsFormat's getMaxDimensions method is final.

I saw a few challenges with a more generic approach:\r\n* how to convey that for non-float and non-double doc value types the post-processing is available but for float and double doc value types it is not available?\r\n* how to convey that for non doc value types the post-processing in not available? or how to make it available?\r\n* if making post-processing available more widely, is there a use case for it and how to avoid confusion with the normalisation that can be used at the model level? -- https://solr.apache.org/guide/solr/latest/query-guide/learning-to-rank.html#normalizer\r\n\r\nSo having _doc values_ and _date_ in the name, somehow, addresses those challenges and also leaves the door open for `readNumericDocValues[Float,Double,...]` additions in future if there's a use case.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1740672315/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1741013117","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1954#issuecomment-1741013117","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1954","id":1741013117,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5nxcB9","user":{"login":"epugh","id":22395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh","html_url":"https://github.com/epugh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-29T14:47:43Z","updated_at":"2023-09-29T14:47:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Okay, I'd love some review on this, I think it's more or less ready!

❗ **Naming Emergency** ❗ ❗ \r\n\r\nMany v2 APIs are currently offered at two paths based on whether a user is providing a core or a collection name.  For example, schema APIs are available at both `/collections/techproducts/schema` and `/cores/techproducts_shard1_replica_n1/schema`\r\n\r\nTrying to define these APIs concisely puts us in the awkward place of needing a generic term for either a core or a collection.\r\n\r\nSo far in this PR I've made due with \"index\", but I'm not terribly happy with it.  This choice appears in a few places:\r\n\r\n- JAX-RS annotations e.g. `@Path(\"/{indexType:collections|cores}/{indexName}/schema\")`\r\n- Committed Java code (mostly constants) e.g. `public static final String INDEX_NAME_PATH_PARAMETER = \"indexName\";`\r\n- Generated SolrRequest classes e.g. `public GetSchemaName(IndexType indexType, String indexName) { ... }`\r\n\r\nIt's a somewhat consequential naming decision, as it'll recur in the generated SolrJ code for most of our per core-or-collection APIs: `/schema`, `/config`, `/select`, `/update`, etc.\r\n\r\nDo we already have some generic term to refer to a core or collection?  Does anyone have any good ideas?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1747451445/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1747488065","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1978#issuecomment-1747488065","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1978","id":1747488065,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5oKI1B","user":{"login":"epugh","id":22395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh","html_url":"https://github.com/epugh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-04T19:13:26Z","updated_at":"2023-10-04T19:13:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"`corllection` ?
