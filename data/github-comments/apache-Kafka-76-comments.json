I'm okay both ways and will wait for @junrao's feedback.\n\nRegarding the unit tests, I'm trying to wrap my head around how to write them with proper mocking. You can see [here](https://github.com/vahidhashemian/kafka/compare/KAFKA-3144...vahidhashemian:KAFKA-3144-WITH-UNIT-TESTS?expand=1) how I've made changes to the last patch so the `OutputWriter` trait that you suggested is used. The issue now is I don't see clearly how to write the unit tests with mocking (for example, for `--describe` the main functionality is inside the protected `describeGroup()` method). This tells me perhaps further restructuring is required to make the command properly mockable, but I wanted to ask your opinion before heading down that road.

There are a couple similar issues that may be worth addressing here. The subscribe() which takes a `Pattern` looks like it doesn't have a null check, which may be OK for correctness (not 100% sure), but probably not what the user had in mind. Also, in assign(), we would currently raise an NPE if null was included among the topic partitions. Might be worth raising illegal argument for consistency (and to give the user a better message).
