Is it sufficient to call shutdown on the worker object from do-executor-heartbeats?</p>\n\n<p>    I'm not really sure what Constants/SYSTEM_EXECUTOR_ID is for? Should it be ignored when checking for hanging executors?</p>\n\n<p>    I'm hoping to add the zookeeper/metrics logging and shutdown functionality soon if the idea of this PR is sound.</p>\n\n<p>You can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:</p>\n\n<p>    $ git pull <a href=\"https://github.com/srdo/storm\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/srdo/storm</a> <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-956\" title=\"When the execute() or nextTuple() hang on external resources, stop the Worker&#39;s heartbeat\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-956\"><del>STORM-956</del></a></p>\n\n<p>Alternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1209.patch\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1209.patch</a></p>\n\n<p>To close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch<br/>\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:</p>\n\n<p>    This closes #1209</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>commit c0d1c4ef6ae0d1e144f5af85174d68d5a93eb06a<br/>\nAuthor: chuanlei <nichuanlei@126.com><br/>\nDate:   2015-07-22T07:37:28Z</p>\n\n<p>    stop worker heartbeat, when the executor threads hang-on</p>\n\n<p>commit 16980a3e4e015865348afee7661157cc9a21525a<br/>\nAuthor: chuanlei <nichuanlei@gmail.com><br/>\nDate:   2015-07-22T08:55:39Z</p>\n\n<p>    add the setup-check! to mk-threads</p>\n\n<p>commit 9884c578fe8fa85197b1e5d4118598425160bb3f<br/>\nAuthor: Stig Døssing <stigdoessing@gmail.com><br/>\nDate:   2016-03-13T14:57:27Z</p>\n\n<p>    Merge branch 'master' of <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm</a> into <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-956\" title=\"When the execute() or nextTuple() hang on external resources, stop the Worker&#39;s heartbeat\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-956\"><del>STORM-956</del></a></p>\n\n<p>commit 9dd030396b0d921f25c5269e17c58b649387211d<br/>\nAuthor: Stig Døssing <stigdoessing@gmail.com><br/>\nDate:   2016-03-13T18:58:29Z</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-956\" title=\"When the execute() or nextTuple() hang on external resources, stop the Worker&#39;s heartbeat\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-956\"><del>STORM-956</del></a>: Add support for warning about hanging executors</p>\n\n<p>commit af0a56df27f6d4765dd868cf85c0633832cd8a72<br/>\nAuthor: Stig Døssing <stigdoessing@gmail.com><br/>\nDate:   2016-03-14T20:45:12Z</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-956\" title=\"When the execute() or nextTuple() hang on external resources, stop the Worker&#39;s heartbeat\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-956\"><del>STORM-956</del></a>: Put hang check in its own function, added worker shutdown call, scheduled hang check interval to match lowest configured timeout.</p>\n\n<p>commit 9bb475213b18d1bbac9277f04dba8381e7a2fa2a<br/>\nAuthor: Stig Døssing <stigdoessing@gmail.com><br/>\nDate:   2016-03-15T19:29:00Z</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-956\" title=\"When the execute() or nextTuple() hang on external resources, stop the Worker&#39;s heartbeat\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-956\"><del>STORM-956</del></a>: Log error in Zookeeper when executor is hanging</p>\n\n<p>commit 1a7fd227eade0c205acc1a23aa80ce3e3b845818<br/>\nAuthor: Stig Døssing <sdo@it-minds.dk><br/>\nDate:   2016-03-18T12:03:21Z</p>\n\n<p>    Merge branch 'master' of <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm</a> into <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-956\" title=\"When the execute() or nextTuple() hang on external resources, stop the Worker&#39;s heartbeat\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-956\"><del>STORM-956</del></a></p>\n\n<p>commit 159a169e2cdf475fb69a3895fc354b9729d0bb6f<br/>\nAuthor: Stig Døssing <sdo@it-minds.dk><br/>\nDate:   2016-03-20T09:14:46Z</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-956\" title=\"When the execute() or nextTuple() hang on external resources, stop the Worker&#39;s heartbeat\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-956\"><del>STORM-956</del></a>: Added support for extending hang timeout via outputcollectors.

bound. Metric tick is in same queue as the input tuples from spout. If processing input tuples is slow, it may take much more to generate metrics and call getValueAndReset and thus `System.currentTimeMillis() - _bucketStart` is more than 10 minutes. </p>\n\n<p>You can
