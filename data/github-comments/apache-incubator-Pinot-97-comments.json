Also, we are still dealing with the v3 change that was recently made.\r\n\r\nFWIW, I think either DataTable should not have been exposed outside of Pinot, or it should have been treated as an external interface that should not be changed in backward incompatible way.

We already ran into this issue when you did the v2 to v3 upgrade. Even though this might be thought of as internal Pinot data structure, there are connectors that use this data table, making it an externally exposed data structure, and we need to be careful with incrementing version numbers in backward incompatible way.\r\n\r\nAgreed. I think the current blocker is that both v3/v4 are not part of the 0.7.1 release, so there is no way for external dependencies to upgrade. Ideally, this feature should be checked in for 1 or 2 releases then we can make the switch.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/881153648/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/881186933","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/7026#issuecomment-881186933","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/7026","id":881186933,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c40hdh1","user":{"login":"snleee","id":27253407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MjUzNDA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27253407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/snleee","html_url":"https://github.com/snleee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snleee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snleee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snleee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snleee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snleee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snleee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snleee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snleee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snleee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-16T05:26:25Z","updated_at":"2021-07-16T05:27:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@KKcorps Can you add the document something similar to https://docs.pinot.apache.org/basics/data-import/pinot-stream-ingestion/amazon-kinesis\r\n\r\nDo you need another check from @kishoreg?

I believe we do need this optimization, so adding something in the protocol (or, maybe adding a capability handshake in the beginning?) is workable.  Note that adding this in the beginning will mean adding a config to the broker to go ahead and use v2,v3,v4 in its requests. Since we upgrade brokers first, this will also mean  for the server to look (for each request) which version it needs to return with, and exception if it does not support that version (for a robust protocol design). It is also possible for the server to indicate its support in zookeeper under its instance config, and the broker can cache it on a per server basis along with the routing table. Either handshake or zk seems to be a workable solution, probably better than adding something in every query path.\r\n\r\nCan we also consider adding an spi interface for datatable, and have the trino/presto community make a one-time move to use that instead? Over time, we can support the concept of a session, and retain such things at session level rather than every query.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/881570533/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/881570987","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/7167#issuecomment-881570987","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/7167","id":881570987,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c40i7Sr","user":{"login":"mcvsubbu","id":2279037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzkwMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2279037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu","html_url":"https://github.com/mcvsubbu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-16T16:28:04Z","updated_at":"2021-07-16T16:28:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"FWIW.

Perhaps you can start with a proposal?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/882704506/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/882707232","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/7178#issuecomment-882707232","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/7178","id":882707232,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c40nQsg","user":{"login":"jtao15","id":50065407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMDY1NDA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50065407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtao15","html_url":"https://github.com/jtao15","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtao15/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtao15/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtao15/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtao15/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtao15/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtao15/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtao15/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtao15/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtao15/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-19T17:00:18Z","updated_at":"2021-07-19T17:00:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@snleee ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/882707232/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/882711007","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/7167#issuecomment-882711007","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/7167","id":882711007,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c40nRnf","user":{"login":"mqliang","id":12423751,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDIzNzUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12423751?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mqliang","html_url":"https://github.com/mqliang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mqliang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mqliang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mqliang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mqliang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mqliang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mqliang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mqliang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mqliang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mqliang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-19T17:05:14Z","updated_at":"2021-07-19T17:05:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"test failed due to flaky issue. close and re-open to trigger a re-run","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/882711007/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/882714584","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/7004#issuecomment-882714584","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/7004","id":882714584,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c40nSfY","user":{"login":"mcvsubbu","id":2279037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzkwMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2279037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu","html_url":"https://github.com/mcvsubbu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-19T17:10:10Z","updated_at":"2021-07-19T17:10:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sorry, there was no discussion in the slack channel after I got added to it.

If something needs to be in seconds (or even lower) chances are that the default values will work, and hardly anyone will change it. So, ew don't need to add extra code to introduce new config and deprecate old one, etc. Not to mention someone setting a very high value and maybe causing other things to break.\r\n\r\nYes @mcvsubbu actually I was my thought process along the lines of keeping the configuration consistent - That is, even if we always expect a config in seconds, and the user say gives 2m as the config, we convert it to 120s and use it. But your points show this can be fragile.

In fact, we are experimenting with something that we will put out a PR on soon.\r\n\r\nI am clearly not a +1000, I am curious what the others in PPMC (or even community) think about adding a feature like this. If implemented, it has to be done very carefully to make sure no extra  garbage is generated even when the feature is turned off (needless to say, it has to be a configurable feature).\r\n\r\nI am not sure I fully understand the UDF/real column that you propose, but it sounds promising, and should be looked at. Are you proposing to use a special decoder? We can extend the stream interface to include such UDFs, so that the underlying implementation may decide to populate such columns using such a decoder.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to consider is whether this can be done sparsely (i.e. sample every so many records).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/884336631/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/884337918","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/7004#issuecomment-884337918","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/7004","id":884337918,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c40tez-","user":{"login":"mcvsubbu","id":2279037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzkwMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2279037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu","html_url":"https://github.com/mcvsubbu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-21T16:50:12Z","updated_at":"2021-07-21T16:50:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> +1\r\n> \r\n> Other systems like Presto support these kind of features. https://prestodb.io/docs/current/connector/kafka-tutorial.html\r\n> \r\n> e.g.\r\n> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13425258/126526785-2cfaea4c-2699-4b75-a93a-2696404fcf28.png)\r\n> \r\n> All columns with the underscore prefix are ingested by default.

From what I gather, having a separate decoder that gets plugged in only when feature is enabled could be a way to go.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/884357812/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/884367275","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/7004#issuecomment-884367275","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/7004","id":884367275,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c40tl-r","user":{"login":"npawar","id":19693933,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjkzOTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19693933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar","html_url":"https://github.com/npawar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-21T17:36:29Z","updated_at":"2021-07-21T17:36:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I also think this will be very useful, especially for debugging.\r\nSeveral times we see users who think the consumers are lagging, or stuck.

I am assuming this would involve something like a UUID generator that will tack on UUID with each row that is ingested (?) In the second case, it seems like you are looking for a \"rowid\" with the additional criteria that it should be monotonically increasing and be comparable.\r\n\r\nI am not quite sure if it is possible to do both with reasonable amount of effort (i.e generate a globally unique identifier that is monotonically increasing and hence also comparable across all rows of all segments) specially when one considers that we commonly replace segments, generate segments offline, and also do some update operations such as UPSERT. Unless I am missing something, maybe it could be done with a cluster wide id generation service in Pinot (?). The first (UUID generation) can probably be done now at ingestion time using an ingestion transform function (?). The second looks very difficult to implement and get right (?).\r\n\r\nI think we need more clarity on what exactly is being implemented here: 1) dynamically generated ROWID over resultset only (for supporting cursors), 2) a column that will identify each row with a globally unique identifier (useful for partitioning, indexing, etc), 3) ROWID generated for each row at row creation time that is globally unique and comparable across all rows and all segments and that can be kept up to date with operations such as segment replacement, UPSERT, etc?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/884523925/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/884557966","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/7186#issuecomment-884557966","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/7186","id":884557966,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c40uUiO","user":{"login":"bilalmunir","id":916888,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxNjg4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/916888?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bilalmunir","html_url":"https://github.com/bilalmunir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bilalmunir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bilalmunir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bilalmunir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bilalmunir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bilalmunir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bilalmunir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bilalmunir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bilalmunir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bilalmunir/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-21T23:17:43Z","updated_at":"2021-07-21T23:17:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I think it'll be nice to document what these features are (that require these to be `public)`.

I think there are two issues:\r\n- ZK connection is not being closed (as you pointed out)\r\n- The client in your case is perhaps opening one ZK connection per query. This is highly inefficient. At this point I am unclear on whether the same pinot client could be used across multiple threads. But assuming it cannot, the next best today would be to maintain one connection per thread in the executor service, and reuse it for all queries that the thread fires. Ideally, this should be part of pinot java client itself.\r\n\r\n@ramabme Could you please investigate:\r\n- The ZK connection issue\r\n- If connection is thread/safe or not, to be used by multiple

The offset for each partition in a Kafka topic is unique. Combined with the partition ID, you can uniquely identify a row in a Pinot table.
