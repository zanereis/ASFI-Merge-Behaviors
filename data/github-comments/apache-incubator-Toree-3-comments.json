It's been awhile since the lazy Spark Context initialization support was added. Clearly, the shutdown doesn't report any problem with the Spark Context being null because it's wrapped in a `Try` that tosses any errors. The question is, \"Do we want to remove the code or add back support for shutting down the Spark Context when the JVM is being shutdown?\" Since it doesn't seem to be needed, I'm in favor of merging in this PR that just removes the failing code inside the shutdown hook.\n\n@lbustelo, @Lull3rSkat3r, thoughts?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-toree/issues/comments/224140958/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-toree/issues/comments/224300763","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-toree/pull/48#issuecomment-224300763","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-toree/issues/48","id":224300763,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNDMwMDc2Mw==","user":{"login":"Lull3rSkat3r","id":1383927,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODM5Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1383927?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lull3rSkat3r","html_url":"https://github.com/Lull3rSkat3r","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lull3rSkat3r/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lull3rSkat3r/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lull3rSkat3r/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lull3rSkat3r/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lull3rSkat3r/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lull3rSkat3r/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lull3rSkat3r/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lull3rSkat3r/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lull3rSkat3r/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-07T14:36:59Z","updated_at":"2016-06-07T14:36:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"There is a discussion about if stop is import on the [Spark Mailing List](http://apache-spark-user-list.1001560.n3.nabble.com/SparkContext-stop-td17826.html).
