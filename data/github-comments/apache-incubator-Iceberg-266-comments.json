But the implementations are changing and had public builders as well.\r\n\r\nIt's a mess up on my part and I should have noticed this when `@Value.Immutable` usage was added to `iceberg-api`.

I think, the syntax is rather self-explaining, saying \"Jackson 2.13 -> requires a version >= 2.13 and < 2.14 -> prefer 2.13.4\".\r\n\r\nOverall I think that having the single version catalog is a great improvement here, especially that really all versions are managed there.\r\n\r\nNow, let's hope that dependabot is happy with it as well.\r\n\r\nMaybe you can push your branch to your fork's `master` branch and let dependabot run against it?

At the same time, Iceberg metadata already forms a system table which we query in a distributed manner (`data_files`, etc), it is similar to having a separate table for metadata. If I remember correctly, one benefit of BigQuery is that it does not have to bring back the results while doing this distributed planning but that's on Spark side to provide that functionality. In my view, it is less likely one would query 20 PB of data in a single job and when that happens, it is unlikely to be a problem to spend 30 seconds planning the job.\r\n\r\nAt this point, we are not storing large blobs in the manifests so we will come back to that paper while discussing how to support secondary indexes and how to integrate that into planning. That would be the point when the metadata would be too big. Right now, we are talking about 2-4 GB of metadata to cover 20-40 PB of data.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1645972945/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1646087242","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/8066#issuecomment-1646087242","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/8066","id":1646087242,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85iHUxK","user":{"login":"chennurchaitanya","id":24554112,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTU0MTEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24554112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chennurchaitanya","html_url":"https://github.com/chennurchaitanya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chennurchaitanya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chennurchaitanya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chennurchaitanya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chennurchaitanya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chennurchaitanya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chennurchaitanya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chennurchaitanya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chennurchaitanya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chennurchaitanya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-21T18:25:53Z","updated_at":"2023-07-21T18:30:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"i ran rewriteDataFiles/compaction from spark , it created big files and left small files.
