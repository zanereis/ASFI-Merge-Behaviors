Then the master process spawns n worker processes in which `_started` remains `True`. So the necessary reporting threads will not be created here and nothing will be sent to `oap`.\r\n> \r\n> Commenting this [line](https://github.com/apache/skywalking-python/blob/11a74be39b07d55290c2df3de2b499bb126de048/skywalking/bootstrap/loader/sitecustomize.py#L147) preventing initialization inside the master process, then each worker processes will have its own Agent initialized successfully.\r\n\r\nThank you, I see where the problem is, maybe adding PID info to the `__started` flag so upon fork we can allow a safe restart.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/1308948811/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/1309746732","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/9937#issuecomment-1309746732","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/9937","id":1309746732,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArmls85OESYs","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-10T04:16:14Z","updated_at":"2022-11-10T04:16:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Please fix conflicts and make CI running :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/1309746732/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/1309846515","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/9937#issuecomment-1309846515","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/9937","id":1309846515,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArmls85OEqvz","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-10T06:48:56Z","updated_at":"2022-11-10T06:48:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Is PG e2e having some issue?
