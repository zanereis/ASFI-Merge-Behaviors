Sounds fair enough. I wasn't pointing fingers, just wanted to understand the thought process a bit better. \n\nJust to explicit what I meant by the difference between prepending and adding. The payload is constructed of a `wrapper` which is basically a `byte` and a `mimetype` at this point for binary payloads. And a `message` to be deserialized (via `GraphSONMessageSerializer`, `GryoMessageSerializer`, etc.). \nPrepending is basically adding the mechanism to the `wrapper`.\nAdding would be including it in the `message` as an argument. Along side the `sasl` credential argument for example (or some other variation)\n\nThe difference here is that with the curent implementation, existing drivers will need to be upgraded to support this feature change in the payload, along the lines of the changes you made in this PR on the Java Driver. \n\nThe first point here is that this can be an issue with drivers that separate the `wrapper` building logic from the `message` building. ie: the `wrapper` is always built the same way and reused for all operations. Adding the mechanism for _only_ the authentication `message` becomes a special use case in the `wrapper`. Depending on the implementation this can either get ugly, or be less trivial than expected. (`PHP`, `javascript` and `python` drivers fall in this category. Though looking at the python driver the change would be relatively small)\n\nThe second point is that if the mechanism were included as a `message` argument instead, then most drivers out there either already support this feature or have mechanisms in place to extend authentication `message` building. So we basically provide the feature keys in hand for users of those drivers. And if the drivers really have no support for what was just mentioned, it's a trivial upgrade. \n\nI tried to keep this clear but it's not one of my fortes.

We refer to all of this generated code as `gremlin-python` but there's actually two distinct sets of classes at play - one that works directly with the JVM and one that creates groovy scripts for submission over `RemoteConnection`. Seems like there should be some distinction in naming there whether at the class level or the module level.

don't think you need to put as may interrupt checks. Most steps inherit from `AbstractStep` and thus, if `AbstractStep.next()` and `AbstractStep.hasNext()` have the interrupt check, then all the `processNextStart()` in subclasses don't need to check for the interrupt. This should greatly reduce the amount of classes touched and requirements on providers with their own step implementations. In short, they just need to make sure they extend `AbstractStep`.

I was surprised to see that much difference between `compile()` and `eval()`. `eval()` ultimately calls compile but does cache the compile script for future use. I would have thought that would have narrowed the gap you managed to get between the two calls. There's a fair bit of code in `eval()` that gets executed with or without the cache as compared to `compile` so perhaps that has something to do with it.  As the execution here is about usage of the same script over and over there is little need for `eval()` so this change makes sense to me.\n\nI will only note that this forces the `ScriptEngine` we use to for `ScriptRecordReader` to implement `Compileable`. Not all implementations do that and it is not a required interface to the best of my recollection. That probably doesn't matter too much as we've currently hardcoded the groovy script engine in here.\n\nRan `mvn clean install` to success.\n\nVOTE +1\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/218128585/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/218174710","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/307#issuecomment-218174710","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/307","id":218174710,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxODE3NDcxMA==","user":{"login":"dmill-bz","id":1415875,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTU4NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1415875?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmill-bz","html_url":"https://github.com/dmill-bz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmill-bz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmill-bz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmill-bz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmill-bz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmill-bz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmill-bz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmill-bz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmill-bz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmill-bz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-10T14:28:30Z","updated_at":"2016-05-10T14:28:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"`mvn clean install` runs for me as well and the changes make sense. :) \n\nVOTE +1\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/218174710/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/218266032","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/310#issuecomment-218266032","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/310","id":218266032,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxODI2NjAzMg==","user":{"login":"okram","id":148925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODkyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/148925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram","html_url":"https://github.com/okram","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-10T19:34:29Z","updated_at":"2016-05-10T19:34:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"CHANGELOG\n\n```\n* `GraphFilter` helper methods are now more intelligent when determining edge direction/label legality.\n* Added `GraphFilterStrategy` to automatically construct `GraphFilters` via traversal introspection.\n```\n\nUPDATE\n\n```\nGraphFilter and GraphFilterStrategy\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n`GraphFilter` has been significantly advanced where the determination of an edge direction/label legality is more stringent.

I'm running Gephi 0.9.1 on Mac. Applying the layout and fiddling with the viz properties worked fine.\n\nRunning the visual traversal didn't seem to do anything. I didn't see any event changes flowing through the graph. Here's is the Gremlin Console for those steps:\n\n```\ngremlin> :remote config visualTraversal graph\n==>Connection to Gephi - http://localhost:8080/workspace2 with stepDelay:1000, startRGBColor:[0.0, 1.0, 0.5], colorToFade:g, colorFadeRate:0.7, startSize:3.0,sizeDecrementRate:0.33\ngremlin> traversal = g.V(2).in().out('knows').has('age', gt(30)).outE('created').has('weight', gt(0.5d)).inV();null\n==>null\ngremlin> :> traversal\n==>v[5]\n==>false\n```\n\nSome other comments for the docs:\n1. The default workspace is now `workspace1`. This should be updated in a couple spots.\n2. In the traversal example, the trailing `;null` is important to prevent the auto-iteration, right? If so, the docs should call this out specifically as a footnote.\n3. `visualTraversal` should appear in the `:remote config` parameters table.\n4. There doesn't seem to be a good way to see the existing configuration values. `:remote config visualTraversal graph` displays all config values (except `visualTraversal`), but maybe it might be better if for example `:remote config workspace` with no arguments would return the current value.\n5. Along the same lines, `:remote config help` might be nice to let the user know what parameters can be configured.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/218965743/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/219009355","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/312#issuecomment-219009355","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/312","id":219009355,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxOTAwOTM1NQ==","user":{"login":"dkuppitz","id":572377,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjM3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/572377?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz","html_url":"https://github.com/dkuppitz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-13T10:38:06Z","updated_at":"2016-05-13T10:38:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"`docker/build.sh -t -i -n` succeeded.\n\nVOTE: +1\n\nBtw., nice code snippet in the docs.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/219009355/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/219033703","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/312#issuecomment-219033703","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/312","id":219033703,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxOTAzMzcwMw==","user":{"login":"okram","id":148925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODkyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/148925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram","html_url":"https://github.com/okram","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-13T12:50:29Z","updated_at":"2016-05-13T12:50:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"```\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[INFO] Reactor Summary:\n[INFO]\n[INFO] Apache TinkerPop ..................................

I didn't see any event changes flowing through the graph. \n\nYou are using \"g\" to spawn your `Traversal`. You need to use \"vg\" which was created by the previous command. I made that more clear in the documentation. It is actually documented in the `visualTraversal` config option (see below)\n\n> 1. The default workspace is now workspace1. This should be updated in a couple spots.\n\nfixed\n\n> 1. In the traversal example, the trailing ;null is important to prevent the auto-iteration, right? If so, the docs should call this out specifically as a footnote.\n\nadded that\n\n> 1. visualTraversal should appear in the :remote config parameters table.\n\nit is documented but i think there was a formatting problem with asciidoc and it was getting cut out on generation. that should be fixed in my push.\n\n> 1. There doesn't seem to be a good way to see the existing configuration values. :remote config visualTraversal graph displays all config values (except visualTraversal), but maybe it might be better if for example :remote config workspace with no arguments would return the current value.\n> 2. Along the same lines, :remote config help might be nice to let the user know what parameters can be configured.\n\nPlease create JIRA issues for these two if you think they are important. I just wanted to get Gephi working on 0.9 for purposes of this body of work.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/219036360/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/219201548","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/312#issuecomment-219201548","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/312","id":219201548,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxOTIwMTU0OA==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-14T05:19:17Z","updated_at":"2016-05-14T05:19:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"docker/build.sh -t -i -n succeeded.\n\nVOTE: +1\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/219201548/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/219436216","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/308#issuecomment-219436216","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/308","id":219436216,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxOTQzNjIxNg==","user":{"login":"pluradj","id":4974160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NzQxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4974160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj","html_url":"https://github.com/pluradj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-16T14:17:23Z","updated_at":"2016-05-16T14:17:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for the updates.
