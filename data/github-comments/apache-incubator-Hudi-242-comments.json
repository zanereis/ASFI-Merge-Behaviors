Let's take a COW example where the records changed in the latest file slice spread evenly across row groups/pages (red lines on the side) in the previous file slice. To compute the diff, we need to potentially read the entire previous file slice. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"1163\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1179324/172874055-99e4f713-21b6-4278-bed6-1b3741590f25.png\">\r\n\r\nIf we have a CDC log attached to the slice at t1, then we only read the changed rows. So there is a difference IMO in terms of total query I/O i.e bytes read per CDC query. This has been our single biggest source of confusion. We say - we make it flexible around on-the-fly vs materializing and then go back right into claiming either materializing is not needed :) and/or on-the-fly is cheap. Should we actually microbenchmark both approaches and be done? \r\n\r\n>the MOR table has different layout for different index,\r\n\r\nyes that my meta point that our design should not be based on handles, but a more generic CDC log format. In the case, inserts are sent to log (even for Spark/HBase index, they are IIRC), then we would encode `I` in the CDC format correctly.\r\nThis is what I feel \" we need to design this even more generically at the file group/slice level\"

But I am not sure if we can do that. after few commits, if user wishes to add upsert records, we may need the bloom filter index. May be we can take it as another feature support. Make entire table immutable sort of. In that case, we can avoid generating/populating bloom filter as wel.\r\n\r\nYeah, we have to modify the parquet writer to let bloom filter optional. I could create a JIRA for optional bloom filter if necessary. In my local testing, bloom filter generation could take up ~20% costs of the writing part.\r\n\r\nActually in this PR, there will be no record key (i.e., empty string). If user want to upsert records, they need to re-load the full table or use SIMPLE

Looks like for a table w/ very large no of partitions, we are regressing after #4643. Can you take a look to see if we can come up w/ some middle ground may be. 10x is definitely bad.\r\n\r\nHi @nsivabalan Sorry for this blocking :< The performance depends on the bottleneck which is the number of partitions or the number of data files in each partitions. It's hard to balance. Based our PRD cases, we have a lot more files compared to the number of partitions, and this change is helpful. But as you said 10x is too bad. We definitely need to  revert this change before 0.11.1. \r\n\r\nAfter this maybe we can offer a config to let advanced users decide what kind of method he need to use based on their use case? or some way to detect  automatically like we can use MDT to get the partition numbers of current table with small efforts. Then we can automatically choose which algorithm to use based on a certain threshold.\r\n\r\nSorry for this blocking again.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1152332531/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1152401822","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/5522#issuecomment-1152401822","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/5522","id":1152401822,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5EsEGe","user":{"login":"xushiyan","id":2701446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDE0NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2701446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan","html_url":"https://github.com/xushiyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-10T14:08:08Z","updated_at":"2022-06-10T14:08:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"long-running e2e testing with spark 3.2.1 passed","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1152401822/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1152420997","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/5829#issuecomment-1152420997","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/5829","id":1152420997,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5EsIyF","user":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-10T14:27:11Z","updated_at":"2022-06-10T14:27:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Here is what I am thinking.

your files to be disjoint w/ \"values\"

you for the explanation.\r\n\r\nThe column stats indexes / data skipping are awesome addition to 0.11.0 already - given that in docs they are mentioned in same breath as bloom index - I assumed there is a use for bloom based secondary indexes too \r\n- think customer uild column for example - since it is a random string, column stats would be relatively useless - but bloom filter could skip 99% of all files when looking for a particular uuid.\r\nOr am I missing on how the column stats work - reading the code/metadata - they seem useful for monotonic or slowly changing columns - like dates or db FK's - where min/max stats in combination of clustering/sorting can do proper data skipping.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1152845213/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1152869946","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/5727#issuecomment-1152869946","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/5727","id":1152869946,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5Et2Y6","user":{"login":"hudi-bot","id":79415918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDE1OTE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79415918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/hudi-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-11T06:56:51Z","updated_at":"2022-06-11T06:56:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\nMeta
