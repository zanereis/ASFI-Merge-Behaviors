Remember that one thing that we want to be able to do is to pass a (JSONLD) context (as a jena context) to the Writer, in order to have it used when computing the output. But there is a problem with JSONLD java (see [issue 184](https://github.com/jsonld-java/jsonld-java/issues/184)): it doesn't seem possible (or at least, easy) to let the user set the (JSONLD) context to something like `\"@context\": \"http://schema.org/\"`. The best that I can do is to pass the content corresponding to the URL (downloaded and converted to a map) to the JSONLD API, and then to substitute the @context value with \"http://schema.org/\" at the end of the process (just before writing the output).\n\n(I hadn't seen this problem when I created the pull request, because at this time, there was no way to have JSON-LD java download externally defined contexts, because of incompatible versions of HttpClient used by jena and json-ld java).\n\nRegarding the way to expose the Symbols that can be set it the (jena) context, and the classes expected for the corresponding values, are you OK with a JSONLDWriteContext class (extending Context), with methods such as:\n\n```\n        public void setOptions(JsonLdOptions opts) {     \n            set(JSONLD_OPTIONS_SYMBOL, opts);\n        }\n```\n\nI try to finalize something quickly and I update this.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/248277144/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/249381791","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/139#issuecomment-249381791","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/139","id":249381791,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0OTM4MTc5MQ==","user":{"login":"fpservant","id":5287470,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODc0NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5287470?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpservant","html_url":"https://github.com/fpservant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpservant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpservant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpservant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpservant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpservant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpservant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpservant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpservant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpservant/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-24T19:04:57Z","updated_at":"2016-09-24T19:04:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I updated this with some sample code, and it seems to me that this is as good as _I_ can.

Am I correct?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/251080140/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/251081256","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/151#issuecomment-251081256","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/151","id":251081256,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MTA4MTI1Ng==","user":{"login":"ajs6f","id":110994,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDk5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/110994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f","html_url":"https://github.com/ajs6f","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-03T11:10:26Z","updated_at":"2016-10-03T11:10:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@rvesse That is _exactly_ what has slowed this down! :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/251081256/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/251083413","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/139#issuecomment-251083413","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/139","id":251083413,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MTA4MzQxMw==","user":{"login":"ajs6f","id":110994,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDk5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/110994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f","html_url":"https://github.com/ajs6f","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-03T11:24:40Z","updated_at":"2016-10-03T11:24:40Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@fpservant, No, using that button, you can send a patch for the page now, but it will not be applied until the trigger is pulled to republish the docs pages.

I can fix the problem @afs  found.\n2. I don't want to, because I realize now that I did this whole PR wrong.\n\nIf you read up this page, you'll see where both @afs and I remark that it's odd that `HttpClient`s can't be built from extant `HttpClient`s. It took me until now to understand why. You can call `build()` on an `HttpClientBuilder` as many times as you want for as many clients as you want with the exact same config. I should never have rethreaded the call hierarchies with `HttpClient`. It should have been `HttpClientBuilder` all the time, all the way down to `HttpOp` which, within `exec()`, should build and close a client, leaving the builder for infinite reuse.\n\n{sigh}\n\nSo in order to do this right, I need to redo a good piece of it. That will get rid of a lot of subtle things I had to add in the test code to make this work in its current form (should have realized something was wrong). This is now my top priority because this saga has gone on too long already (yay all-volunteer projects :) ).

AFS_TS_Debug : set the used HttpClient to null.\n\nSome changes for Fuseki1 test cleanup pushed to Jena master.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/253234559/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/253370636","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/151#issuecomment-253370636","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/151","id":253370636,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MzM3MDYzNg==","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-12T23:41:06Z","updated_at":"2016-10-12T23:41:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"New branch : [http_op_2](https://github.com/afs/jena/tree/http_op_2)\n\nGreen line!\n\nThis is PR#151, the clean-ups in Jena master and some server control for jena-jdbc-driver-remote.\n\nIn particular, the pooling `HttpClient` is reset when the server is stop/started.\n\nNotes:\n1.

They are probably just cruft from the early days of development.\n\nHistorically AspectJ was used in order to inject trace level logging into every single method in the JDBC code base. The logic behind this was that the intent was for the driver to be used with generic JDBC tools where attaching a debugger would have been difficult/impossible and so you would've had to rely on logging to do debugging. This probably doesn't apply any more so you may as well remove it. There may be associated entries in the license/notice that should also be removed.
