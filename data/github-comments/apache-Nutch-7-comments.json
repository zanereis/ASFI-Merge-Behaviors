Please, always check the return value of job.waitForCompletion(...) and if it returns false:\r\n- perform the necessary cleanups: delete temporary data, etc.\r\n- make the main routine return 1\r\n\r\nI can only second Lewis: please, try to run tests independently in local and pseudo-distributed mode. One iteration (commit/PR, test, analyze and report error) takes too long otherwise.

We have tight integration between Nutch and Tika dev community. Once the code is removed over in Tika, it is trivial to remove the code over here.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day it is down to the contributor if this code is to be updated or not, I just think preservation is an important part of what we do here. Retaining the legacy plugin is doing no harm whatsoever.\r\nThanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/comments/339066193/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/comments/339069109","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nutch/pull/232#issuecomment-339069109","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/232","id":339069109,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzOTA2OTEwOQ==","user":{"login":"lewismc","id":1165719,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjU3MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1165719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc","html_url":"https://github.com/lewismc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-24T17:29:31Z","updated_at":"2017-10-24T17:29:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"+1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/comments/339069109/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/comments/339083180","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nutch/pull/233#issuecomment-339083180","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/233","id":339083180,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzOTA4MzE4MA==","user":{"login":"YossiTamari","id":33034182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDM0MTgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33034182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YossiTamari","html_url":"https://github.com/YossiTamari","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YossiTamari/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YossiTamari/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YossiTamari/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YossiTamari/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YossiTamari/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YossiTamari/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YossiTamari/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YossiTamari/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YossiTamari/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-24T18:16:41Z","updated_at":"2017-10-24T18:16:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sorry for the mix-up, pipldev is my alternate account...\r\n\r\nSpeaking as a relatively new user of Nutch, I have never looked for a readme file in a plugin directory.

I've continued testing, and was able to feed two Solr indexes in parallel. Great! Afaics, all requested changes have been made (also that of @lewismc).\r\n\r\nTo make the configuration work out of the box, I would suggest 3 changes:\r\n- use only field names defined in the default schema.xml\r\n`ERROR: [doc=http://nutch.apache.org/] unknown field 'search'\r\n- default Solr core name should be \"nutch\" as described in the [tutorial](https://wiki.apache.org/nutch/NutchTutorial)\r\n\r\nI've tried to fix these issues in \"[a fork of NUTCH-1480](https://github.com/sebastian-nagel/nutch/commits/NUTCH-1480)\". Feel free to cherry pick it from there.\r\n\r\nI've also tried to make indexer-dummy work. Without success, the file is created but then overwritten:\r\n\r\n- there are two instances of `IndexWriters` active, each having a separate instance of DummyIndexWriter.\r\n   - the instance created from `IndexerOutputFormat.getRecordWriter(IndexerOutputFormat.java:39)` writes into the file\r\n   - but later on the instance created from `IndexWriters.open(IndexWriters.java:187)` opens the file anew, at the end there is an empty file. Because it's two instances there is no possibility to check whether the file writer is already instantiated.\r\n\r\nI see two potential solutions:\r\n1. the IndexWriter interface method `open(job, name)` was defined with file indexers in mind (cf. NUTCH-1541/[CSVIndexWriter](https://github.com/sebastian-nagel/nutch/blob/NUTCH-1541/src/plugin/indexer-csv/src/java/org/apache/nutch/indexwriter/csv/CSVIndexWriter.java#L233)), an index writer can then decide to do nothing when called with name \"commit\".\r\n2. do not call the `commit()` method explicitly (ev. also remove it from the interface: it does not safely work in distributed mode because it's not run in the reducers (see the comment in RabbitIndexWriter).\r\n\r\nI tend to the second solution. It would also solve the problem of having two IndexWriters instances active.

I agree with your suggestions and I included the changes you propose from your fork.\r\n\r\nAbout indexer-dummy, I also tried to make it work, but it was not possible. In theory, you can build as many instances of `IndexWriters` as you want, that you will always get the same instance, because it gotten from cache. So, the first issue I found was the `ObjectCache` uses the `Configuration` object itself as the key, and this object is not the same in each call. This causes that there are two instances of `IndexWriters` writing to same file, as you say. So, I replaced the key of `ObjectCache` with the UUID of the `Configuration` object.\r\n\r\nNow, we have only one instance of `IndexWriters`, but there is another problem: when you try to commit the writers in `IndexingJob.index(IndexingJob.java151)` it is already closed from `IndexerOutputFormat.getRecordWriter(IndexerOutputFormat.java:44)`. Therefore, I moved the `commit()` call from `IndexingJob` to `IndexerOutputFormat`, just before the `close()` method is called.\r\n\r\nI also, moved the indexers description from `IndexingJob` to `IndexerOutputFormat`, to avoid to build `IndexWriters` instance twice.\r\n\r\nThanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/comments/346834693/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/comments/347460711","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nutch/pull/246#issuecomment-347460711","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/246","id":347460711,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NzQ2MDcxMQ==","user":{"login":"sebastian-nagel","id":1630582,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzA1ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1630582?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastian-nagel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-28T09:16:40Z","updated_at":"2017-11-28T09:16:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Does #247 replace this pull request?
