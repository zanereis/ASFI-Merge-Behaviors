Can we break out once all docs are loaded?\r\n\r\nIf I wait for a longer duration for all the docs to be loaded (as we do in other integration tests), there is a good chance that most of realtime segments might have already been committed by that time. So the queries will go to the completed offline segments.\r\n\r\nMy goal with this test is to serve majority of the queries via realtime segments with text index and see an increasing number of hits as queries are run consecutively, documents are being ingested and realtime segments are refreshed in the background.\r\n\r\nSince I don't know how many times this particular search string is present in the data (which is generated randomly), I can't really break out.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/587271614/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/587276106","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/5077#issuecomment-587276106","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/5077","id":587276106,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NzI3NjEwNg==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-18T04:45:36Z","updated_at":"2020-02-18T04:55:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#

Note that each dimension recipient is independent of each other (each dimension recipient receives a completely different email), and there is no point in notifying other dimension recipients about the error. We could probably send an error email to the specific concerned recipients which would be helpful even in other normal cases. For example, if the detection failed or our default subscription config has an issue then we can send an error email. We can discuss this further offline.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, what I have been thinking for a while is that we introduce the concept of subscription health similar to detection health and use that to kind of track how it performs (maybe even make it part of the email).\r\n\r\nBesides, this specific PR attempts to address this issue by logging and emitting metrics which can be tracked and hopefully we can introduce some more sophisticated offline validations on the config so that such things do not occur, at least not by misconfiguration.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/591012020/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/591159606","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/5046#issuecomment-591159606","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/5046","id":591159606,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MTE1OTYwNg==","user":{"login":"jackjlli","id":35080149,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MDgwMTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35080149?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli","html_url":"https://github.com/jackjlli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-26T00:19:19Z","updated_at":"2020-02-26T00:19:19Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This

Besides, this specific PR attempts to address this issue by logging and emitting metrics which can be tracked and hopefully we can introduce some more sophisticated offline validations on the config so that such things do not occur, at least not by misconfiguration.\r\n\r\nLike the idea of monitoring using autometrics.\r\nIt is a little different with detection health monitoring. For detection pipeline if we find the MAPE degrades we can retrain the model. There is nothing we can do except fixing the configurations for notification. We should aiming at 100% success for notifications.
