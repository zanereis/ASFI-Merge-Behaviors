The latest commit fixes that. \r\n\r\nI was able to verify the 2 cases @cestella mentioned.  For the first test I update the bro sensor config:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"hdfs\": {\r\n    \"index\": \"bro\",\r\n    \"batchSize\": 5,\r\n    \"enabled\": true\r\n  },\r\n  \"elasticsearch\": {\r\n    \"index\": \"bro\",\r\n    \"batchSize\": 5,\r\n    \"enabled\": true\r\n  },\r\n  \"solr\": {\r\n    \"index\": \"bro_2\",\r\n    \"batchSize\": 5,\r\n    \"enabled\": true\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nA search result now looks like:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"id\": \"44fc8391-474d-4b8e-a375-52f748735b2f\",\r\n  \"source\": {\r\n    ...\r\n    \"source.type\": \"bro\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"score\": 0,\r\n  \"index\": \"bro_2\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nFor the next test I deleted the snort indexing config.  A search result against that collection now looks like:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"id\": \"71a0ca1a-b3c2-414b-9fde-c31e8dd5544a\",\r\n  \"source\": {\r\n    ...\r\n    \"source.type\": \"snort\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"score\": 0,\r\n  \"index\": \"snort\"\r\n}\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/391875240/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/391903482","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1031#issuecomment-391903482","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1031","id":391903482,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MTkwMzQ4Mg==","user":{"login":"cestella","id":540359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella","html_url":"https://github.com/cestella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-25T00:11:48Z","updated_at":"2018-05-25T00:11:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@merrimanr I submitted a [PR](https://github.com/merrimanr/incubator-metron/pull/36) against your PR, which I think will clean up the rest of the loose ends around missing indexes and catches a small bug in the indexing supplier.

I think there are some useful, clarifying refactorings in this PR. I'm generally in favor of refactoring improvements e.g. \"handleTick(tuple)\" that sum up the code nicely. I also like adding sensible clarifying comments and making tests more clear. However, I'm not sure how I feel about mixing refactoring like this with the bug fix itself. It seems to me that the actual bug fix is roughly 5-10 lines of code. It makes it more difficult to determine code that's specific to the change in mind. I noticed this while reviewing https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1015 as well. Might it be better to do separate refactoring PR's? I am certainly not suggesting we be pedantic about it - I'm not even clear how I would even suggest a reasonable rule to follow, to be honest. Part of me thinks \"ok, broken window theory and boyscout rules - this is great stuff.\" But in general, I think that splitting the refactoring will allow reviewers to voice opinions specific to coding style and refactoring changes as distinct from a feature or bug fix itself. It's clear that we all have varying opinions on what reads best in our code, and I think splitting those discussions off will make the review process more expedient.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/392971537/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/392974513","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1036#issuecomment-392974513","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1036","id":392974513,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5Mjk3NDUxMw==","user":{"login":"cestella","id":540359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella","html_url":"https://github.com/cestella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-29T22:59:45Z","updated_at":"2018-05-29T22:59:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Yeah, I have mixed reactions.
