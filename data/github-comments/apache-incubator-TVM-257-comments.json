I started  with this one but then decided to go with the approach because most exceptions are indeed KeyboardInterrupt. After the discussion I agree it can be more important to preserve the exception type.\r\n\r\nThis implementation does that. The approach is similar to pybind's approach of handling the exception. When error happens a special exception is thrown, and the error is not cleared but propagated into the FFI layer through a specific return code.\r\n\r\nThe only limitation here is that the stacktrace will only start from the FFI(the C++ traces are not tracked), but it is fine as the signal handling itself is also already async.\r\n\r\nI have also considered your proposal of having a SignalChecking function in the FFI layer and started with that impl before sending the PR. My conclusion so far there are only limited set that it is  cleaner to bring the API directly in the runtime. As the implementation hides behind a common API (registerCAPI) that won't change, we can consider refactor later. But given the processing code is usually short, it does not hurt to put them close to the implementation site either.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/830676898/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/830697859","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7948#issuecomment-830697859","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7948","id":830697859,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzMDY5Nzg1OQ==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-01T21:35:05Z","updated_at":"2021-05-01T21:35:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"THanks

I think all the code currently in apps/stm32 should live outside the TVM tree. \r\n\r\nThis is acceptable - I can remove it from the TVM.\r\n\r\n> 2. I think we should move the code in src/runtime/stm32 plus the code in tests/micro/stm32/src/ into apps/micro/stm32. Organizationally, I'd prefer to keep src/runtime dedicated to the TVM runtime logic. Since, as discussed on the RFC, the medium-term direction will be to move the TVM runtime in the direction of the one you proposed, I would rather consider this an \"app\" than an official implementation. As we move the TVM runtime forward, presumably this will eventually resemble a small shim or would disappear if the TVM runtime APIs are moved to match these (I would sort of expect there to be some minor differences in the long run between TVM and the cross-toolchain STM X-Cube AI APIs).\r\n\r\nIf we do this, it will complicate our own code maintenance and we may overtime diverge from TVM. This is why:\r\n1. The src/runtime and src/runtime/contrib already contain a number of target-specific runtime implementations, while the apps contains really the application/integration examples.\r\n2. As I have mentioned in the RFC, we insist on separating the Application code from the Tools. The idea for us is to have our code generator + runtime part of the TVM distributed with the TVM. We want to avoid to refer to tvm/apps for accessing the runtime layer. If this were to be checked into the apps directory, we will certainly have to structure it differently with our tools offering, which will lead to needing to maintain two repositories - not what we need. **For us it is an official TVM for STM32 implementation rather than an app**.\r\n3.  I sort of disagree that the slim layer is bound to completely disappear. On the contrary,  there will most certainly be a need to such a slim adaptation layer between the micro TVM API and any particular target system, for example for the memory allocation part. Isn't it better that these slim layers live in the src/runtime rather then in apps ?\r\n\r\nPerhaps we can figure out some middle ground here:\r\n\r\n- We could move the src/runtime/stm32 to the src/runtime/contrib/stm32, or\r\n- We could rename it into src/runtime/(contrib)/x-cube to resemble more coreml, rocm, cuda, etc.\r\n- We do not have any particular position on the tests/ directory - I will integrate our test anyway you deem appropriate, can go to the apps/stm32. However, I did not understand: are you proposing to separate the src part of the test from the rest ?\r\n\r\n> I'd suggest we don't output device-specific things (e.g. linker scripts) in `python/tvm/contrib/stm32/emitter.py.`\r\n\r\nI will remove this.\r\n\r\nThe following is already taken care of:\r\n\r\n> everything in the TVM tree needs to get apache-licensed, so by checking in that code we need to be sure that's cool with you guys\r\n\r\nThe TVM license header is already added to all code.\r\n\r\n> anything in the TVM tree will need a defined path to be tested (ideally one that's automated) and any maintenance will need to go through our code review process\r\n\r\nThis is understood. This is why we want our runtime layer to be integrated as a \"real\" runtime with the TVM - it will be the only place it lives in and is maintained: it is TVM specific..\r\n\r\nWhat do you think ?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/830804983/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/830808263","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7819#issuecomment-830808263","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7819","id":830808263,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzMDgwODI2Mw==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-02T13:16:29Z","updated_at":"2021-05-02T13:16:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"We

@apeskov . This is an important step. Would be great if we can think about de-couple further to reverse the dependency. (e.g. make the macho depend on libtvm as a plugin).\r\n\r\nThe main rationale is that depending on the license we may not want to directly make this as a submodule(which means we will package and distribute the source by default and there might be some license complications).\r\n\r\nHere is an idea:\r\n- We create another plugin module that depends on libtvm which registers an overrided version of so loader.\r\n- see https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/main/src/runtime/dso_library.cc#L93\r\n- We can then run a plugin that registers the new loader back to TVM. see an example here https://github.com/apache/tvm/tree/main/apps/extension\r\n\r\nThis way we do not need to hijack the dso library \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/832848378/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/832849433","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7975#issuecomment-832849433","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7975","id":832849433,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzMjg0OTQzMw==","user":{"login":"tkonolige","id":1501680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDE2ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1501680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkonolige","html_url":"https://github.com/tkonolige","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkonolige/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkonolige/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkonolige/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkonolige/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkonolige/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkonolige/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkonolige/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkonolige/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkonolige/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-05T16:50:02Z","updated_at":"2021-05-05T16:50:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think we should keep the error message, but maybe we can improve it.

We could of course add a paragraph of how to enable this message in the tutorial.\r\n\r\n(B) by @tkonolige: Improve the message to make it more informative. This is also a valuable direction so I try to make it more concrete. First, we remove the last scary sentence from the message:\r\n```\r\nWARNING autotvm:compile_engine.py:256 Missing config for target=llvm -keys=cpu -link-params=0, workload=('conv2d_NCHWc.x86', ('TENSOR', (1, 1, 32, 32), 'float32'), ('TENSOR', (8, 1, 5, 5), 'float32'), (1, 1), (0, 0, 0, 0), (1, 1), 'NCHW', 'NCHW', 'float32').\r\n```\r\nSecond, when we are about to display this warning for the first time, we also display the message as Tristan mentioned:\r\n```\r\nOne or more config are missing. Please tune your model for better performance (link).\r\n```\r\n\r\n(C) by myself: Combine both options. That is, we only show the overall warning once and put the detail schedule missing warnings to DEBUG.\r\n```\r\nOne or more config are missing.
