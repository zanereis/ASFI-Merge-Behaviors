think this is the last update I have on this issue.\n\n`QueryRequest.limit` always is higher than results from Cassandra queries, regardless of the schema adjustment we made (though the schema change does actually help with precision). That's because limit is applied to redundant index entries, which are deduped client side. The redundant index count is related to span count per trace.\n\nIt is a fools errand to attempt to deduplicate trace ids on the (cassandra) server side because trace ids aren't a partition key. We can only do distinct clauses on partition keys. The only way left is to compensate on the (cassandra) client side: zipkin in this case.\n\nHere's two concrete proposals:\n\n### Change CassandraSpanConsumer to cache trace id indexes locally\n\nBy caching trace id indexes locally, we can ensure that at least in the same collector shard, we don't write the same unique input more than once per trace. This will be most effective for those who run a single collector or consistently route trace ids to collector instances. Even randomly routed collectors should see smaller indexes, when spans in the same trace are bundled when reported from tracers.\n\n### Change CassandraSpanStore to fetch more trace ids than `QueryRequest.limit`\n\nThe trace id query returns very little data: trace id and timestamp. One option is to just prefetch more than limit and dedupe client side. Since this issue is amplified at low trace counts, we can simply make a floor of 100 and dedupe to `QueryRequest.limit`. This could be a first step before we do something like multiple expanding queries.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/229370609/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/229583428","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/1156#issuecomment-229583428","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1156","id":229583428,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyOTU4MzQyOA==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-30T07:39:59Z","updated_at":"2016-06-30T07:39:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"One neat side-effect is that it also logs the DDL stuff, which can explain large pauses on startup.\n\nEx.\n\n```\n2016-06-30 15:39:14.267 TRACE 29485 --- [r2-nio-worker-1] c.d.driver.core.QueryLogger.NORMAL       : [cluster2] [localhost/127.0.0.1:9042] Query completed normally, took 50 ms: [0 bound values] CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS zipkin.traces (\n    trace_id  bigint,\n    ts        timestamp,\n    span_name text,\n    span      blob,\n    PRIMARY KEY (trace_id, ts, span_name)\n)\n    WITH compaction = {'class': 'org.apache.cassandra.db.compaction.DateTieredCompactionStrategy', 'max_window_size_seconds': '86400'}\n    AND default_time_to_live =  604800;\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/229583428/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/230076776","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1158#issuecomment-230076776","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1158","id":230076776,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMDA3Njc3Ng==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-02T01:36:54Z","updated_at":"2016-07-02T01:36:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This is a bit large a topic to address in this repo, and wouldn't likely affect any code inside of it.

For example, how to accept trace identifiers.. how to report json (or otherwise) back to zipkin. Dividing concerns can help make helping more approachable, as people often don't have time to address several topics at the same time.\n\nWhat would also make things more approachable is not doing this in Oracle. For example, see if you can create a scenario similar enough in something like mysql or postgresql. Then, port your approach to Oracle.\n\nBack to specifics, I don't think there's any existing SQL database accepting traces propagated from a zipkin-instrumented caller. There is one for cassandra https://github.com/thelastpickle/cassandra-zipkin-tracing\n\nThere may be some topics on our documentation site that need added to or elaborated.

(ex if it is\nsingle-host spans, we can simply make things like this tags)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/230691632/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/230694145","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/306#issuecomment-230694145","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/306","id":230694145,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMDY5NDE0NQ==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-06T07:01:38Z","updated_at":"2016-07-06T07:01:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"ps here's a link about model problems, and behind my desire for this issue to result in a tactical change vs an incompatible one.

I'm ok with either, actually, and happy to have folks vote for whatever they prefer and implement accordingly.\n\n### Add Endpoint.address[String]\n\nThis would hold an opaque value and deprecates ipv4. We could say that this overrides any value held in ipv4, and perhaps backfill it at query time (as we do with Span.timestamp).\n\n#### Thrift\n\nWe'd mark ipv4 deprecated and add the following:\n\n``` thrift\nstruct Endpoint {\n--snip--\n /**\n  * Holds the text representation of a IPv4 or IPv6 address associated with this endpoint\n  * \n  * IPv4 address: Ex. \"1.2.3.4\" per RFC 2673, section 3.2.\n  * IPv6 address: Ex. \"2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334\" per RFC 2373, section 2.2.\n  */\n  4: optional string address\n```\n\n#### Json\n\nI'm not aware of a json-schema type that describes both ipv4 and ipv6.\n\n### Add Endpoint.ipv6[bytes]\n\nThis would be optional and hold the 128 bits for the ipv6 address and doesn't affect ipv4.\n\n#### Thrift\n\nWe'd the following:\n\n``` thrift\nstruct Endpoint {\n--snip--\n /**\n  * IPv6 host address packed into 16 bytes. Ex Inet6Address.getBytes()\n  */\n  4: optional binary ipv6\n```\n\n#### Json\n\nUses text format, just like the \"ipv4\" currently does. Document \"ipv6\" as the the json schema type of the same name.\n\n### Pros and Cons\n\naddress[String] will require a larger thrift field and row, although in both cases it is bounded by largest text form of an IP (50bytes). Some may object to the rows \\* 50 bytes enlarging of annotation/binary annotation namespace, and can choose not to store this.\n\nipv6[bytes] is separate from ipv4, which means an endpoint could have both an ipv6 and ipv4 association. It is more consistent in approach, but the current approach of ipv4 in thrift has proven annoying to some. This choice still needs a column even if it only needs to be 16bytes long.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/230697431/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/230697810","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/306#issuecomment-230697810","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/306","id":230697810,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMDY5NzgxMA==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-06T07:24:27Z","updated_at":"2016-07-06T07:24:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@mosesn

second @adriancole, changing backend store like cassandra/mysql shouldn't affect the # of returned spans.

If you see latency constraints, try the KAFKA_STREAMS option with the value same as # of partitions (collector now tries to read from all partitions parallely). As the number of partitions can't be reduced and it is just a one way road, increase should only be done if latency becomes an issue.
