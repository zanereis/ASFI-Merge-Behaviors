for Python3 only, although some Airflow users still run on Python2.7 so unfortunately I'm pretty certain it has to last until end of life...\r\n\r\nSome other suggestions (all take quite some work):\r\n- Split Airflow into core & extras (all operators, hooks, etc.) so we can test separate\r\n- Remove Python2\r\n- Create pre-built test environments (unsure how Docker and Travis work together?) to avoid installing all CI dependencies every single run\r\n- Make sensible decision about which tests should be ran against multiple database types and which are okay to be tested only once\r\n\r\nI hope some day there's time for all this

as you say, each will take a long time. And the long cycle will make them longer as well. It’s a chicken and egg problem. :-)\r\n\r\nI struggle with getting work done on airflow due to the difficulty in setting up a dev environment. I still only half have a docker env like the one in the test env’s, so I end up relying on the test cases running in travis. Furthermore reading the logs to find which tests failed takes a non trivial amount of time, and then trying to figure out what more elements of the env setup I need to run a particular test take more time. \r\n\r\nThe main drive of the work that I’m doing is towards your first suggestion. I’m working on the plugin architecture to split the airflow code into modular sections to let us split it out. In the meantime, it would be nice not to have to wait 2 hours if my tests passed. :-)\r\n\r\n<sub>Sent with <a href=\"http://githawk.com\">GitHawk</a></sub>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/463538571/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/463542539","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3858#issuecomment-463542539","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3858","id":463542539,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MzU0MjUzOQ==","user":{"login":"OmerJog","id":44576851,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NTc2ODUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44576851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmerJog","html_url":"https://github.com/OmerJog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmerJog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmerJog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmerJog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmerJog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmerJog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmerJog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmerJog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmerJog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmerJog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-14T08:45:28Z","updated_at":"2019-02-14T08:45:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Fokko Is this functionality needed and it's blocked by https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3579  or this PR is not needed at all?

I have seen the same thing. This happens when you generated a dagrun on master and try to view this on this branch. This is because some values are missing from the database because master is not aware of them.\r\nIf you reset your database and create a start a dagrun on this branch the issue is not there anymore. \r\n\r\nThe main issue is the color column in task_instance. There could be 3 possible solutions:\r\n- Keep it as it is and accept a breaking change because this is for airflow 2.0 anyway.\r\n- Add a default color on the database migrations\r\n- Reparse dag files to fetch the color during the database migrations","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/463929201/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
