However, it is done differently than this and not using this flag since the logic is only needed when creating the parser/unparsers. It isn't needed at runtime like this flag is.\r\n\r\nRelated, one side effect of how the content/valueLength stuff works now is you can only get the content/valueLength of something used in an expression, since the parsers/unparsers are laid down to capture that information only when it might be needed. So things like debuggers cannot use this information on arbitrary elements.\r\n\r\nSo it might be worth it to remove the capture processors completely and use this new flag (or something similar, I don't think it can be exactly the same) at runtime in the appropriate processors to determine when to capture length. And when debugging, we would just always capture the length of everything. This would mean there might be some added overhead to constantly check this flag (which will most often be false) to see if we need to capture length, but one boolean check shouldn't be too bad.\r\n\r\nThat said, this seems like an enhancement that I'm not sure is a high priority right now. We already have the optimization to remove unneeded capture length parsers, which I think is the important part of this

the scallop library, the issue is likely that the daffodil-cli subproject is not aggregated into the root project. So any command you run on the root (e.g. sbt compile, sbt test, sbt updateClassifiers) will also run on all subprojects ***except*** the daffodil-cli subproject. To run a command on the daffodil-cli subproject you must explicitly specify it. This prevents running all the CLI tests (which take a long time) when you run ``sbt test``. So in addition to running ``sbt updateClassifiers`` you also need to run ``sbt daffodil-cli/updateClassifiers``. This should be added to our eclipse set up documentation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/355086254/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/355294765","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/22#issuecomment-355294765","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/22","id":355294765,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NTI5NDc2NQ==","user":{"login":"mbeckerle","id":1524099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1524099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle","html_url":"https://github.com/mbeckerle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-04T14:25:12Z","updated_at":"2018-01-04T14:25:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ooops.

First off, I don't think you can specify xs:minLength on an xs:int or xs:decimal.
