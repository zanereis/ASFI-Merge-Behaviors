Since:\r\n\r\n1. We still cannot programmatically prevent users from calling `store.close()`.\r\n2. User implementing the `Processor` API would probably not know anything about \"rebalancing\" and \"processor re-usage\" at all.\r\n\r\nInstead, I'd suggest we change the javadoc to sth. like \"users only need to implement this function but NEVER need to call this api explicitly since they will be triggered by the library automatically when necessary\". AND update the examples to remove the close calls. This is true since in `ProcessorStateManager` we will close the stores after the whole topology (i.e. all nodes) has been closed, which is actually the right ordering.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/288498294/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/288498451","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2725#issuecomment-288498451","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2725","id":288498451,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4ODQ5ODQ1MQ==","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-22T18:38:47Z","updated_at":"2017-03-22T18:38:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"BTW

we would need to change our hierarchy somewhat, i.e., `KeyValueStore` and `WindowStore` won't be able to extend `StateStore`, the implementations of these interfaces would need to implement

Also, there is nothing to stop anyone from casting to the Impl if they really want.\r\n\r\nThat said, i still think we should do something to restrict this. Just not as part of this PR.
