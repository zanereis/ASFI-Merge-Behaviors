If in a k8s env and we have 1 ti per pod, will this include the logs from the main process into the ti log?\r\n\r\n@KevinYang21 Thanks for the very detailed review! loved reading through your comments, and looking into addressing all of them. each TI that runs on a worker process is tagged with a `log_id` field, but the logs from the main process are not. When a log entry is read from elasticsearch, it expects that `log_id` to be part of the http request. So the logs from the main process won't be a part of the subsequent response, since the `log_id` will be empty/null. In the EFK stack, we tag every TI log with a log_id in the fluentD pipeline before sending it off to elasticsearch, but a user can do it any way they'd like (Logstash, Beats) as long as that `log_id` field is present.

On holiday now so responding a bit slowely.\r\n\r\nRegarding the lines in `tests/core.py` you pointed out, it was a conscious decision to leave them since some of them are relating to the `contrib/auth` modules. As discussed in \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4612, it's preferable to split the works into multiple PRs, and these tests are always skipped currently anyway. But after double-thinking, I think it may make more sense to delete these tests here in this PR, to avoid confusion. I have already updated the commits.\r\n\r\nRegarding `airflow/config_templates/default_test.cfg`, I had a check and no change is needed to me (the a few config items we delete in this PR don't appear in `airflow/config_templates/default_test.cfg`). Please let me know if I missed anything.\r\n\r\nThanks!

You don't have resources at expected URI's to interact with. Instead you use parameters to define exactly which flask models you wish to query against, as opposed to which airflow resources. \r\n\r\nAs an example this is the difference between\r\n\r\n```\r\nGET /experimental/api/dags/my_custom_dag HTTP/1.1\r\n\r\nGET /experimental/api/dags/read?_flt_0_field_string_dag_name=my_custom_dag HTTP/1.1\r\n```\r\n\r\nor for a delete operation\r\n\r\n```\r\nDELETE /experimental/api/dags/my_custom_dag HTTP/1.1\r\n\r\nDELETE /experimenta/api/dags/delete?_flt_0_field_string_dag_name=my_custom_dag HTTP/1.1\r\n```\r\n\r\n_note_: there's also the duplication of the action in the URL and the HTTP Method which, after reading the docs and tests, I think is required.\r\n\r\nIf I understand the flask-appbuilder REST functionality, it requires the use of the SQLAInterface object to build an abstracted version databases tables. I think it's a good idea to build these in general (not neccesariy for this feature).\r\n\r\nI think what you get for free from the flask-appbuilder after building the models this is better served by using a common industry convention (OpenAPI3), rather than the flask implementation, which in my opinon is quite tightly coupled to flask itself (eg, filters like `_flt_...`).\r\n\r\nUsing OpenAPI3 means we leave external parties to generate clients to interact with airflow in any language which the [autogenerator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) supports. This opens up airflow to being intereacted with by other tools without having to undertake the tedious task of writing each API call into the client automatically. \r\n\r\n_note_: Although we could maintain a swagger definition file in parallel, I think it would eventually fall by the way side and drift from the actual implementation.

Unfortunately, this is not a simple and easy matter\r\n\r\nShort story:\r\nI have been watching this topic for a long time and difficulties have appeared that made this change difficult.\r\nSee: https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/b216d209abff1644fe2cd9e2c144b921b7a84ceead1c8ef6c35103cd@%3Cdev.airflow.apache.org%3E\r\n\r\nLong story: \r\nI've been thinking about Airflow's modularity for a long time.  When I started working on Airflow, support for plugins was limited. It was not possible to install the plugin via \"pip\", so the installation was complicated. In my opinion, this excluded the use of plug-in mechanism in public production solutions.\r\n\r\nI found an [old PR](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/730), which introduced support for plugins installed via pip. I fell in love with this PR, so i tried to revive the old PR. For this purpose, i wrote message to @kaxil  on Slack for support. He wrote [a comment](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/730#issuecomment-443648731) on December 3 in the reaction.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, an alternative PRs has appeared. https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4412. It was accepted quickly\r\n\r\nThe discussion about modularity on the dev list has started. During these discussion, it turned out that splitting Airflow into plugins is not such a simple matter.\r\nhttps://lists.apache.org/thread.html/b216d209abff1644fe2cd9e2c144b921b7a84ceead1c8ef6c35103cd@%3Cdev.airflow.apache.org%3E\r\n@potiuk (I and @sprzedwojski  work in one company) participated in this discussion. We was waiting for community reactions, what will happen next in the matter of accepting AIP-8\r\n\r\nIf you think that it is worth to start changes on this matter, I invite you to the discussion on the mailing list.\r\n\r\nI have the hope that my explanations will be helpful to you.\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your suggestion.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: This is just my personal statement. I described my observations that are public. Other people in my company may think differently. I believe that the presented story allows us to better understand the context.

But I don't agree if the Airflow committers should be the only maintainers to maintain those packages. I know it is a not very simple solution(which one to move out, which one to stay, who should maintain, how to handle dependency etc). \r\n\r\nIMO, It is hard from a user standpoint to decide which one to use, which one is actively maintained and whether it is released in a given Airflow version. In fact, we(Lyft) just rely on the plugin system internally to build various operator/hook which makes our development iteration much faster.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/461967110/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/461988552","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4674#issuecomment-461988552","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4674","id":461988552,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MTk4ODU1Mg==","user":{"login":"feng-tao","id":3223098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjMwOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3223098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao","html_url":"https://github.com/feng-tao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-09T00:06:04Z","updated_at":"2019-02-09T00:06:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"there are getint, getfloat etc in the configuration as well.
