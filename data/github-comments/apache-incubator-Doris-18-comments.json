One thread consumes the queue's items, one by one.  When it wants to send a batch of the NodeChannel which has a in flight packet(rpc hasn’t returned response), it must wait(rpc join).\r\nFor example:\r\nThe batch which index id=0 && node id=2, is denoted by \"B1(0-2)\".\r\nThe Abstract queue as shown below. \r\n\r\nB0(0-1) | B1(0-2) | B2(0-1) | B3(1-4) | ... | ...\r\n-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --\r\n\r\nWhen we are sending B2(0-1), we must wait for the B0 response. But if we set aside B2(0-1) and send the next item \"B3(1-4)\", it won't be blocked.\r\n\r\nSo I used to split the one queue into multi queues(abandoned), as follows.( For details, see https://github.com/apache/incubator-doris/issues/2780#issuecomment-588156273)\r\nBatches queue0:\r\n\r\nB0(0-0) | B1(0-0) | B2(2-0) | B3(4-0) | ... | ...\r\n-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --\r\n\r\n\r\nBatches queue1:\r\n\r\nB0(2-1) | B1(0-1) | B2(0-1) | B3(1-1) | ... | ...\r\n-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --\r\n\r\n\r\nBatches queue2:\r\n\r\nB0(0-2) | B1(0-2) | B2(3-2) | B3(1-2) | ... | ...\r\n-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --\r\n\r\n\r\nEach queue needs one thread to consume items. Block time is shared by multiple queues. But it's still a block way.\r\n\r\n### The new design is non-blocking. \r\nWe can save batches in NodeChannels(pending batches), and **try to send** a pending batch. If the current channel has a in flight packet, we just skip sending in this round.\r\n\r\nThe implementation is coming soon.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/596974767/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/597061705","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/issues/3071#issuecomment-597061705","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/3071","id":597061705,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NzA2MTcwNQ==","user":{"login":"imay","id":1249159,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDkxNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1249159?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay","html_url":"https://github.com/imay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-10T12:33:46Z","updated_at":"2020-03-10T12:33:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"what
