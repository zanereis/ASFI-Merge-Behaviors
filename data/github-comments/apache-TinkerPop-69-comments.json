Not sure how others feel but I'm hesitant to include another dependency here to solve this, especially a deprecated one that is not maintained anymore. it's also changing gryo which would make server backward incompatible with drivers, e.g. 3.5.6 server would stop working with a 3.5.5 driver. gryo is deprecated i suppose but i'd say it remains a concern in my mind. \r\n\r\nGiven those issues, I'd like this approach to be a last resort and even then I'd consider relegating it to a newer version that doesn't break compatibility. Do you feel like we have reached a position of last resort at this point? If so, could you share other approaches you've tried that didn't really work well?\r\n\r\nthanks for your patience on this - sometimes the smallest bugs can be a nuisance to fix and generate a lot of

this is a bit old now, but it seems we must revisit it. the fix mentioned here is being rolled back for 3.5.6/3.6.3. that extra recursion is proving too costly. please see the latest work on this here: https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2026 if you find the `Graph` still isn't there for some reason, you can pull it with `Traversal.getRoot(traversal).getGraph()` or in the worst case, we might want to look into figuring out where else we might get the `Graph` assigned as part of traversal construction, but so far, five graph implementations seem ok with how this change works.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1513638447/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1513657376","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2007#issuecomment-1513657376","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/2007","id":1513657376,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc5aOJQg","user":{"login":"kenhuuu","id":106191785,"node_id":"U_kgDOBlRbqQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/106191785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kenhuuu","html_url":"https://github.com/kenhuuu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kenhuuu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kenhuuu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kenhuuu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kenhuuu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kenhuuu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kenhuuu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kenhuuu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kenhuuu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kenhuuu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-18T19:00:16Z","updated_at":"2023-04-18T19:00:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"VOTE

Overall they look good to me. My main question is if we've actually covered all the correct steps with these marker interfaces. By the look of it, this PR is just updating all of the steps which previously implemented the Mutating interface which in theory is sufficient. I wonder though if some consideration should be given into adding these markers to `io()` and possibly `call()` as well.\r\n\r\nAlso I wanted to ask if the `findPossibleTraversalStepsForModulatorOperators()` test is necessary as it appears to me that all of those modulators should already be tested by `findPossibleTraversalSteps()`. It is possible I'm misunderstanding this though so please correct me if I'm wrong.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1513942195/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1514008623","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2027#issuecomment-1514008623","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/2027","id":1514008623,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc5aPfAv","user":{"login":"porunov","id":17673243,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NjczMjQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17673243?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/porunov","html_url":"https://github.com/porunov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/porunov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/porunov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/porunov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/porunov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/porunov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/porunov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/porunov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/porunov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/porunov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-19T01:30:08Z","updated_at":"2023-04-19T01:30:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Thanks @porunov for submitting this PR.

I think that providers will just need to account for those steps as special cases rather than test them for `Writing` or `Deleting`. for example analyzing `call()` bytecode might require the additional check of examining the service being called for that step to determine its action. so, long story short, it was good to call those steps out, but i don't think they can implement any part of the `Mutating` interface the way it is defined.
