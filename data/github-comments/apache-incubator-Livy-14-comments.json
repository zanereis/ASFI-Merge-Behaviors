impersonation, do you mean that the Spark application Livy spawns (to run queries) is run as the user connecting to the Thrift server? I have a user kinit'd, let's say using principal testuser, who connects via beeline to the Thrift server; and the Spark application for the session runs as testuser. If this is what you mean, then impersonation is working.\r\n\r\nI tested my patch using both binary and http mode. In binary mode, everything works as I expect. In http mode, everything still works, except that on the server side, there are many exceptions logged, due to\r\n`Caused by: org.apache.hive.service.auth.HttpAuthenticationException: Authorization header received from the client is empty.\r\n`\r\nbut they do not cause any failure. I believe these exceptions are an unrelated issue.\r\n\r\nWithout my patch, I am able to connect when using http mode (the same slew of exceptions about the empty authorization header also occur in the server log), but I am unable to connect when using binary mode, due to the error as described in JIRA.\r\nThus I fail to see why you say the existing behavior is correct.\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the binary mode case, and as far as I can tell, does not break existing behavior.\r\nIf you think the existing behavior is correct, and that the failure I experience in binary mode is due to some kind of misconfiguration or user error, I'd very much appreciate knowing what configuration I need to correct or what I am missing in my beeline command.

If this is what you mean, then impersonation is working.\r\n\r\nyes, that is impersonation. Yes, it may not be a problem because in your case you're forcing to use the HTTP principal only for the authentication, but the livy one is used everywhere else, the problem in this case would be token renewal most likely...you are creating the UGI once and never renewing it, so it would not work after 1 week or even 1 day

The docs should actually be treated as separate from the rest of the Livy server files then.

I believe this PR should resolve issues with running the Livy server on Windows (at least with my tests). However it does not resolve *developing* on windows.

However at the very least this PR should allow users to run a Livy server on a Windows machine, and with the changes it brings, it shouldn't be too hard to then resolve LIVY-611.

Currently when getting active jobs, there's no direct relation to jobId.\r\n> 2. There's already a way to calculate job progress in ReplDriver for statement, we should extend the current way to also apply to job API.\r\n> 3. Using LivyServer to store the session/job status may not be fault tolerant.

Spark JobGroup is set as SqlJob's statementId, and if I want to get this statementId in JobWrapper or RscDriver, I must convert JobWrapper's Job to SqlJob, this needs SqlJob's definition, as SqlJob is in thriftserver module, importing its definition in rsc module may not be a good way. Could you please give me some advice?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/comments/545715699/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/comments/546271096","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-livy/pull/247#issuecomment-546271096","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/247","id":546271096,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NjI3MTA5Ng==","user":{"login":"mgaido91","id":8821783,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MjE3ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8821783?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91","html_url":"https://github.com/mgaido91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-25T09:07:02Z","updated_at":"2019-10-25T09:07:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@runzhiwang I see you point.

Service account may have been revoked. pods is forbidden: User \"system:serviceaccount:<namespace:serviceaccount\" cannot list resource \"pods\" in API group \"\" at the cluster scope.We have seen that the api tries to find pods in all the cluster due to which we are seeing this error.Is there any way we can limit the pod or driver lookup limited to the namespace we have provided.\r\n> Could you please let us know how to overcome this error.\r\n\r\nHi, you need the appropriate RBAC configured for the Livy pod. You can refer the example [here](https://github.com/jahstreet/spark-on-kubernetes-helm/blob/master/charts/livy/templates/rbac.yaml). At present it is tended to be configured with the ClusterRole. To limit that a little patch is required. I see why you may need that to be supported.\r\nFollowing the @mgaido91 review I will split this PR to multiple and will take into account your comment.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/comments/546592801/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/comments/546592984","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-livy/pull/167#issuecomment-546592984","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/167","id":546592984,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NjU5Mjk4NA==","user":{"login":"jahstreet","id":19328972,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzI4OTcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19328972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jahstreet","html_url":"https://github.com/jahstreet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jahstreet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jahstreet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jahstreet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jahstreet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jahstreet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jahstreet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jahstreet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jahstreet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jahstreet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-26T11:06:15Z","updated_at":"2019-10-26T11:06:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mgaido91 Thanks for the review.

A string. What does that column contain? A decimal. Hence both answers are correct somehow: one refers to what is returned to the client, the other to how data is stored in the table/backend. For this reason, I think having a flag which lets the user customize/choose the more appropriate behavior to him is the best option.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/comments/547007658/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/comments/547241470","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-livy/pull/238#issuecomment-547241470","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/238","id":547241470,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NzI0MTQ3MA==","user":{"login":"captainzmc","id":13825159,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODI1MTU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13825159?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/captainzmc","html_url":"https://github.com/captainzmc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/captainzmc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/captainzmc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/captainzmc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/captainzmc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/captainzmc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/captainzmc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/captainzmc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/captainzmc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/captainzmc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-29T03:34:31Z","updated_at":"2019-10-29T03:34:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> > > Rethink about the way this ticket doing, I think current way may not be the best way.\r\n> > > \r\n> > > 1. `jobId` may not exactly match the currently running jobs, there's no issue for beeline, but could be an issue for multi-thread usage.

Using pull based way in client side is a reasonable way, I'm gonna change this implement.\r\n\r\nI don't think your main concern is a problem, on the one hand, we print detailed process messages of the job(like completed, active, etc), to some entent, these messages, which can be update in a certain intervel, can give end users enough information of their jobs, so at least they know how their jobs are running. On the other hand, I don't think there is a truly trusted percentage in a distribute system, hive may also show wrong percentages if a task is failed or hang there.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/comments/548753453/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/comments/548763415","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-livy/pull/238#issuecomment-548763415","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/238","id":548763415,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0ODc2MzQxNQ==","user":{"login":"boneanxs","id":10115332,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTE1MzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10115332?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneanxs","html_url":"https://github.com/boneanxs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneanxs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneanxs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneanxs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneanxs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneanxs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneanxs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneanxs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneanxs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneanxs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-01T11:58:11Z","updated_at":"2019-11-01T11:58:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> 1.
