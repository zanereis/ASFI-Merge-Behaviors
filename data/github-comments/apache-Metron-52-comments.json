was a lot of good discussion on this, but I find it hard to summarize completely the positions of everyone including @mattf-horton and @cestella.  Here is my attempt in trying to do that.  Please correct anything that I have misstated.\r\n\r\n1. Everyone agreed that a ToC (table of contents) is a useful additional feature for the Profiler.  The decodable row key would be needed in addition to, not instead of, a ToC.\r\n\r\n1. In implementing a decodable row key, we do need to plan for future changes in row key format.  This was handled in this PR, but can be improved.\r\n\r\n1. The decodable row key feature should be completed **before** a ToC so that the row keys can be used to generate (or regenerate) a ToC on-demand.\r\n\r\n1. There were various suggestions made on how to shorten up the row key format.  Some of those I completed on this PR (like using a murmur hash) and others (like using shorts instead of ints) I would need to incorporate in a future PR for a decodable row key.\r\n\r\n1. There is a need for a migration tool.  A tool that can read the existing row key format and rewrite the same data using a new format.

Which one would you guys prefer:\r\n\r\n* display names in the mpack of \"Elasticsearch\" and \"HDFS\"\r\n* variable prefixes of es and hdfs\r\nI think I'd prefer the first as I really have been trying to set us up to a world where we can make things pluggable (this is the first baby step).\r\n```\r\n\r\nNobody commented on that, so I went with adjusting the display names rather than variable prefixes.  The reason why I preferred to do that was that when we do a better job of including Solr or other indices, prefixing the variables `elasticsearch` will be confusing.  The flux files are generic to the writer type for the random access indices.  I can understand the confusion for the user given we only really support HDFS and elasticsearch right now, which is why I changed the display names and kept the command line clients named as they were before.  Eventually, when we provide actual proper extension points to the indices, we should genericize the display names and scripts IMO.\r\n\r\nCan we recap the reasons against this approach?\r\n  ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/355346037/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/355381937","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/886#issuecomment-355381937","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/886","id":355381937,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NTM4MTkzNw==","user":{"login":"justinleet","id":5077341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzczNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5077341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet","html_url":"https://github.com/justinleet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-04T19:53:58Z","updated_at":"2018-01-04T19:53:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 by inspection.

I'm looking for a dynamic way to manage the endpoints, in the future (not for this PR). For instance, we currently have this to load the config (in master)\r\n\r\n```\r\n# common-services/METRON/CURRENT/package/scripts/params/params_linux.py\r\n# Indexing\r\nindexing_kafka_start = config['configurations']['metron-indexing-env']['indexing_kafka_start']\r\n```\r\nThis PR currently sets `ra_indexing_kafka_start` as the property name and `Elasticsearch Indexing Offset` as the display name. I think this is fine, but I'm unclear how best to manage 1..n indexing endpoints in later PR's because I don't know that Ambari (yet) offers a way to have dynamic config based on the type of service you choose to install. Maybe we can leverage a dropdown option as part of metron-env that we then leverage to dynamically choose the indexing config type you selected. So metron-env has the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<property>\r\n        <name>ra_indexing_framework</name>\r\n        <description>How you like to index for RA, friend?</description>\r\n        <value>Elasticsearch</value>\r\n        <display-name>Indexing Framework for Random Access</display-name>\r\n        <value-attributes>\r\n            <type>value-list</type>\r\n            <entries>\r\n                <entry>\r\n                    <value>Elasticsearch</value>\r\n                </entry>\r\n                <entry>\r\n                    <value>Solr</value>\r\n                </entry>\r\n            </entries>\r\n            <selection-cardinality>1</selection-cardinality>\r\n        </value-attributes>\r\n    </property>\r\n```\r\n\r\nand the earlier snippet above looks something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# common-services/METRON/CURRENT/package/scripts/params/params_linux.py\r\n# Indexing\r\nindexing_kafka_start = config['configurations'][ra_indexing_framework + '-env']['indexing_kafka_start']\r\n```\r\n\r\nNot sure if you can do that, just thinking out loud. Also, this handles the ability to plug in multiple providers from which you can select only one, but it does not handle the 1..n providers scenario simultaneously, if there were such a need.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/355425871/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/355551194","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/786#issuecomment-355551194","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/786","id":355551194,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NTU1MTE5NA==","user":{"login":"justinleet","id":5077341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzczNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5077341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet","html_url":"https://github.com/justinleet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-05T13:11:05Z","updated_at":"2018-01-05T13:11:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I took a swing through this, and generally this worked as expected.

This PR *is* how *I* would like it.   I'm just going to copy this here to justify my position:\r\n\r\n> The reason why I preferred to do that was that when we do a better job of including Solr or other \r\n> indices, prefixing the variables elasticsearch will be confusing. The flux files are generic to the \r\n> writer type for the random access indices. I can understand the confusion for the user given we \r\n> only really support HDFS and elasticsearch right now, which is why I changed the display names \r\n> and kept the command line clients named as they were before. Eventually, when we provide actual \r\n> proper extension points to the indices, we should genericize the display names and scripts IMO.\r\n\r\nIt boils down to the fact that it may seem odd now since we primarily use ES and HDFS indices, we will have the ability to have users plug in their own idices and, IMO, it makes more sense to name them in the backend, after their data access pattern rather than the technology.

Having a default that each user gets if they don't do anything seems appropriate, but I'd expect different people to want to be looking at different things.\r\n1. The DB feels like a reasonable place for this to live.  We're already storing some per user type data (e.g. recent searches) in the DB, right?\r\n1. It would be nice to have (and this would be follow-on), a really easy UI way to adjust the facet fields.  Especially, if it's that adjustable on the fly, I don't think we need versioning on the user level facet configs.\r\n1. IMO, having the defaults be versioned is nice, but not mandatory (we don't version anything in that file, do we?)\r\n1. Re: the upgrade issue.  We generally don't support upgrades, but having the upgrading.md have a note along with at least a couple of the basic commands to add that field would be nice.\r\n1. I'd have a slight inclination towards empty facet array being default and missing being disable.  It's more intuitive for me that if I leave it out of the request, it's not present.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/356350839/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/356359002","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/891#issuecomment-356359002","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/891","id":356359002,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NjM1OTAwMg==","user":{"login":"merrimanr","id":311928,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTkyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/311928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr","html_url":"https://github.com/merrimanr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-09T17:41:51Z","updated_at":"2018-01-09T17:41:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@MohanDV this is a good start and will be a nice feature to have.
