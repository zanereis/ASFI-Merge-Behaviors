We could use that with 0.9 too but it makes clients depend on the kafka (core/server) jar which can make it bulky for an app whose need is just for kafka-clients and also we will still need to do the

The fact that TopicAndPartition was Serializable was kind of accidental (one sadly gets that automatically when using case classes).\n\nIf we do decide to support Java Serialization in some of our classes, we should do that with a good understanding of what it means if we need to change them in the future.

We only have one `Authorizer` implementation, so the parameter kind of makes sense in the scope of only Kafka's tests, but we should think of the `Service` classes as semi-public interfaces we want to be careful about changing -- they should be reusable by others to write system tests. If anyone wanted to test other authorizer implementations, I think the current `use_authorizer` parameters wouldn't be a great solution -- they'd have to add still another option (or make assumptions about the implementation by setting the `authorizer_class_name` field on `KafkaService` directly).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/167010840/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/167023193","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/711#issuecomment-167023193","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/711","id":167023193,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NzAyMzE5Mw==","user":{"login":"praveend","id":194470,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDQ3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/194470?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/praveend","html_url":"https://github.com/praveend","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praveend/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praveend/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praveend/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praveend/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praveend/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praveend/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praveend/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praveend/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praveend/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-24T02:01:09Z","updated_at":"2015-12-24T02:01:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ewencp

Right now we're running into some internal Jenkins issues because we have changes to this branch which are still being called \"0.9.0.0\" and cause downstream issues in our schema-registry code. This is difficult/annoying to fix without Kafka making a clear distinction between versions and when code should be considered a SNAPSHOT (which can also cause builds to break, but at least is expected).\n\nAnother alternative would be to change this to 0.9.0.1 immediately instead of 0.9.0.1-SNAPSHOT, although personally I prefer starting to be more careful about marking code that isn't released and should not be considered stable as such.\n\n/cc @junrao @gwenshap @ijuma \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/168765186/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/168766114","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/727#issuecomment-168766114","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/727","id":168766114,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2ODc2NjExNA==","user":{"login":"gwenshap","id":1189030,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODkwMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1189030?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap","html_url":"https://github.com/gwenshap","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-04T18:49:54Z","updated_at":"2016-01-04T18:49:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"We usually self-commit the version bumps :) Anyway, LGTM.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/168766114/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/168768649","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/727#issuecomment-168768649","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/727","id":168768649,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2ODc2ODY0OQ==","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-04T18:56:09Z","updated_at":"2016-01-04T18:56:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"LGTM.
