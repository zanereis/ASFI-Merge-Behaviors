Thank you Lewis. I think there has been great work from you and many others who contributed to Apache Gora from the beginning. That made project shaped into what we have today. I also got opportunity be Apache release manager, since this is my first release.\r\n\r\nThere are lots of good work coming up for the next release. We will have a discussion on what we have done already, what we need to do for our next release.

Thank you for addressing my review comments. I ll let others to have a look as well. I do have a very minor concern on test running time which is - it takes around 13 minutes to complete on my local machine. Do you think further we can improve on this? ( Reducing embedded server startup/stop etc. ) \r\n\r\nAs per the offline chat we had, lets separately address these concerns, hadoop-commons transitive dependency issue etc. We will also probably need documentation for gora site, adding hive datastore dependencies gora-tutorial, further improve on mapping files tests, mapreduce/flink/spark workloads tests to hive datastore, test cases which currently dissabled. You can address these in separate Jira tickets. \r\n\r\nI think we are are good to go with the initial version hive datastore.

I think queries like INSERT are bit slower in hive compared to other data stores like Hbase. The main reason is hive executes MapReduce jobs and partitioning jobs to perform such tasks [1].
