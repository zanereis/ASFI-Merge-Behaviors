Thanks for your reply!\r\n\r\n> Add alert_strategy in t_ds_alert table\r\n> According to my understanding, this field should be \"process/task state\"?\r\n\r\nYes, you are right. Maybe change the COMMENT to below is more clear.\r\n`alert_strategy tinyint(4) NOT NULL COMMENT 'Alert strategy: 0 process/task is successfully, 1 process/task is failed'.`\r\n\r\n> When process/task finish, alert can only be triggered once, and 't_ds_alert' will only have one data about this process/task.\r\n\r\nThat's right. Only one record will be inserted in 't_ds_alert' when process/task is finished. But process/task binds the alert group, and multiple instances of multiple alert methods can be created in an alert group. The design document is [here](https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/3049#issue-644380894). The source code is [here](https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/blob/2.0.2-release/dolphinscheduler-alert/dolphinscheduler-alert-server/src/main/java/org/apache/dolphinscheduler/alert/AlertSender.java#L54).\r\n\r\n> At the same time, we need to consider not only success and failure, but also others, such as pause and stop, and possible increase in the future\r\n\r\nYes, I agree with you. And I think we can do step-by-step iterations. In the further, we can support more scenes, such as pause and stop you said, and maybe online and offline. The current architecture is supported.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1015136643/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1015142363","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/pull/8100#issuecomment-1015142363","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/8100","id":1015142363,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms48gdfb","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-18T07:36:35Z","updated_at":"2022-01-18T07:36:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#
