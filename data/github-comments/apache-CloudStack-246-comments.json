If I use the git history in Intellij I don't loose any commits. If I run in the new file directory a `git log --follow <my_file>` I can see the full history of that file too. The blame function on a file on Github does show each referring commit per line.\r\nThe only lost history is the \"History\" button on github website, which isn't nice I agree since I'm using it quite often. I'm surprised they don't use `--follow` to display the full history.
