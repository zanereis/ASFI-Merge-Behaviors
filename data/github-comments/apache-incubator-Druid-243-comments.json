There should be something that shows what the test threads were doing in the thread dump if you dumped while the test was running. \r\n\r\nWhat `SegmentManagerThreadSafetyTest` does is basically creating 88 files of 15 bytes each and copying those files into another directory using 4 threads. Both directories where those files are created and copied to are under your temp directory in your local disk.

I will post again if I figure something out.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/502238061/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/502266819","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/7810#issuecomment-502266819","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7810","id":502266819,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMjI2NjgxOQ==","user":{"login":"clintropolis","id":1577461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzc0NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1577461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis","html_url":"https://github.com/clintropolis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-14T21:20:02Z","updated_at":"2019-06-14T21:20:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Apologies for the delay getting this merged, got busy with some stuff, thanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/502266819/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/502268573","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/7838#issuecomment-502268573","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7838","id":502268573,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMjI2ODU3Mw==","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-14T21:27:03Z","updated_at":"2019-06-14T21:27:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @eranmeir, thanks for your contribution! It looks that the PDF you attached shows we can gain some performance benefit with this PR when multiple threads write into the same incremental index. But, I'm wondering if we need that kind of performance benefit. Currently, the most common use case is serving multiple queries from different threads while building an incremental index with a single thread. So, it's like the single write and multiple reads case. Also, in indexing, the most expensive part is I think segment merge rather than building incremental indexes.\r\n\r\nWould you elaborate more on your plan regarding this point of view? More specifically, do you see something we can do better when multiple threads write into the same incremental index?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/502268573/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/502277035","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/7894#issuecomment-502277035","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7894","id":502277035,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMjI3NzAzNQ==","user":{"login":"clintropolis","id":1577461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzc0NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1577461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis","html_url":"https://github.com/clintropolis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-14T21:32:12Z","updated_at":"2019-06-14T21:32:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"[Travis failure looks maybe legitimate:](https://travis-ci.org/apache/incubator-druid/jobs/545864160#L9685) \r\n```\r\n[ERROR] Failed to execute goal com.github.spotbugs:spotbugs-maven-plugin:3.1.12:check (default-cli) on project druid-datasketches: failed with 1 bugs and 0 errors -> [Help 1]\r\n[ERROR] Failed to execute goal com.github.spotbugs:spotbugs-maven-plugin:3.1.12:check (default-cli) on project druid-influx-extensions: failed with 3 bugs and 0 errors -> [Help 1]\r\n[ERROR] Failed to execute goal com.github.spotbugs:spotbugs-maven-plugin:3.1.12:check (default-cli) on project ambari-metrics-emitter: failed with 1 bugs and 0 errors -> [Help 1]\r\n[ERROR] Failed to execute goal com.github.spotbugs:spotbugs-maven-plugin:3.1.12:check (default-cli) on project druid-momentsketch: failed with 1 bugs and 0 errors -> [Help 1]\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/502277035/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/502293675","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/7588#issuecomment-502293675","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7588","id":502293675,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMjI5MzY3NQ==","user":{"login":"clintropolis","id":1577461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzc0NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1577461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis","html_url":"https://github.com/clintropolis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-14T22:01:23Z","updated_at":"2019-06-14T22:01:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I would like to do ingestion side support through transforms as a follow-up PR, I think maybe it could benefit from a slight refactoring and this PR is already big enough.\r\n\r\nThis PR should have no effect on multi-value dimensions used in transform spec, because it appears to already behave differently than the expression selectors in that instead of array values being translated to `null` for the expression they are instead fed into `String.valueOf` so they appear as a scalar string. As expected, using the array functions from this PR at ingestion time can have unexpected results because of the scalar string behavior and also lack of array result to list of string coercion on the expression outputs, but because of the string behavior it appears that this is also true of any expression on multi-value ingestion time inputs.\r\n\r\nI think my main outstanding question for this PR is whether or not this new expression selector behavior should be optional for now, because there is a potential performance impact for expression selectors with bindings from row based selectors since they will have to use `RowBasedExpressionColumnValueSelector` with it's per row check of input binding type. I do hope to eliminate nearly all of these cases in future work by enhancing the type information throughout the query pipeline, but i'm not certain how far in the future that actually is and I haven't had the chance to conduct thorough measurements on performance difference, which is why I brought this up. Also I could see a use for turning off this behavior if certain there are no multi-value dimensions. On the other hand though, we have a lot of options, I'm not sure we need more. Maybe some of the improvements done in this PR, like argument validation for functions being done at parse time instead of for each eval, make up enough for the `RowBasedExpressionColumnValueSelector` phase that it about evens out.

Afaik, filtering using the index(es) occurs prior to batching.  When the historical reads rows into a batch (see `ScanQueryLimitRowIterator.java` for reference), this batch only contains filtered records.  Then, batches of `batchSize` rows are streamed back to the broker until `limit` rows have been returned (the only edge case being the last batch which might contain fewer than `batchSize` rows to avoid exceeding `limit`).\r\n\r\nThis differs from your understanding in that you're assuming that every row is being scanned and filtered through.  Rather than combining rows into batches prior to filtering, batching is used to combine results after filtering to be streamed back.\r\n\r\nReferring to the doc example, the `batchSize` property actually corresponds to a **maximum** batch size.

If yes, then it probably can't be the memory used to load the segments in page cache as that doesn't count towards anonymous memory usage. So, that means the process really allocated loads of direct memory using those buffers you mentioned. \r\nThere could be a genuine memory leak there. You can identify that by doing a manual GC (e.g. using \"jcmd <pid> GC.run\" )  at time of high direct memory use, if GC frees up a whole bunch of direct memory then there is almost certainly a memory leak and we are not \"closing/cleaning\" discarded off-heap buffers. If you find that, you can try to then identify which buffers are we not cleaning up and/or create another ticket with your task log and analysis , someone else from community might be able to look into it.\r\nIf GC does not free significant direct memory that means all that memory is really in use and code needs optimization to reduce its memory usage. My suspicion is that, most of that off-heap buffers are probably being used to merge the intermediate persisted segment merging , playing with some of configuration described in https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/ingestion/native_tasks.html#tuningconfig might increase/decrease off heap memory usage.  (especially maxRowsInMemory, maxBytesInMemory, maxTotalRows .. try reducing maxTotalRows )\r\n\r\nCheck whether segment handoffs are working fine, you can add \"pushTimeout\" setting from above if need be.\r\n\r\nyou might be hitting issue described in https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/pull/6699 , if you can build druid with that patch applied then try that.\r\n\r\nThat said, please attache the task log of the process that ends up dead due to too much memory usage. I will take a quick look to see if there is something obvious that shows up.\r\n\r\nHTH.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/502412342/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/502417029","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/7824#issuecomment-502417029","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7824","id":502417029,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMjQxNzAyOQ==","user":{"login":"quenlang","id":11764573,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzY0NTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11764573?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/quenlang","html_url":"https://github.com/quenlang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quenlang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quenlang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quenlang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quenlang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quenlang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quenlang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quenlang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quenlang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quenlang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-16T03:40:53Z","updated_at":"2019-06-16T03:40:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@himanshug Thank you so much for the quick replay!\r\nI had performed a manual GC with using ```jcmd GC.run```, but did not free up the direct memory.\r\nThe task log of the process that ends up dead due to too much memory usage as below.\r\nThanks !\r\n```\r\n2019-06-14T06:24:10,907 INFO [appenderator_merge_0] org.apache.druid.segment.realtime.appenderator.AppenderatorImpl -

I think there are too many intermediate persists because of `maxBytesInMemory` which in your case , by default, is `2g/6 = 341M` . OnHeapIncrementalIndex does overestimate the size due to sketches in there and might be persisting segments too aggressively. \r\n\r\nHere is what I would try out...\r\n\r\nset maxBytesInMemory = Integer.MAX_VALUE (to effectively disable it)\r\nadjust `maxRowsInMemory` (default 1000000) to a lower value or increase Xmx on task process so that it doesn't get into too much of GC . You might have to adjust `druid.worker.capacity=10` to a lower value if Xmx was increased. Now find the right balance of `maxRowsInMemory` and `Xmx` on task process so that you don't end up with thousands of segments to merge in the end but much lower number. That will drive down the off-heap buffer allocation .\r\n(Higher `maxRowsInMemory` means lower the number of segments to merge in the end but higher jvm heap utilization

I will soon add a commit that addresses the issues you raise. I have updated the attached pdf with raw numbers of pre- and post-fix benchmarks.\r\n\r\n@jihoonson Thanks for the feedback. We used Oak for indexing large amounts of data and saw significant performance gains from off-heap storage and multi-threaded indexing. This separate PR may be thought of as ground work for Oak, but multi-threaded performance gains are obviously independent. \r\n\r\nThe way I understand what you write, queries that happen before segment merge may benefit from increase in indexing throughput. \r\n\r\nWe haven't tried comparing costs of index building and segment merging. Perhaps we can try and leverage multi-threading in the merge process. I'll be happy to discuss this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/502591292/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/502610905","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/7838#issuecomment-502610905","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7838","id":502610905,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMjYxMDkwNQ==","user":{"login":"sanastas","id":12136181,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTM2MTgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12136181?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanastas","html_url":"https://github.com/sanastas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanastas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanastas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanastas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanastas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanastas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanastas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanastas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanastas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanastas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-17T09:37:54Z","updated_at":"2019-06-17T09:37:54Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@jihoonson , indeed thank you for raising this important question! I would like to add a bit to @eranmeir answer.\r\n\r\nWithout relevance to Oak, it might be interesting that other databases found it beneficial to make the inserts to in-memory component concurrent. Here is a [link](http://webee.technion.ac.il/~idish/ftp/clsm.pdf) to academic paper about cLSM (concurrent LSM) showing benefits from making in-memory component concurrent. And here are RocksDB [release notes](https://rocksdb.org/blog/2017/01/06/rocksdb-5-0-1-released.html) from 2017 presenting concurrent writes to memtable enabled as a default: \r\n> Options::allow_concurrent_memtable_write and Options::enable_write_thread_adaptive_yield are now true by default.\r\n\r\nAnd with relevance to Oak, OakMap brings with it two benefits: (1) taking the key-value mapping off-heap, (2) high multi-threading scalability. Due to off-heaping, the Oak-based IncrementalIndex might manage more data in-memory thus require less often flushes to disk. Such IncrementalIndex might be responsible for a bigger keys partition and that way cause *less merges*. Clearly, managing bigger map is more efficient when multi-thread writes are allowed and are efficient.  \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/502610905/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/502616808","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/7875#issuecomment-502616808","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7875","id":502616808,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMjYxNjgwOA==","user":{"login":"sashidhar","id":287761,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4Nzc2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/287761?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sashidhar","html_url":"https://github.com/sashidhar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sashidhar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sashidhar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sashidhar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sashidhar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sashidhar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sashidhar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sashidhar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sashidhar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sashidhar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-17T09:55:24Z","updated_at":"2019-06-17T09:55:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@dclim I would like to work on this improvement.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/502616808/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/502643909","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/7875#issuecomment-502643909","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7875","id":502643909,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMjY0MzkwOQ==","user":{"login":"sashidhar","id":287761,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4Nzc2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/287761?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sashidhar","html_url":"https://github.com/sashidhar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sashidhar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sashidhar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sashidhar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sashidhar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sashidhar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sashidhar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sashidhar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sashidhar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sashidhar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-17T11:27:05Z","updated_at":"2019-06-17T11:29:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@dclim  Please look at my questions and comments at https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/pull/7907/files.   \r\n\r\nOther questions:\r\n\r\n1.
