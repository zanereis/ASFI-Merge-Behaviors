There are no errors visible in the logs. The query simply does not find any data. But this does not seem to be an error for Impala. I have exported the query plan. This is the only thing I can offer. Additionally I have created an external partitioned table, which is only saved in parquet format without hudi.  For comparison I attach this query plan too. In particular, differences in the query plans are visible in the recognition of the partitions (see \"00:SCAN HDFS\"). Hope this helps.

During write table metadata was enabled (`HoodieMetadataConfig.ENABLE.key -> \"true\"`), but during read I disabled it. My initial intuition was to use table metadata, but using it didn't bring much improvement. I think that scanning HFile in [HoodieHFileReader::getRecordByKey](https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/69ee790a47a5fa90a6acd954a9330cce3ae31c3b/hudi-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/io/storage/HoodieHFileReader.java#L249) for each partition with disabled block caching may make the whole process longer.\r\n\r\nI have run `org.apache.hudi.utilities.HoodieCleaner` with configs that you suggested, but clean operation has done nothing and finished after 30 seconds:\r\n```\r\n22/03/02 16:27:39 INFO AbstractTableFileSystemView: Took 9902 ms to read  17 instants, 15201 replaced file groups\r\n22/03/02 16:27:39 INFO ClusteringUtils: Found 0 files in pending clustering operations\r\n22/03/02 16:27:39 INFO S3NativeFileSystem: Opening 's3://bucket/table/.hoodie/20220124110227018.clean' for reading\r\n22/03/02 16:27:40 INFO CleanPlanner: Incremental Cleaning mode is enabled.

It is already clean\r\n```\r\n\r\nI lowered config values and run HoodieCleaner again. This time I could see that it actually did something. Config parameters that I have used:\r\n```\r\nhoodie.cleaner.commits.retained = 5\r\nhoodie.keep.min.commits = 6\r\nhoodie.keep.max.commits = 7\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can see that during read it loads the latest instance (`20220302163151203__clean__COMPLETED`), but it had no impact on reading performance whatsoever:\r\n```\r\n22/03/02 16:35:27 INFO HoodieActiveTimeline: Loaded instants upto : Option{val=[20220302163151203__clean__COMPLETED]}\r\n22/03/02 16:35:27 INFO FileSystemViewManager: Creating InMemory based view for basePath s3://bucket/table\r\n22/03/02 16:35:35 INFO AbstractTableFileSystemView: Took 8784 ms to read  17 instants, 15201 replaced file groups\r\n22/03/02 16:35:35 INFO ClusteringUtils: Found 0 files in pending clustering operations\r\n22/03/02 16:35:35 INFO AbstractTableFileSystemView: Building file system view for partition (date=2022-01-01/source=test/type=test)\r\n22/03/02 16:35:35 INFO AbstractTableFileSystemView: addFilesToView: NumFiles=40, NumFileGroups=39, FileGroupsCreationTime=3, StoreTimeTaken=0\r\n22/03/02 16:35:35 INFO HoodieROTablePathFilter: Based on hoodie metadata from base path: s3://bucket/table, caching 39 files under s3://bucket/table/date=2022-01-01/source=test/type=test\r\n22/03/02 16:35:44 INFO AbstractTableFileSystemView: Took 8541 ms to read  17 instants, 15201 replaced file groups\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also tested reading the table with the latest version of Hudi `v0.10.1`.  It improved a read time from 132 to 65 seconds, but that's still a considerable amount of time.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1057245313/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1057345020","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/4927#issuecomment-1057345020","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4927","id":1057345020,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM4_Bc38","user":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-02T20:25:19Z","updated_at":"2022-03-02T20:25:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@danny0405 : here is the intention with this patch.

We chose to abandon delete block mechanism and treat all records as mutation on possibly existing record. \r\n1. Remove the logic to handle '_hoodie_is_deleted' in getInsertValue method in payload so that this method always return a non-empty generic record. \r\n2. When we meet a delete record, return a record which has filed '_hoodie_is_deleted' is true and ordering value field. I think this may be similar to the tombstone mentioned by @alexeykudinkin above.\r\n3. Store all records in data block in which some of them is actually delete marker record in step 2. \r\n4. Handle physical deletion in HoodieMergeHandle/ createHandle. We have already take deletion into consider in combineAndGetUpdateValue. But we removed the logic in getInsertValue before. Add it back in HoodieMergeHandle/HoodieCreateHandle because it is time to do physical operation.\r\n5. something more need to be deliberately considered. I think delete method should also be refactored. But in our case, we never call delete separately. So nothing has been done for it.\r\n\r\nPros: we reuse some existing logic and it should be backward-compatibility.\r\nCons: _hoodie_is_deleted is no longer an optional field in hudi. We have to treat it same as other meta fields in HoodieRecord. In addition to this, this method will waste little storage because _hoodie_is_deleted is stored in parquet and always false. Not sure if we can remove it or not. \r\n\r\nBesides, I would like to share some more information which helped me find this problem. This problem has bothered another MVCC storage engine for a long time. [Hbase limitation](https://hbase.apache.org/book.html#_current_limitations). And they have a trade-off solution finally [HBASE-15968](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-15968) similar to the conclusion mentioned by @nsivabalan .

helpful.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1057501670/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1057503160","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/4914#issuecomment-1057503160","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4914","id":1057503160,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM4_CDe4","user":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-02T23:38:03Z","updated_at":"2022-03-02T23:38:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"wrt

The upstream system periodically writes Hudi data to the object storage. The downstream system needs to know the changes of Hudi data. Currently, the upstream system can only periodically query Hudi snapshot information to determine whether Hudi table data has changed. Then the incremental calculation of the job is triggered. If there is a snapshot change notification mechanism (including partition change information). Users can customize the Listener to write the change message to Kafka, and the downstream system only needs to fetch the message from Kafka to know the data change.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1057570270/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1057603548","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/4724#issuecomment-1057603548","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4724","id":1057603548,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM4_Cb_c","user":{"login":"stayrascal","id":13775334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzc1MzM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13775334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stayrascal","html_url":"https://github.com/stayrascal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stayrascal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stayrascal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stayrascal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stayrascal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stayrascal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stayrascal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stayrascal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stayrascal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stayrascal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-03T02:28:36Z","updated_at":"2022-03-03T02:28:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> \r\n\r\nyeah, @LinMingQiang has mentioned this one above.\r\n\r\nFrom my understanding, if we want to enable \"partial update\" feature by defining customized payload class, it should running \"partial update\" in these three cases:\r\n-  merged the incoming batch records before write to disk\r\n-  read records from the log file(read from MOR table)\r\n-  read records from log file and compact into base file\r\n\r\nSo I also update the `HoodieMergedLogRecordScanner.processNextRecord ()` by passing Schema info, if the use case is not using \"partial update\" with other payload class, it will use the default `preCombine()` logic to choose \"recent\" one.\r\n\r\nThe current situation is that will we treat `preCombine` return one of two records, or we can merged them to a new record.\r\n\r\n> Just FYI for all interested folks.

How does normally people perform inline clustering or async clustering on partitions with large amount of data? Do you expect driver memory should be larger than the clustering data size?\r\n\r\nCurrently, [the union](https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/a4ba0fff07861bdff338074fb5d84726f430883f/hudi-client/hudi-spark-client/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/client/clustering/run/strategy/MultipleSparkJobExecutionStrategy.java#L108) will collect hudi records (as per the plan generated for corresponding replacecommit) into the driver.\r\n\r\n> What are the configurations I should be using to perform clustering on these large tables?\r\n> In PROD I will have 1.8 billion records (each record 3-4 KB in memory) on each day, so is it advised to perform clustering frequently (every 10 to 20 commits) or daily?\r\n\r\nAs you said, you could run clustering more frequently. Configs will also depend on clustering strategy. Looking at your configs, you can adjust the `hoodie.clustering.plan.strategy.daybased.lookback.partitions` to a lower value. You could also tune `hoodie.clustering.plan.strategy.small.file.limit` to a value such that even though each round of clustering is picking just a few partitions but it is able to utilize the memory as much as possible. What's the nature of your workload?
