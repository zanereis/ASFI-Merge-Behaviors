Here are some major points in this PR that need addressed:\n- Add note in PR master comment that hits PR is promoting QTL state to first class druid state object. And the proposed manager to be the manager for that state.\n- Expectations on registration behavior and process need clarified in concrete docs (probably in the manager class's javadoc)\n- LookupExtractor state lifecycle needs managed in consistent way and clear documentation on what those expectations are.\n- Proposed lookup state registration method eliminates the capacity to pass query time parameters to the LookupExtractor. For example: current namespace lookup extension allows the parameters `replaceMissingValueWith` and `retainMissingValue` at query time. The proposed management paradigm does not allow for usage of any such parameters. Or more specifically, requires registration of a new LookupExtractor for any unique combination of parameters.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/175811686/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/175819456","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1937#issuecomment-175819456","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1937","id":175819456,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3NTgxOTQ1Ng==","user":{"login":"estliberitas","id":568962,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODk2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568962?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/estliberitas","html_url":"https://github.com/estliberitas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/estliberitas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/estliberitas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/estliberitas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/estliberitas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/estliberitas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/estliberitas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/estliberitas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/estliberitas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/estliberitas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-27T19:46:01Z","updated_at":"2016-01-27T19:46:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@drcrallen Not yet.

@sirpkt , I've found that files. As I know, Druid create Segment files to store data and bitmap index. From your description, max line is 500,000. So if there are 1,000,000 lines of data, does Druid generate two Segment files?

I'm thinking of putting no authentication code inside druid-core , any AuthenticationFilter can be injected from the extension and extension writer can choose to use whatever mechanism fits for them. Only thing that would go inside druid-core will be an interface AuthorizationInfo and checks at jersey endpoints. AuthenticationFilter injected from the extension will be responsible for setting up an implementation of AuthorizationInfo in the context and individual jersey end points will use that to accept/deny/filter the request.\nHow the injected AuthenticationFilter authenticates and fills the AuthorizationInfo implementation is up to the extension implementation and different ways are possible.\n\nParag would soon do a PR and that might clarify things
