Tuning small.file.limit and max.file.size seem to have no noticeable impact, which is why having clustering is important (as the next time it writes to the same partition the hope is to combine the small files together)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1008283680/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1008300322","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/4238#issuecomment-1008300322","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4238","id":1008300322,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM48GXEi","user":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-09T13:40:31Z","updated_at":"2022-01-09T13:40:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing the issue.

@YuweiXiao Why not use `BaseFileWithLogsSplit` which maps matching log files to base files?\r\n\r\nActually, I tried with `BaseFileWithLogsSplit`. IIUC, we need to use `BaseFileWithLogsSplit` at the place where we generate the split, i.e., `HoodieInputFormatUtils::filterFileStatusForSnapshotMode`. By looking at its implementation, I found its semantic is to generate baseFile split and `log file only` file slice. And callers of this function rely on this semantic, such as bootstrap.
