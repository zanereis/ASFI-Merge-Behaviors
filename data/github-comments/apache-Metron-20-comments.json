Everything looked good, thanks for helping with that.\r\n\r\nI just submitted another commit with tests for the remaining services excluding TransformationValidationService (still thinking about how to rename that).  Will have that one done soon.  I also refactored the SensorParserConfigServiceImpl by removing all the Grok functions with the exception of the isGrokParser method.  The read/write methods for Grok statements are exactly the same as the read/write methods in the HdfsServiceImpl class and are not needed so I removed them.  I feel like the saveTemporary method should be in GrokServiceImpl so I moved it there.  With this change, SensorParserConfigServiceImpl more closely matches the other CRUD interfaces.  Let me know what you think about that.\r\n\r\nAs for the error you ran into, I have hit that as well many times while working on Metron.  The underlying problem is that the shade plugin is not correctly configured on the metron-statistics module.  The guava library is not shaded and the uber jar is installed instead of the regular jar.  This means you cannot exclude guava from the metron-statistics dependency and the version mismatch tends to show up at runtime.  I believe this problem is outside the scope of this PR and should be fixed separately.  There are other modules that have the same problem so those need to be fixed as well.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of guava, you might want to consider not using it in KafkaServiceImplTest.  That library is deprecated aggressively and has caused us a lot of problems because we depend on so many different projects that all use different guava versions.  Not a big deal if we do use it (we're using it directly in other Metron modules) but we might want to call that dependency out and use the Metron global guava version.  It looks like you're just using it for syntactical convenience and isn't critical so my preference would be to take it out.  I could be convinced otherwise if you think we'll need it down the road.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/276527891/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/276532346","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/316#issuecomment-276532346","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/316","id":276532346,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NjUzMjM0Ng==","user":{"login":"merrimanr","id":311928,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTkyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/311928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr","html_url":"https://github.com/merrimanr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-31T23:56:28Z","updated_at":"2017-01-31T23:56:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It just occurred to me that we don't have an HdfsController.

I'll remove my uses of it. Plus, Java has a lot of those functions built in now. No reason I shouldn't use those instead.\r\n\r\nI agree that the guava issue should be taken care of separately. Right now, I think we should allow a user to set an envitonment variable to point to which guava to use (similar to hibernate and mysql). This will make it easier for us to run it outside of our IDE.\r\n\r\nI think your changes look pretty good. Really nice clean up/tests. We've changed a lot, so I want to do another pass though.\r\n\r\nI think we should still have our `HdfsService`. Right now, I think using `FileSystem` directly works for us. Using Knox is a good idea, but it probably needs to be optional. My thought is having the service will help us achieve that. You are probably right though. If we can achieve everything with WebHDFS it's better for our service to use that. This PR is already really big though.

I'm not sure if you can get the raw version in GitHub like in Jira, so ping me if this isn't grabbable in the current form and I'll get it to you differently.\r\n\r\n### [Migrate Geo Enrichment outside of MySQL](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-283)\r\n\r\n#### Description\r\nAs of 0.3.0, a MySQL database was used for storage and retrieval of GeoIP information during enrichment.\r\nAs of 0.3.1, the MySQL database is removed in favor of using MaxMind's binary GeoIP files and stored on HDFS\r\n\r\nAfter initial setup, this change is transparent and existing enrichment definitions will run as-is.\r\n\r\n#### Migration\r\nWhile new installs will not require any additional steps, in an existing install a script must be run to retrieve and load the initial data.\r\n\r\nThe shell script `geo_enrichment_load.sh`  will retrieve MaxMind GeoLite2 data and load data into HDFS, and update the configuration to point to this data.\r\nIn most cases the following usage will grab the data appropriately:\r\n```\r\n$METRON_HOME/bin/geo_enrichment_load.sh -z <zk_server>:<zk_port>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditional options, including changing the source file location (which can be a file:// location if the GeoIP data is already downloaded), are available with the\r\n`-h` flag and are also detailed in the metron-data-management README.me file.\r\n\r\nOne caveat is that this script will NOT update on disk config files.  It is recommended to retrieve the configuration using\r\n```\r\n$METRON_HOME/bin/zk_load_configs.sh -z <zk_server>:<zk_port> -m DUMP\r\n```\r\nThe new config will be `geo.hdfs.file` in the global section of the configuration.  Append this key-value into the global.json in the config directory.
