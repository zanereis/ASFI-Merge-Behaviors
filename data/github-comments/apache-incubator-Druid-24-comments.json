Currently the thing that manages the locks (the lockbox) and the thing that interacts with ZK (the RTR) are totally separate. The contract is that the RTR needs to resolve the futures it returned from \"run\" when it decides that a task is no longer running, and as long as it does that correctly, the lockbox won't contain any stale locks that might cause deadlocks.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/110903045/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/110903747","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1417#issuecomment-110903747","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1417","id":110903747,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExMDkwMzc0Nw==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-10T20:33:17Z","updated_at":"2015-06-10T20:33:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think the current behavior if ZK is wiped while the overlord and middle managers are down is that the overlord will load up the marked-as-running tasks and their locks from the metadata storage, then pass them all to the RTR, which would cause them to start running again (since the RTR won't see any of the markers in ZK that indicated this was done already).

the extension class loader uses the root loader as a fallback, so anything on your root CLASSPATH that doesn't exist in extension dependency hierarchy (e.g. your yarn configs) will still be

If a `tieredReplicants` is NULL in json, should the resulting property be null or empty-map?\n2.

If I'm reading this correctly this PR changes such behavior.\n\nThere is precedence for such behavior in numerous other POJOs around Druid, but it would be nice to get the weigh-in of someone more familiar with the Replicant Tiering code to comment on if this change will be an issue.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/114924653/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/114926734","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1462#issuecomment-114926734","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1462","id":114926734,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNDkyNjczNA==","user":{"login":"pjain1","id":11787983,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzg3OTgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11787983?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjain1","html_url":"https://github.com/pjain1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjain1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjain1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjain1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjain1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjain1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjain1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjain1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjain1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjain1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-24T16:07:34Z","updated_at":"2015-06-24T16:07:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@drcrallen Yes it changes the behavior. `tieredReplicants` can be set to `null` instead of an empty Map however in that case wouldn't `getNumReplicants(String tier)` method and `getTieredReplicants()` in `run` method of `LoadRule` throw NPE?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/114926734/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
