LocalTransaction is executed after half message is successfully sent. A LocalTransaction may takes long time to complete, and while it is running , TransactionCheckerListener may be called to report the status of the transaction. It's very hard or even impossible for the TransactionCheckerListener to distinguish whether the transaction is on-going or is rollbacked.\r\nI'd propose a new programming model of TransactionMQProducer.\r\nStart local transaction\r\nexecute local transaction logic\r\nCall TransactionMQProducer to send half message and record SendResult\r\nCommit or Rollback local transaction based on SendResult.\r\nTell MQ the local transaction state.\r\nAccording to this design, there is no extract work to do after half message is sent, TransactionCheckerListener can be confident the transaction is rollbacked if it can find a record in the database. And Step 5 can be easily implemented using Spring Transaction bound event.\r\n—\r\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\r\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub,

When creating a topic in RocketMQ, call `createTopic(String key, String newTopic, int queueNum, int topicSysFlag)` to create the topic.

RocketMQ 创建 topic 的时候，调用`createTopic(String key, String newTopic, int queueNum, int topicSysFlag)`创建topic。这个方法的第三个参数为指定的消息队列数。比如`queueNum=4`，那么就会在指定的 broker 中创建 4 个读队列和 4 个写队列，所有的 broker 中针对该主题创建的队列数都是一样的。所以默认情况下，不会出现同一主题下，不同的 broker 具有不同的队列数的问题，因此也不需要在异步发送失败的时候重新设置`queueId`。\r\n\r\n不同broker上的队列数是可以调整的。。。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/598080016/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/598087026","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/1711#issuecomment-598087026","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/1711","id":598087026,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5ODA4NzAyNg==","user":{"login":"hppx5456","id":26714352,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzE0MzUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26714352?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hppx5456","html_url":"https://github.com/hppx5456","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hppx5456/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hppx5456/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hppx5456/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hppx5456/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hppx5456/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hppx5456/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hppx5456/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hppx5456/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hppx5456/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-12T09:23:38Z","updated_at":"2020-03-12T09:23:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"我也遇到了同样的问题，按照你的方法并没有解决","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/598087026/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/598127430","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/754#issuecomment-598127430","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/754","id":598127430,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5ODEyNzQzMA==","user":{"login":"duhenglucky","id":7938968,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5Mzg5Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7938968?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky","html_url":"https://github.com/duhenglucky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-12T11:02:13Z","updated_at":"2020-03-12T11:02:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@yaohuacheng

spring 的 TransactionSynchronizationManager.registerSynchronization，然后在回调内手工提交终态\r\n跟 spring 无关，只是因为项目内用 spring 来管理事务的比较多，但 rocketmq 可以不用考虑这块， 建议是 TransactionMQProducer 新增一个方法 sendHalfMessage，这个方法里面不会去调用 executeLocalTransaction，半消息需手动指定终态，保持原有设计，然后通过把底层的 defaultMQProducerImpl.endTransaction 公开到 TransactionMQProducer 这一层即可。坏处新增了一个 api 方法，事务消息这块多了一个概念，虽然真正使用的时候可以通过封装让业务无感，但对开源的通用中间件，我觉得应该用更好的方案，虽然现在业务中我是这么干的。\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2259289435@qq.com\r\n \r\nFrom: liujian16\r\nDate: 2020-03-12 20:53\r\nTo: apache/rocketmq\r\nCC: 2259289435;

consumer should be equal to msgId of message that proucer sent\r\nWhat did you see instead?\r\nmsgId(producer) equal to unique_key(consumer)\r\nunique key(consumer) equal to offsetMsgId(producer)\r\nPlease tell us about your environment:\r\nOther information (e.g. detailed explanation, logs, related issues, suggestions how to fix, etc):\r\nAfter dig info code, producer deal with sendResult ugly, producer set msgId with self unique key, but set offsetMsgId with msgId of broker result, which caused unconsistent result above. consumer logic is right\r\n—\r\nYou are
