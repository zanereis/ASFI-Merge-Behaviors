However, the scope of the changes turned out to be more extensive than I had originally anticipated. As a result, I'm not entirely confident in the current implementation. I had to create several methods to handle all possible use cases, and there were a couple of scenarios that I couldn't address. I'm looking forward to your feedback to determine if this approach is suitable for our use case.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jspwiki/issues/comments/1754548191/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jspwiki/issues/comments/1755804657","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jspwiki/pull/312#issuecomment-1755804657","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jspwiki/issues/312","id":1755804657,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAJ07c5op3Px","user":{"login":"arturobernalg","id":4700574,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MDA1NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4700574?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg","html_url":"https://github.com/arturobernalg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-10T16:33:24Z","updated_at":"2023-10-10T16:33:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Hi, lgtm!\r\n> \r\n> agree on the ordering of the properties, should be done on a separate PR, probably renaming them according to where they are being used; right now they are ordered (more or less) following JSPs order.\r\n> \r\n> cheers, juan pablo\r\n> \r\n> p.s.: If it helps, we also have a [mini-guide](https://jspwiki-wiki.apache.org/Wiki.jsp?page=HowToI18n) stating the steps needed to locate missing i18n entries and the [translation status](https://jspwiki.apache.org/development/i18n.html) page, which is built with every commit.\r\n\r\nHi @juanpablo-santos \r\n\r\nThank you for the tip.

This happens because of the call to **getParameter**. If (in WikiJSPFIlter) the method is called before the super.doFilter call, the problem occurs. After doFilter, calling it causes no problem. Rewriting the method so it looks at the query string solves the problem:\r\n\r\n```\r\n   static String parsePageFromURL( final HttpServletRequest request, final Charset encoding ) {\r\n        String name = request.getPathInfo();\r\n        if( name == null || name.length() <= 1 ) {\r\n            name = request.getQueryString();\r\n\t\tif (StringUtils.isNotBlank(name) && name.contains(\"page=\"))\r\n\t\t\treturn name.substring(name.indexOf(\"page=\")+5);\r\n\t\telse\r\n\t\t\treturn null;\r\n        } else if( name.charAt(0) == '/' ) {\r\n            return name.substring(1);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        //  This is required, because by default all URLs are handled as Latin1, even if they are really UTF-8.\r\n        // name = TextUtil.urlDecode( name, encoding );\r\n\r\n        return name;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I don't know enough of what is happening here to understand whether that is the right thing to do.

\r\n\r\ncouple of notes,\r\n\r\n* the test-jar issue could be solved just by placing `<skip>false</skip>`just below/inside the [pom generating the test-jar](https://github.com/apache/jspwiki/blob/master/jspwiki-210-test-adaptees/pom.xml#L93). That config defaults to `${maven.test.skip}` and that's why on a clean environment the build fails (the artifact is not built)\r\n    * `-DskipTests` skips test execution, whereas `-Dmaven.test.skip` skips tests execution _and_ compilation, so it's a bit faster. At the deploy stage test had already passed so that flag was added to speed the deploy a bit. Unsure how applying both flags solves the issue on a clean env (no 2.12.3-SNAPSHOT on local repository and `-o` passed to the build)\r\n\r\n* non sonar builds are skipping tests; they shouldn't they help us ensure there are no problems with other JDKs\r\n\r\n* as for switching to jdk-17\r\n    * this would force everyone consuming the snapshot artifacts to forcibly use JDK-17. I'd rather do that at the same time of moving from javax to jakarta, preferably on another PR\r\n    * when we move to jdk-17, as the sonar scanner requires also at least jdk-17, the stage of the jenkinsfile could be simplified by undoing thie [commit](https://github.com/apache/jspwiki/commit/8c0d55e344d3f48ca7747e05fa2306a32b72800c)\r\n\r\ncheers,\r\njuan pablo","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jspwiki/issues/comments/2197482953/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jspwiki/issues/comments/2212564643","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jspwiki/pull/347#issuecomment-2212564643","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jspwiki/issues/347","id":2212564643,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAJ07c6D4Q6j","user":{"login":"dependabot[bot]","id":49699333,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDk2OTkzMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/29110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/dependabot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-07T20:37:46Z","updated_at":"2024-07-07T20:37:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"OK, I won't notify you again about this release, but will get in touch when a new version is available.

Hi,\r\n> \r\n> couple of notes,\r\n> \r\n>     * the test-jar issue could be solved just by placing `<skip>false</skip>`just below/inside the [pom generating the test-jar](https://github.com/apache/jspwiki/blob/master/jspwiki-210-test-adaptees/pom.xml#L93). That config defaults to `${maven.test.skip}` and that's why on a clean environment the build fails (the artifact is not built)\r\n>       \r\n>       * `-DskipTests` skips test execution, whereas `-Dmaven.test.skip` skips tests execution _and_ compilation, so it's a bit faster. At the deploy stage test had already passed so that flag was added to speed the deploy a bit. Unsure how applying both flags solves the issue on a clean env (no 2.12.3-SNAPSHOT on local repository and `-o` passed to the build)\r\n> \r\n>     * non sonar builds are skipping tests; they shouldn't they help us ensure there are no problems with other JDKs\r\n> \r\n>     * as for switching to jdk-17\r\n>       \r\n>       * this would force everyone consuming the snapshot artifacts to forcibly use JDK-17. I'd rather do that at the same time of moving from javax to jakarta, preferably on another PR\r\n>       * when we move to jdk-17, as the sonar scanner requires also at least jdk-17, the stage of the jenkinsfile could be simplified by undoing thie [commit](https://github.com/apache/jspwiki/commit/8c0d55e344d3f48ca7747e05fa2306a32b72800c)\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> cheers, juan pablo\r\n\r\nHi @juanpablo-santos ,\r\n\r\nThanks for your feedback.\r\n\r\n    Test-Jar Issue:\r\n        I added <skip>false</skip> to the maven-jar-plugin configuration in the jspwiki-210-test-adaptee module to ensure the test-jar is always built.\r\n\r\n    Test Execution:\r\n        I will ensure that non-Sonar builds do not skip tests to maintain coverage and catch issues across different JDKs.\r\n\r\n    JDK-17 Integration:\r\n        I agree that switching to JDK-17 and moving from javax to jakarta should be handled in a separate PR to ensure a smooth transition. Once we switch to JDK-17, we can simplify the Jenkinsfile

done with the xmlrpc usage. Given that xmlrpc is not ported to jakarta, perhaps ditching it would be an alternative, providing something equivalent after landing the jakarta branch. A 5 minute google search seems to imply that metaweblog has been superseeded by micropub so that might be an option. Providing a full rest api would be nicer, but I see that unrelated to the move to jakarta, could be tackled afterwards (and given our current pace I wouldn't expect to be delivered shortly)\r\n\r\n@weberjn would you mind looking at the above PR?

I would like to push a few PRs into master and merge them on this new branch before merging, but I'd prefer to go with this first to keep it as manageable as possible.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jspwiki/issues/comments/2525207199/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jspwiki/issues/comments/2525208314","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jspwiki/pull/370#issuecomment-2525208314","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jspwiki/issues/370","id":2525208314,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAJ07c6Wg576","user":{"login":"juanpablo-santos","id":1218530,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTg1MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1218530?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanpablo-santos","html_url":"https://github.com/juanpablo-santos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanpablo-santos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanpablo-santos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanpablo-santos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanpablo-santos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanpablo-santos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanpablo-santos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanpablo-santos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanpablo-santos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanpablo-santos/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-12-07T15:28:26Z","updated_at":"2024-12-07T15:28:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"ouch, opened the jakarta branch, but I've noticed this PR cannot be merged now due to conflicts, @weberjn would you mind looking at that too? and of course, a thousand thanks for all the work that has gone into this PR! :-)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jspwiki/issues/comments/2525208314/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jspwiki/issues/comments/2555894303","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jspwiki/pull/360#issuecomment-2555894303","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jspwiki/issues/360","id":2555894303,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAJ07c6YV9of","user":{"login":"juanpablo-santos","id":1218530,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTg1MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1218530?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanpablo-santos","html_url":"https://github.com/juanpablo-santos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanpablo-santos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanpablo-santos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanpablo-santos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanpablo-santos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanpablo-santos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanpablo-santos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanpablo-santos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanpablo-santos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanpablo-santos/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-12-19T22:37:56Z","updated_at":"2024-12-19T22:37:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @spyhunter99, apologies this got so long to merge, should be part of 2.12.3-git-03 now.
