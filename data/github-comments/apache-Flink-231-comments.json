With Flip-6 this will be the case. See #5444.\r\n\r\nThe underlying assumption to make this work, though, is that a user won't submit a new job with the a job id to a cluster with a cluster id for which ZooKeeper already contains persisted checkpoints from a previous run. So either the cluster id or the job id must be different. \r\n\r\nI think so far, when using the Flink client this should be the case. However, when generating the `JobGraph` yourself and keeping it around to submit it to a standalone cluster, then this assumption will break because both the `JobID` and the cluster id will be the

While we strongly encourage the use of asynchronous snapshots to avoid blocking pipelines, please note that this is a new feature and currently not enabled by default.`, but I found `asynchronous snapshots` is enabled by default, it seems like out of date, could you please also have a look ? @StefanRRichter ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/366224566/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/366224755","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/5490#issuecomment-366224755","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/5490","id":366224755,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NjIyNDc1NQ==","user":{"login":"StefanRRichter","id":2128543,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjg1NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2128543?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter","html_url":"https://github.com/StefanRRichter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-16T12:37:50Z","updated_at":"2018-02-16T12:37:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes, that is outdated.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/366224755/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/366255419","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/5495#issuecomment-366255419","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/5495","id":366255419,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NjI1NTQxOQ==","user":{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-16T14:49:07Z","updated_at":"2018-02-16T14:49:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It's hard to know the actual changes from the existing savepoint it case. I created a new history by tweezing apart the copying and the actual modifications: https://github.com/aljoscha/flink/tree/finish-pr-5495-broadcast-migration-test. I first only copy the existing test to create the new one, then I apply the changes. Could you update your PR to that?\r\n\r\nAnother thing is that in general reusing code is good but in this test you should simply copy all the user code, the new test refers to classes in the old test which will make it hard if we want to remove the old test at some point and also makes things hard with serialisation, as you noticed.
