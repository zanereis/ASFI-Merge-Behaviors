Continous Integration - I would like airflow to integrate with something like travis-ci, circle-ci, gitlab-ci. This would make submitting patches a breeze and I assume it would make reviewing easier as well. I have already done some work on this in my travisci branch in https://github.com/bolkedebruin/airflow, but it is still in the early stages. I am using snakebite's integration testing as an example as they include testing against hadoop and multiple python's.\n2. Now that basic kerberos is in (thanks!), I would like to have integration with a LDAP directory and role based access. I have kerberos and ldap (yes both) web authentication ready (not quite ready for merging yet). A change here I would suggest to airflow is to make the login handler configurable instead of doing this by PYTHON_PATH.\n3. HDFS DAG Storage - No need for syncing directories any more and it helps closing the loop from a security perspective. Arguably this can be quite a task to achieve due to the fact that snakebite does not support python 3 yet and the alternative libhdfs3 has no python integration yet.\n4. YARN executor - No need anymore for a separate cluster just run it in the hadoop eco system. Spark comes to mind how to handle this (maybe). \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/146099828/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/146192437","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/373#issuecomment-146192437","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/373","id":146192437,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NjE5MjQzNw==","user":{"login":"kivismik","id":14199457,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTk5NDU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14199457?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kivismik","html_url":"https://github.com/kivismik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kivismik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kivismik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kivismik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kivismik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kivismik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kivismik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kivismik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kivismik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kivismik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-07T13:13:24Z","updated_at":"2015-10-07T13:13:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks!

So, just as we would set t2 as dependent on t1 by doing `t2.set_upstream(t1)`, we could say t2 should wait for its previous run to finish by setting `t2.set_yesterday_as_upstream(t2)`. Then you get functionality like `wait_for_downstream` for free, eg `t1.set_yesterday_as_upstream(t2)`.  And it would unify the conceptual image between `set_upstream` and `depends_on_past` to both just being arrows.\n\nThere's a common thread here, of taking all the logic that dictates how the DAG is followed, and putting it into the DAG itself. On this thread, it might pay to do the same with `trigger_rule`. Instead of specifying on the task level how to join the upstream tasks, have separate nodes which would be e.g. `or` nodes (where `or` means \"go as soon as one upstream has finished/succeeded\"), or an `is_finished` node. (`and` and `was_success` would be the default so that you don't have to add nodes everywhere).  Then you could do more advanced dependencies like \"Run t3 if t1 successfully completes or if t2 completes at all\"\n\nHere's how these two ideas would look conceptually\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4633429/10346559/df31f9a8-6cfd-11e5-9d9d-ca976b99ca70.png)\n\nNote that you could probably mimic most of the functionality of the `trigger_rule` \"logic\" nodes (all but the `not` node, I believe) by just creating a dummy task and setting the appropriate `trigger_rule` on that task. But that would store its results in the database and appear in all the visualizations, which is probably not desirable. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/146292503/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/146320626","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/492#issuecomment-146320626","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/492","id":146320626,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NjMyMDYyNg==","user":{"login":"artwr","id":1518713,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTg3MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1518713?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr","html_url":"https://github.com/artwr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-07T20:37:56Z","updated_at":"2015-10-07T20:37:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"That's odd, in theory, the code at https://github.com/airbnb/airflow/blob/master/airflow/hooks/S3_hook.py#L140-L152 should get a new token each time.

You can modify settings via a REST api and those are persisted (technically, they are optionally persisted) between restarts of the application.\n\nAbout the configuration file, I guess that makes sense.  I saw [that hook](https://github.com/airbnb/airflow/blob/1.5.1/airflow/settings.py#L69) today when looking at the code and wasn't sure what the recommended use of that is.  Using it to inject more content into the settings django-style makes sense.  Thanks for the tip.\n\nAbout the switch from cfg: I can tell you that a lot of tools out there are moving to yaml, toml, or even json since they are more friendly to edit in other languages than python files.  At my company we just moved a few internal services off of python files for that reason (and also the need to play with the python path to get those formats to work).  I agree that cfg files are not super awesome.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/148860418/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/148869018","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/516#issuecomment-148869018","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/516","id":148869018,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0ODg2OTAxOA==","user":{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-17T00:13:45Z","updated_at":"2015-10-17T00:13:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mistercrunch @artwr I have a reasonable test environment running now (my own branch). \n\nI have used caching for dependencies by using wheels and by storing them in travis cache.
