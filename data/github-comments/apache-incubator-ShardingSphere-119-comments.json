Do you think it is better to prefer the partition volume than listing all endpoints? That is, in this case: instead of `range.partition.split.value=10,20,30,40`, maybe we can consider `partition.volume = 10`. I am not sure, so I'd like to listen to your voice. 😀\r\n\r\n@tristaZero Partition volume looks more concise, but it can only split all values into same interval partition except the first and last partition, this way may not meet the scene of custom partition range.\r\n\r\nUsers use partition volume to split all values, and may encounter some scenarios where the amount of partition data is small. At this time, it may be more desirable to be able to merge multiple partition ranges, that is, custom partition ranges.\r\n\r\nIs it better to provide two Range algorithms? One meets the requirements of flexible scenarios, and the other is more suitable for general scenarios.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/619721301/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/619722582","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/pull/5327#issuecomment-619722582","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/5327","id":619722582,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxOTcyMjU4Mg==","user":{"login":"strongduanmu","id":10829171,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODI5MTcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10829171?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/strongduanmu","html_url":"https://github.com/strongduanmu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strongduanmu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strongduanmu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strongduanmu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strongduanmu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strongduanmu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strongduanmu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strongduanmu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strongduanmu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strongduanmu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-27T05:08:30Z","updated_at":"2020-04-27T05:08:30Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> BTW, instead of `Fixes #5280 .` which makes this issue closed after merging, `Ref #5280` is suggested, as we still welcome any other great ideas. :)\r\n\r\nOkay, I will modify it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/619722582/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/619733569","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/pull/5334#issuecomment-619733569","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/5334","id":619733569,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxOTczMzU2OQ==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-27T05:36:39Z","updated_at":"2020-04-27T05:36:39Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## Pull Request Test Coverage Report for [Build 11276](https://coveralls.io/builds/30358606)\n\n* **0** of **0**   changed or added relevant lines in **0** files are covered.\n* No unchanged relevant lines lost coverage.\n* Overall coverage remained the same at **57.115%**\n\n---\n\n\n\n|  Totals | [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/builds/30358606/badge)](https://coveralls.io/builds/30358606) |\n| :-- | --: |\n| Change from base [Build 11273](https://coveralls.io/builds/30356822): |  0.0% |\n| Covered Lines: | 11857 |\n| Relevant Lines: | 20760 |\n\n---\n##### 💛  -

We can use another way to improve performance by providing a `useCache` parameter. \r\nIf users configured fewer partitions, the performance should be able to meet the requirements. But if the num of partition ranges is very large, such as 100 partitions, users can set `useCache` parameter to `true`, use the cache to improve performance, just like

The code is as below:\r\n\r\n`\r\n<insert id=\"batchInsertOrUpdate\" parameterType=\"xxx.UserTemplateStat\">\r\n        INSERT INTO user_template_stat (\r\n        coupon_template_id,\r\n        user_id,\r\n        channel_code,\r\n        received_count\r\n        )\r\n        VALUES\r\n        <foreach collection=\"userTemplateStats\" item=\"item\" separator=\",\">\r\n            (\r\n            #{item.couponTemplateId,jdbcType=INTEGER},\r\n            #{item.userId,jdbcType=VARCHAR},\r\n            <choose>\r\n                <when test=\"item.channelCode != null\">\r\n                    #{item.channelCode,jdbcType=VARCHAR},\r\n                </when>\r\n                <otherwise>\r\n                    '',\r\n                </otherwise>\r\n            </choose>\r\n            #{item.receivedCount,jdbcType=INTEGER} + #{item.baseCount,jdbcType=INTEGER}\r\n            )\r\n        </foreach>\r\n        ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE\r\n        <trim suffixOverrides=\",\">\r\n            received_count = received_count + VALUES(received_count)\r\n        </trim>\r\n    </insert>\r\n`\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4264938/80463783-60659f00-896b-11ea-8f2c-b93c1d8b21ef.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the sql rewrite, there are 2 parameters(4 parameters before rewrite) and  the parameters for ` #{item.receivedCount,jdbcType=INTEGER} + #{item.baseCount,jdbcType=INTEGER}` are parsed incorrectly.  Here is debug information for InsertValueContext, the CommonExpressonSegment is not a  ParameterMarkerExpressionSegment.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4264938/80462638-92760180-8969-11ea-8692-e65fd59a5d00.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4264938/80464863-fbab4400-896c-11ea-8a38-8b581b623c99.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/620452376/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/620470762","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/pull/5363#issuecomment-620470762","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/5363","id":620470762,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMDQ3MDc2Mg==","user":{"login":"tristaZero","id":27757146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NzU3MTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27757146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero","html_url":"https://github.com/tristaZero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-28T08:49:39Z","updated_at":"2020-04-28T08:49:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi
