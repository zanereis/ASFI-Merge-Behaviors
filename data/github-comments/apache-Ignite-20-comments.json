hi! I've merge your changes related to async thin client API. I leverage on introduced by me `apply*` methods and then remove AtomicInteger you're used for the counter, also I've fix exception issue (when final exception missed if it's different from ClientConnectionException after retry) and add test for that.\r\n\r\nCould you please review my changes again.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/comments/702041555/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/comments/702745018","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ignite/pull/8303#issuecomment-702745018","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/8303","id":702745018,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwMjc0NTAxOA==","user":{"login":"nizhikov","id":880793,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MDc5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/880793?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nizhikov","html_url":"https://github.com/nizhikov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nizhikov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nizhikov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nizhikov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nizhikov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nizhikov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nizhikov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nizhikov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nizhikov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nizhikov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-02T13:49:37Z","updated_at":"2020-10-02T13:49:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hello @tkalkirill Can you, please, take a look at my changes?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/comments/702745018/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/comments/703105523","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ignite/pull/8311#issuecomment-703105523","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/8311","id":703105523,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwMzEwNTUyMw==","user":{"login":"Vladsz83","id":8819010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTkwMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8819010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vladsz83","html_url":"https://github.com/Vladsz83","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vladsz83/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vladsz83/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vladsz83/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vladsz83/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vladsz83/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vladsz83/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vladsz83/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vladsz83/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vladsz83/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-03T13:40:31Z","updated_at":"2020-10-03T13:40:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Wrong branch","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/comments/703105523/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
