One quick remark though.\n1. Even the JSON supported types are not prone to lossiness in multi language settings. They should also be typed.\n2. In a multi language setting, having type names without their java classes is not helpful. \n\nI can illustrate both of these points with the following JSON : `{\"id\":1}`\nThe client assumes `id` is `int` but what exactly is an int? is it `16bit`, `32bit`, or `64bit`? Languages will have their own definition here. Actually some languages will even have different values of `int` depending on how they were compiled. \nChanging it to `{\"id\":[{\"@class\":\"Integer\"}, 1]}` is not helpful in this case either. However the following is explicit and is something you can work with: `{\"id\":[{\"@class\":\"java.lang.Integer\"}, 1]}`. It's immediately identifiable and well documented. The client knows this is a 32bit Int and can work accordingly, the java virtual machine handles this really well, we should take advantage of it. Without this you would have to go through documentation or code to figure out what you were dealing with. \n\nIn conclusion:\n1. Thinking about it some more it's possible that Integer is the only special case that would need typing in the json supported types. I'll give it some more though. We could possibly have a \"verbose\" option for those who require typing of everything.\n2. Type names should refer to the java class. This also seems to make sense when dealing with custom objects.\n\nPS: I would also like to point out that this format `[{\"@class\":\"java.lang.Integer\"}, 1]` can be a pain in systems that do not necessarily order lists. With these systems you need to check that your list has two elements, that one is a map, and that the map contains a `@class` key. Costly operation.\nPerhaps `{\"@class\":\"java.lang.Integer\", \"value\": 1}` is a better option. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/229995343/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/229999360","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/351#issuecomment-229999360","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/351","id":229999360,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyOTk5OTM2MA==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-01T17:08:38Z","updated_at":"2016-07-01T17:08:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I thought that java integer would be implied.

Serializing a Long or a Short will result in an explicit type added. To be very explicit, in JSON everything is Doubles and Longs, it does that because it's the bigger container format that contains the others less precise ones. Jackson however, considers that when an Integer is to be serialized, there is no need for an explicit type because the precision will be kept since for JSON it's in a Long. When it comes to serializing a Long, still no precision loss but the format explicitly indicates to the Deserializer that what has been serialized initially was a Long. So everything is as defined as if the Integer was typed, because by default the reader assumes everything's an Integer, and if not there will be a type to specify what it is. However we have save a large payload size by not typing the integer. Same concept for Float VS Double, for JSON everything is a Double, if a value is a Float, it will be typed, if not, by default it's a Float.\n\nSo as I said in the description I think the outcome of the mail conversation was to not type Simple values. Mostly because we're not sure if this is going to be useful or not. However, adding those types in the future, for Simple values, can be very easily done and I've left detailed comments in the `TypeSerializer` on how to add them when we deem it necessary. Also, adding them would not break existing code since the format would be the same, it's just that _every_ value would follow the format for typed values. Since there's no possibility to mix-up for the Numeric values as explained above with the Shorts and Longs and etc... I still think we should wait somebody explicitly requires it.\n\n> Perhaps {\"@class\":\"java.lang.Integer\", \"value\": 1} is a better option.\n\nAs I see it for how I implemented the TypeDeserializer, it acts as a meta deserializer that will read the raw text JSON sequentially, so there's no chance there can be a mixup in the order, it does not deserialize the whole structure and creates a `List<Map<>>` object. Same for the TypeSerializer, it does not create a Java `List` object to write the type, but it writes directly in JSON \"write a start_array token, write a start_map token, write a property name, write a text field (the type name), write a end_array token, etc\" so same thing, there is no chance there can be a mix up in the order.\nI don't know what it could look like for parsers of other languages, but it would seem like doing something else than that would be quite inefficient in terms of performance because it would mean that for every typed value you would instantiate a `new List<Map<>>` just to read a simple value. Does that makes sense ?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/230008934/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/230011145","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/351#issuecomment-230011145","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/351","id":230011145,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMDAxMTE0NQ==","user":{"login":"b20n","id":141718,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTcxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/141718?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/b20n","html_url":"https://github.com/b20n","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b20n/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b20n/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b20n/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b20n/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b20n/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b20n/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b20n/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b20n/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b20n/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-01T18:02:03Z","updated_at":"2016-07-01T18:02:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> To be very explicit, in JSON everything is Doubles and Longs\n\nAccording to [RFC 7159](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159#section-6), all numerics (i.e., both integral and decimal) in JSON are of a single type, Numeric, with implementation-specific ranges.

I'm not tied to one or the other - \"@type\" does seem a little better to me the more i think on it, but I'll let @newkek (or others) weigh in on it.\n\n> 1. Don't use Java types. Use BSON as a reference. It has a nice type system and solved most if not all of the type concerns. http://bsonspec.org/spec.html\n\nNot sure about BSON typing as a solution. Ultimately we want to know if something is a `Vertex`, `Edge`, `Duration`, `GeoPoint`, etc. In fact we don't always know the types ahead of time (like Titan's `GeoPoint`), so using the java class name is pretty convenient.\n1. If space and processing efficiency is a priority, then consider actually using BSON.\n\nimo, we're pretty deep into this approach having discussed it over multiple weeks in the community. making a big switch like that is probably something to reserve for the future especially since @newkek put a fair bit of effort into this work at this point and it delivers what took a while to get agreement on. \n\nIf however BSON (or some other format) could be proven a more efficient network serialization format that is truly programming language agnostic, with wide support and consistently performant parsers in the major languages we support (which is what had doomed MsgPack some time back), then I think we could consider that as an additional IO format.  @robertdale if you have ideas there, it would be nice to hear them. Please consider sending a message on the dev mailing list if you do.\n1. Alternatively, use an external schema to define types. It could even be appended to and a part of the output.\n\nThat would be an interesting option, however would mostly be good for network serialization and not so much for file storage. So far we haven't written a network only IO package, though we have written a file storage only one with GraphML. I think that we could consider a network serialization one only since dependence on Gremlin Server for non-JVM languages is going to be something we need to support in the face of GLVs.\n\nThanks for your thoughts @robertdale \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/230107018/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/230151393","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/351#issuecomment-230151393","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/351","id":230151393,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMDE1MTM5Mw==","user":{"login":"newkek","id":3471564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NzE1NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3471564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek","html_url":"https://github.com/newkek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-03T12:37:28Z","updated_at":"2016-07-03T12:37:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes the `@class` bothered me a little as well, since now it doesn't really describe a \"Class\".

Hence why I suggested even typing things like Int and using java classes. Honestly depending on how you compiled your PHP your basic JSON int will be converted to `Long`. And that's the case I was highlighting.\nIt makes sense to ignore this if you're trying to reduce de payload but we'll still be lacking on the non-lossiness end. \n\n> As I see it for how I implemented the TypeDeserializer, it acts as a meta deserializer that will read the raw text JSON sequentially, so there's no chance there can be a mixup in the order\n\nYou can't guaranty that the order would be maintained in some languages hence my previous comment. These languages will parse the JSON into `List<Map, ?>` then check the list and Map along the lines of what I said in my previous post. It would be much more efficient to simply have JSON cast to `Map` and run a simple check on keys. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/230500736/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/230516487","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/351#issuecomment-230516487","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/351","id":230516487,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMDUxNjQ4Nw==","user":{"login":"newkek","id":3471564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NzE1NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3471564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek","html_url":"https://github.com/newkek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-05T15:41:26Z","updated_at":"2016-07-05T15:51:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Well, I agree we cannot prevent some parsers and drivers to read the whole JSON content and check the created object for the types only afterward.

I've caught up on the discussion and I'll offer some more food for thought since I haven't seen any other ideas. Embedding metadata is neither easy nor fun (not for me anyway). For any serious integration type work it's always best to have a well-defined schema up-front.\n\nOn types:\n\n> @spmallette\n> In fact we don't always know the types ahead of time (like Titan's GeoPoint), so using the java class name is pretty convenient\n\nConvenience is not the same as using Java types. By \"not using java types\", we mean:\n- not using java package names\n- not using types specific to Java\n- using primitives and other common types that are concise and portable\n- should include domain-specific types. e.g. Vertex, Edge, etc.\n- may include other standards. e.g. GeoJSON\n\nDefining primitives, common types:\n- http://swagger.io/specification/#dataTypeFormat\n- http://bsonspec.org/spec.html\n- http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html\n- http://ubjson.org/type-reference/\n\nSo if your Java implementation conveniently shares the same name as the type, then that's wonderful. But if you are to be truly language-agnostic, then at some point the types must be known ahead of time in order to be consumed. For instance, how can my X parser know how to handle a Titan GeoPoint if it's all dynamic? It can't. It must be able to handle this type ahead of time.  And I can't imagine someone would want to manually read a graphson file to discover all the types that must be handled. Maybe I'm getting out of scope as this goes beyond language and steps into being database agnostic. @newkek, please correct me if I'm wrong,  but it doesn't look like the code does any dynamic serializing. It looks like all types are registered anyway. So I'll argue again if you know your types ahead of time, then you may as well have a schema.\n\nBut let's continue with embedded metadata...\n\nIn JSON, the only unambiguous types are\n- array (unless you want to disambiguate from list which may be very valid)\n- string\n- boolean (true, false)\n- null\n\nTo avoid confusion on all other types, including numbers, they should be typed. Thus they are objects (and not lists of things). The metadata can be at the same level as the object and alleviates these concerns: @newkek \" a List in which the first element is a Map in which the first entry's key\" and @PommeVerte \"can be a pain in systems that do not necessarily order lists\".  Metadata can be differentiated from member fields by a prefix (e.g. '@').  Primitive types (or objects) having only a single value would have a \"value\" key which maps to the actual value.\n\n``` json\n[\n   {\n      \"@type\":\"Vertex\",\n      \"id\":{\n         \"@type\":\"int64\",\n         \"value\":12345\n      },\n      \"label\":\"person\",\n      \"properties\":{\n         \"@type\":\"VertexProperty\",\n         \"skill\":{\n            \"id\":{ \"@type\":\"int64\",\n                    \"value\":8723\n            },\n            \"@type\":\"int32\",\n            \"value\":5\n         },\n         \"secrets\":[\n            { \"id\":{\n                  \"@type\":\"int64\",\n                  \"value\":8723\n               },\n               \"@type\":\"uuid\",\n               \"value\":\"1de7bedf-f9ba-4e94-bde9-f1be28bef239\"\n            },\n            {  \"id\":{\n                  \"@type\":\"int64\",\n                  \"value\":8724\n               },\n               \"@type\":\"uuid\",\n               \"value\":\"34523adf-f9ba-4e94-bde9-f2345bcd3f45\"\n            }\n         ]\n      },\n      \"inE\":[\n         {  \"@type\":\"Edge\",\n            \"label\":\"knows\",\n            \"id\":{\n               \"@type\":\"int64\",\n               \"value\":987234\n            },\n            \"properties\":{  },\n            \"outV\":[  { } ]\n         }\n      ]\n   }\n]\n```\n\nI wouldn't concern myself with the additional payload size for metadata. I wouldn't sacrifice conciseness for size. One could always compress the file if size is a concern. Also, the reader/writer could be easily enhanced to support zip. I would take the pragmatic approach and address it when it's no longer working for people.\n\nAnyway, maybe this is all GraphSON 3.0 stuffs.  HTH.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/231157389/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/231180815","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/335#issuecomment-231180815","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/335","id":231180815,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMTE4MDgxNQ==","user":{"login":"pluradj","id":4974160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NzQxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4974160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj","html_url":"https://github.com/pluradj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-07T19:22:59Z","updated_at":"2016-07-07T19:22:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Just

the format you suggest would lead to the same inconsistencies as in GraphSON 1.0. Since the type is at the same level than the data itself, whether the container is an Array or an Object, the type format would not be the same. I just pushed a change in the format that is the one @PommeVerte suggested, which gives a consistent format, without the concern of unordered Lists (for reference the new format is `{\"@type\" : \"typeName\", \"@value\" : value}`.\n\n> please correct me if I'm wrong, but it doesn't look like the code does any dynamic serializing.\n\nThe `TypeIdResolver` which is the object that the serializers will call to get a TypeID from a java `Object` is dynamic in a way, in the sense that it returns `o.getClass().getSimpleName()`. So there is no `object` -> typeID index reference. However for the Deser, as explained in the description, Java by default doesn't offer a way to get a Class by its simple name, so the `TypeIdResolver` needs to keep a reference index of typeID(which is a class's simple name) -> Java `Class`. Don't know if that answers your question..\n\nAlso, types for serialization are known ahead of time (which may contradict what I just said), it's the Serializers that call the `TypeIdResolver` to put the `Class` in the format GraphSON accepts. \n\nSomething I'd like to mention as well is that for now, values with no Serializers _aren't typed_. For unknown values, the GraphSON mapper calls the `toString` serializer and it will \"toString()\" the object without writing its type. That's another tradeoff due to the fact that Java does not have a mechanism to do 'class simple name' -> Java `Class`. This means that serializing random POJOs will result as them being deserialized as Strings. We could work around that by saying \"for random POJOs without serializers, serialize its type and the toString() value\" which is possible, and during deser, if the type is not recognized Deserialize as String. Hope I was clear in the explanation. Note that GraphSON 1.0 added the type \"java.lang.Object\" for unknown POJOs and didn't know how to deserialize them anyway and deserialized Strings.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/231351653/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/231382018","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/315#issuecomment-231382018","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/315","id":231382018,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMTM4MjAxOA==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-08T14:57:01Z","updated_at":"2016-07-08T14:57:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"All tests pass with `docker/build.sh -t -n -i`\n\nVOTE +1\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/231382018/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/231384593","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/315#issuecomment-231384593","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/315","id":231384593,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMTM4NDU5Mw==","user":{"login":"dkuppitz","id":572377,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjM3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/572377?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz","html_url":"https://github.com/dkuppitz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-08T15:06:34Z","updated_at":"2016-07-08T15:06:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"VOTE: +1\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/231384593/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/231387559","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/315#issuecomment-231387559","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/315","id":231387559,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMTM4NzU1OQ==","user":{"login":"pluradj","id":4974160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NzQxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4974160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj","html_url":"https://github.com/pluradj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-08T15:17:24Z","updated_at":"2016-07-08T15:17:24Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"LGTM.
