For example with HBase, we have...\r\n\r\n- HBase processors (no dependency on hbase-client, dependency on hbase CS api)\r\n- HBase CS API (no dependency on hbase-client)\r\n- HBase CS 1.1.2 impl (dependency on hbase-client 1.1.2)\r\n\r\nSo because the processors and CS API do not know about hbase-client, then we can transparently provide new implementations without changing the processors.\r\n\r\nIn this case we have...\r\n- Pulsar processors (depends on Pulsar client 1.21.0-incubating)\r\n- Pulsar CS API (depends on Pulsar client 1.21.0-incubating)\r\n- Pulsar CS Impls (depends on Pulsar client 1.21.0-incubating)\r\n\r\nI'm not saying the current setup is bad, just mentioning that it won't work out the way the hbase setup works. \r\n\r\nThe trade-off is that in order to achieve the hbase setup you essentially need to recreate parts of their client API and depending how much you have to recreate, it may not be worth it if you are recreating the entire pulsar client API just to shield the processors.\r\n\r\nAlso, something to think about is whether Pulsar's client will work well across different broker versions. For example, when Pulsar 2.x comes out, will the 1.x client work well against a 2.x broker? or vice versa?\r\n\r\nIn Kafka land their client has had issues across versions, like 0.8 client against 0.9 broker did not perform as well as 0.9 client against 0.9 broker, so for this reason you really need to use the corresponding client that goes with the broker.\r\n\r\nIf Pulsar's client doesn't have this problem, maybe we don't need to worry at all about this versioning stuff.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/389879707/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/389915687","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2713#issuecomment-389915687","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2713","id":389915687,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4OTkxNTY4Nw==","user":{"login":"mcgilman","id":123395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzM5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman","html_url":"https://github.com/mcgilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-17T15:51:56Z","updated_at":"2018-05-17T15:51:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Will

I have revisited it and I have some points I'd like to discuss:\r\n\r\n* I rebased against `master`, as there have obviously been some changes there. These fall into a couple places:\r\n  * the version bump to `1.7.0-SNAPSHOT` in the `pom.xml` for both this artifact and a dependency\r\n  * there have been changes to `FlowFileQueue` which `DummyFlowFileQueue` must implement\r\n* I added some logic to `RemoveFlowFilesWithMissingContent` which loads the *master key* from the expected `bootstrap.conf` file in order to handle a `nifi.properties` file with encrypted configuration values. \r\n* The other NiFi Toolkit components have a `*.bat`/`*.sh` script which allows them to be run. This provides a couple features:\r\n  * named command-line arguments as opposed to positional arguments\r\n  * Setting up `$JAVA_HOME` and the classpath rather than calling `java` directly on the command-line\r\n* The `jar-with-dependencies` in `maven-assembly-plugin` only seems to run when you use `mvn clean compile assembly:single` rather than being tied to the `install` phase via a profile (see [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/574650/70465)).
