I'm fairly certain the table charts search is local (ie, it's only searching over the data held in the client). \r\n\r\nSomething this issue highlights is that the filter box runs one query to fetch it's data (with an upper limit) and just runs a local search over that data. A much better design would hit the backend while searching to fetch additional rows lost with the initial limit. This could mean a slow search experience, depending on the cardinality/database conditions, so a an option to enable/disable this behavior would probably make sense.
