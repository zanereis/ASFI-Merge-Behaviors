you help me clarify whether my understanding is right?\n\nThe whole data matrix is of size (num_of_words/batch_size, batch_size). Each column is sentence (marked with `eos` for new sentences).\n\nIn `set_rnn_inputs`, we read a row of data each time because we are doing model parallel. Because ideally, i th row of data represents the i th words of sentences. **This row of words can be fed into an unrolled lstm model**. A mini-batch is of the shape `(seq-len, batch_size)` where `seq_len` is just a proper upper bound of sentence length(a.k.a maximum unrolled lstm length). \n\nIf my understanding is correct, I think I found a little bug here. If you look into function `replicate_data` in `model_parallel_lstm/lstm_ptb.py`,\n\n```\n   def replicate_data(x, batch_size):\n        nbatch = int(x.shape[0] / batch_size)\n        x_cut = x[:nbatch * batch_size]\n        data = x_cut.reshape((nbatch, batch_size), order='F')\n        return data\n```\n\nIt does not take end of sentence into account when slicing data, so the first of each column is probably not the first of a sentence. Besides that, because we are using a mini-batch of the shape `(seq-len, batch_size)`. It is probably better to align sentences in a batch with the start of the batch instead of starting from random position within a sentence. \n\nI think I can fix this by adding padding and some rearrange of data into the code. It will probably reduce the training speed a little bit. But it seems a more correct way to train it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/209673048/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/209674202","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/1828#issuecomment-209674202","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1828","id":209674202,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwOTY3NDIwMg==","user":{"login":"harouwu","id":5057263,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTcyNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5057263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harouwu","html_url":"https://github.com/harouwu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harouwu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harouwu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harouwu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harouwu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harouwu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harouwu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harouwu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harouwu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harouwu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-13T22:28:26Z","updated_at":"2016-04-13T22:28:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"If

First of all, declare the variables in different groups like:\n\n```\nwith mx.AttrScope(ctx_group=\"dev1\"):\n    data = mx.symbol.Variable(\"data\")\n    conv1 = mx.symbol.Convolution(data=data, kernel=(7,7), workspace=workspace,\n                                num_filter=64, name=\"conv1\", pad=(3,3), stride=(2,2))\n\n```\n\nSo data and conv1 will be assigned to \"dev1\". likewise, you can put something with \"dev2\".  Be sure that each layer is associated with a device label. Then when you bind the network, you give group2ctx a dict which could be:\n\n```\nnet.bind(....,\n    group2ctx={'dev1': mx.gpu(0), 'dev2': mx.gpu(1)})\n```\n\nThis is what I did basically. In practice, I found it not that useful as expected because the it was not accelerated. I guess it was because the frequent communication among devices, but I am not completely sure. I hope they could provide more information or tutorial regarding this. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/209836600/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/209867182","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/1818#issuecomment-209867182","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1818","id":209867182,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwOTg2NzE4Mg==","user":{"login":"lisabug","id":5773210,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NzMyMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5773210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lisabug","html_url":"https://github.com/lisabug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lisabug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lisabug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lisabug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lisabug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lisabug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lisabug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lisabug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lisabug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lisabug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-14T10:21:36Z","updated_at":"2016-04-14T10:21:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@tqchen Thanks a lot.

Is there any more efficient way to do this?\n\nHowever, it might have trouble for some image shapes depending on your models. E.g., when `input_shape=(1,3,500,500)`, the above example gets the following error:\n\n```\nMXNetError: InferShape Error in ch_concat_4e_chconcat: [00:36:15] src/operator/./concat-inl.h:152: Check failed: (dshape[j]) == (tmp[j]) Incorrect shape[2]: (1,512,15,15). (first input shape: (1,960,16,16))\n```\n\nOne solution is to reshape the image to a slightly different shape. E.g. `(1,3,512,512)` where `512%32 == 0`. Any better idea?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/209985858/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/210000224","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/1822#issuecomment-210000224","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1822","id":210000224,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMDAwMDIyNA==","user":{"login":"xzqjack","id":13688178,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjg4MTc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13688178?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xzqjack","html_url":"https://github.com/xzqjack","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xzqjack/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xzqjack/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xzqjack/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xzqjack/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xzqjack/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xzqjack/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xzqjack/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xzqjack/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xzqjack/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-14T15:22:07Z","updated_at":"2016-04-14T15:22:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you very much.

I was thinking about it. I tried to add a `rewiring` dict parameter for each module to be added that allow complicated re-mapping of input-output between two chained modules. But it soon become very complicated. I decided to keep it simple like this mainly because I want to avoid implementing a whole imperative computation graph system.\n\nI think we are not advocating everything to be written in imperative way as what Torch does. Instead, main thing should still be in symbolic computation graph, which already had very non-linear \"chaining\". The imperative API is mainly used when one need complicated training logics, and then one can call those `forward`, `update` manually. With this philosophy, the primary goal of `SequentialModule` is actually as an example of how those intermediate level API could be used to operate multiple modules.\n\nIt just happens to be a `BaseModule` subclass (therefore high-level APIs like `fit` can be borrowed directly). It could do some interesting things like data-parallelism + model parallelism at the same time (as @mli mentioned the other day) -- I will add a simple example. But in general I think we might want to avoid it being abused.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/210183666/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/210194253","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/1843#issuecomment-210194253","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1843","id":210194253,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMDE5NDI1Mw==","user":{"login":"piiswrong","id":568948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODk0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong","html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-14T22:58:23Z","updated_at":"2016-04-14T22:58:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@pluskid you don't need to asnumpy() to concatenate.
