Some concerns, though:\n1. As noted before, the fold function in the non-keyed window is not space constant. That is quite a serious issue, if people count heavy streams in large windows. That should be fixed.\n2. The `reduce(...)` code on the `WindowedStream` creates a pass-through window function over Iterable, instead of an pass-through internal window function. The result is that for reduced windows, the single result value is wrapped and unwrapped, instead of simply passed through. That should be a quite simple fix.\n3. Minor comment, more for future code, (and that applies to virtually all Scala API code): The code creates function objects in line a lot. As a result, we have for example at least 10 classes that implement a Flink ReduceFunction and call a Scala Function2. I would suggest to define that class once externally (not inline), because it reduces number of subclasses of the reduce function and that may actually have a positive impact on the JIT friendliness of some programs (if the number of loaded implementations of ReduceFunction at any point becomes reasonably small)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/189459860/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/189460270","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1727#issuecomment-189460270","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1727","id":189460270,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4OTQ2MDI3MA==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-26T20:06:44Z","updated_at":"2016-02-26T20:06:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Okay, will merge this...\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/189460270/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/189462738","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1723#issuecomment-189462738","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1723","id":189462738,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4OTQ2MjczOA==","user":{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-26T20:13:22Z","updated_at":"2016-02-26T20:13:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The `PassThroughFunction` is created because at that point it is not yet clear what type of `InternalWindowFunction` will be created.

can find an alternative version using `ListState` in the following branch:\nhttps://github.com/senorcarbone/flink/tree/ftloopsalt\nSo I noticed that this version is quite **slower** than the one with custom operator state but it can support larger states apparently.\n\nI am (ab)using the PartitionedState to store the ListState in the same key, as @gyfora suggested since it is the only way to obtain the nice representations at the moment. It would be nice to have them available for operator state snapshots as well - @aljoscha have you thought about it? When there is free time (after the release) it would be nice to see what @aljoscha and @StephanEwen think of the two takes as well. No hurries, just take a look when you have time!\n\nThe two annoying issues I noticed during testing and we need to check soon, probably after this PR, are the following:\n- The overhead of transmitting and finally delivering a barrier from the `head` to its consumers increases in time (for each subsequent checkpoint). That is due to having a single queue at the beginning of the iterative part of the job. Events coming from the backedge are pushed further behind the input queue.  It would be nice to pick and deliver events in a round robin fashion among the two input gates (iteration source, regular input). Otherwise, checkpoints in iterative jobs can be really prolonged in time due to this.\n- We need a proper way to deal with deadlocks. I removed the part where we discard events in the tail upon timeout since that boils down to at most once semantics. This PR is not solving deadlocks but I think we should find a graceful way to tackle them.

We want to use our partitioned state abstraction for the window state because that makes it easy to change the state backend depending on the use case. So, when using a ReduceFunction this is actually put into a ReducingState that keeps an aggregated value using that ReduceFunction. Having RichFunctions in inside state would require a lot of overhead. First the function would have to be copied for every different key because the function can keep state internally, second, it would require wiring all the additional RichFunction calls (such as open(), close(), the RuntimeContext) through to the state abstraction.\n\nCould you maybe use the `WindowedStream.apply(ReduceFunction, WindowFunction)` method, this allows you to incrementally aggregate the elements in the window and then get the final result in the WindowFunction once the window is emitted. This WindowFunction can be a RichFunction and can also keep state.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/190649095/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/190650790","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1542#issuecomment-190650790","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1542","id":190650790,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MDY1MDc5MA==","user":{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-01T10:20:25Z","updated_at":"2016-03-01T10:20:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @wenlonglwl,\nyou are right about this.
