Meant to call this out in a comment here or in the code - the \"original\" LocalSolrQueryRequest is technically still accessible on the UpdateCommand seen by individual processors.  So there's still the possibility this object could be messed with by multiple threads.\r\n\r\nThat said - I don't think this is a risk in practice.  I spent a good bit of time tracing through all of the `UpdateCommand.getReq()` invocations, and they're all \"read only\" calls to get either the SolrCore or the IndexSchema relevant to this request.  (Both of which are commonly used across threads.)\r\n\r\nBoth from this and from the problem David described above, it's clear that the UpdateLog replay threading could use a larger rethink, but I'm reluctant to dive into that here.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2416735316/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2417053569","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2766#issuecomment-2417053569","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2766","id":2417053569,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6QEU-B","user":{"login":"gerlowskija","id":9030708,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMzA3MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9030708?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija","html_url":"https://github.com/gerlowskija","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-16T14:44:52Z","updated_at":"2024-10-16T14:44:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Should we have a CHANGES.txt entry mentioning the deprecation?

If `solr.pid.dir` was set, it worked, but the fallback to `{solr.install.dir}/bin` did not work due to a bug, so it fell back to hardcoded `/tmp` which did not work on WIndows. Now it will most likely use `{solr.install.dir}/bin` because it is set in shell script. But anyway we fallback to `java.io.tmpdir`.\r\n\r\nIt still did not work on Windows since I assumed that the PID file on windows was a real PID file. But it isn't. It is a `PORT` file, and its contents is the port number. The `start.cmd` script uses some script magic to list processes and parse PID each time. Don't ask me why.\r\n\r\nSo now we look up process by port if on windows and by pid if on Linux. Tests also updated.

Since this is invoked with a `--solr-url` it could be a remote server. But when combined with `--max-wait-secs` it kind of implies that it is local, so we COULD lookup port from URL and then find the PID from `SolrProcessManager`. The only trouble here is that the list of runing processes in `SolrProcessManager` is ininitalized on startup, so not really able to detect a new process that has suddenly appeared. So there could be a race condition. We could add an `init()` to the SPM of course to poll for new processes. Or we could just accept this difference.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2422347487/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2422402462","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2744#issuecomment-2422402462","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2744","id":2422402462,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6QYu2e","user":{"login":"malliaridis","id":33470669,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDcwNjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33470669?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/malliaridis","html_url":"https://github.com/malliaridis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malliaridis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malliaridis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malliaridis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malliaridis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malliaridis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malliaridis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malliaridis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malliaridis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malliaridis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-18T12:48:42Z","updated_at":"2024-11-12T12:43:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Is this able to backwards ported to 9x?
