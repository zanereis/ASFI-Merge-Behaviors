responding to high-level comments first\r\n* I do think more unification will require Beam 3.0, though maybe we should start brainstorming soon.\r\n\r\n* This PR does not yet add support for Avro dynamic writes. I do have some ideas for how to add dynamic schema support. Essentially a DynamicAvros that extends DynamicDestinations, but adds a method mapping DestinationT -> Schema (with side-input access). The Avro schema today happens entirely in AvroWriter, so this doesn't require anything in FBS or WriteFiles. However, I wonder if this belongs in a separate PR.\r\n\r\n* I don't think all data is grouped by key. AFAICT this is only true if an explicit num shards was selected, in which case it was true before. In the regular path, I believe we only GBK in the spilling case.\r\n\r\n* Ack.
