Your hunch is right, we _don't_ want to create new temp dirs on each call to getBasePersistDirectory. The other tricky thing about this is that sometimes, things call getBasePersistDirectory even if they don't actually need to make a base persist directory.\r\n\r\nOne example where this happens is that KafkaTuningConfig gets defaults by doing `RealtimeTuningConfig.makeDefaultTuningConfig(basePersistDirectory)` and then calling get on the various methods, including getBasePersistDirectory. But it doesn't actually want to create the directory at that point. It might never create the directory, especially if withBasePersistDirectory is called to give it a new directory.\r\n\r\nSo what we want for #3347 is a scheme that allows the things that actually write to getBasePersistDirectory to get the behavior they need (if they call it multiple times, they should get the same response) but for things that _don't_ write to getBasePersistDirectory to avoid triggering needless directory creations.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/269070984/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/269071005","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/3805#issuecomment-269071005","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3805","id":269071005,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2OTA3MTAwNQ==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-24T06:05:53Z","updated_at":"2016-12-24T06:05:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Please

This is bad because those classes will get loaded by all of Druid instead of the Jackson classes we actually want. Calcite master (not yet released) depends on avatica-core-1.9.0, which does not include Jackson classes, so it shouldn't have this problem. But it hasn't been released yet.\r\n\r\nSo some possible solutions:\r\n\r\n1. Include avatica-1.8.0 in the assembly but remove the Jackson classes. Maybe it's possible to do this with some fancy Maven footwork (something involving `maven-dependency-plugin:unpack` in the distribution module)?\r\n2. Create our own version of avatica as @joshelser suggests (I guess this means druid-avatica).\r\n3. Wait for Calcite 1.11.0 to be released, this appears imminent and likely will be before the next Druid release (https://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/calcite-dev/201612.mbox/%3C95CFECE3-A2A7-45D3-9A25-34A091EEA23C%40apache.org%3E).\r\n4. Excluding avatica-1.8.0 and upgrading to avatica-core-1.9.0 doesn't work, since Calcite 1.10.0 won't run properly against avatica-core-1.9.0 due to some method signature changes.\r\n\r\nI'm leaning towards (3) since that looks simplest, but if time is critical, I would be okay with (1) or (2) as well. (1) and (2) are both hacky but (1) seems better and less hacky to me.\r\n\r\n@praveev what are your thoughts?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/270007262/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/270007494","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/3805#issuecomment-270007494","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3805","id":270007494,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MDAwNzQ5NA==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-02T18:46:52Z","updated_at":"2017-01-02T18:46:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@joshelser, thanks for the suggestion.

Do they start over from the beginning or do they save state somewhere and resume where they left off? If they start from the beginning, this may involve a lot of extra work being done if tasks get preempted frequently. If they resume where they left off, we need somewhere to put their state (the contents of the processing buffer and the continuation of the processing thread) as well as some way to avoid saving too much state and running out of resources.\r\n- Do we still have a limit on the max number of concurrent queries, which is currently given by `druid.server.http.numThreads` for most queries and `min(druid.server.http.numThreads, druid.processing.numMergeBuffers)` for groupBy v2? The max number of concurrent queries (_including_ preempted queries) needs to be limited because we don't have an infinite amount of space to store partially merged results.\r\n\r\nHaving separate thread pools (and memory pools and concurrent query limits) per priority level is one way of solving those problems.

You could keep them allocated to the low-priority query, which implies you'll need to reserve some resources ahead of time for high-priority queries, otherwise there might be none left. Or you could deallocate them, which implies that low-priority queries will either get canceled or will need to re-do some or all of their work. Or you could save them to disk and restore them later, which works for the memory pools, but then you have to have a plan for what to do when you run out of disk space.\r\n\r\nIMO, the simplest solution varies based on whether low or high priority queries are \"normal\".\r\n\r\nIf high priority queries are normal but there are a few low priority queries from time to time, then probably reserving resources for high priority queries works best: let high priority queries use _all_ memory but low priority queries only use X% of it. This means low priority queries can't use the full power of the cluster, but that's fine because most of your queries are high priority anyway.\r\n\r\nIf low priority queries are normal but there are a few high priority queries from time to time, I think de-allocating resources works best: if a high priority query comes in, let it grab resources that are currently used by a low priority query, and force that low priority query to start over when the high priority query is done. This means that some low priority queries will need to redo some work, but that's fine because there aren't that many high priority queries so this won't happen very often.\r\n\r\nIf you have a lot of both kinds of queries, that's tougher :)\r\n\r\nSome other thoughts:\r\n\r\n- If the expected workload involves a lot of concurrent low priority queries, you may need to tackle the query concurrency limit too, which is imposed by the jetty thread pool size: `druid.server.http.numThreads`. If those are all taken up by low priority queries, then processing pool QoS is irrelevant since the query will not even get that far. Keeping in mind that lifting this limit will create more memory pressure in terms of memory used for merging results.\r\n- The problem is a lot simpler if you assume that memory for merging results is effectively \"unlimited\". Then you only have to worry about one of those three pools (the processing buffers). This is probably a valid assumption for timeseries. It may even be valid for topN if you have some reasonable limit on the number of concurrent queries and on thresholds.

on your test `testRecursivelyNestedGroupby`, that didn't work because it needs more merge buffers than the test allows, and since the merge buffer pool is blocking, the test blocks forever. I pushed a commit that adds your test, bumps up the test merge buffer pool to 3, adds a maxQueryCount config, and adds docs warning users about this potential deadlock in prod.\r\n\r\nThe new doc blurb is:\r\n\r\n> Note that groupBys require a separate merge buffer on the broker for each layer beyond the first layer of the groupBy. With the v2 groupBy strategy, this can potentially lead to deadlocks for groupBys nested beyond two layers, since the merge buffers are limited in number and are acquired one-by-one and not as a complete set. At this time we recommend that you avoid deeply-nested groupBys with the v2 strategy. Doubly-nested groupBys (groupBy -> groupBy -> table) are safe and do not suffer from this issue. If you like, you can forbid deeper nesting by setting `druid.sql.planner.maxQueryCount = 2`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/270455176/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/270508597","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/3806#issuecomment-270508597","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3806","id":270508597,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MDUwODU5Nw==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-04T22:42:08Z","updated_at":"2017-01-04T22:42:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jihoonson, I just pushed commits for the rest of your comments, please let me know what you think. thanks for the review.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/270508597/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/270509327","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/3800#issuecomment-270509327","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3800","id":270509327,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MDUwOTMyNw==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-04T22:45:34Z","updated_at":"2017-01-04T22:45:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"thanks @joshelser, I'll try that out.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/270509327/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/270511291","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/3800#issuecomment-270511291","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3800","id":270511291,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MDUxMTI5MQ==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-04T22:55:02Z","updated_at":"2017-01-04T22:55:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@joshelser - that build looks good to me.
