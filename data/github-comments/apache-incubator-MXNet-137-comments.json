So what you are suggesting is to do:\r\n\r\n```R\r\ncus_iter <-setRefClass(\"Custom.Iter\", fields = c(\"data\", \"label\",\"batch.size\", \"shuffle\"))\r\ncus_iter$methods(iter.next = function() {\r\n#code here\r\n})\r\ncus_iter$methods(value = function() {\r\n#code here\r\n})\r\n```\r\nCould this class be used as an input to `mx.model.FeedForward.create`?\r\n\r\nIdeally what I would like is to inhereit from a `MXArrayDataIter` and reimplement only the method `value`. If I create an instance of `mx.io.arrayiter`, it has everything that I want but I don't know how to modify the `value`.\r\n```R\r\narray.iter.mx <- mx.io.arrayiter(data = train.x, label = train.y, batch.size = 100, shuffle = TRUE)\r\nis(array.iter.mx)\r\n[1] \"Rcpp_MXArrayDataIter\" \"C++Object\"           \r\n[3] \"envRefClass\"          \".environment\"        \r\n[5] \"refClass\"             \"environment\"         \r\n[7] \"refObject\"\r\nmxnet:::is.MXDataIter(array.iter.mx)\r\n[1] TRUE\r\n```\r\nIn python you can create a custom iterator if you inhereit from `mx.io.DataIter` and reimplement  `provide_data(), provide_label(), next()`. How can this be done in R? \r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/265763496/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/265774674","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/4105#issuecomment-265774674","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/4105","id":265774674,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NTc3NDY3NA==","user":{"login":"thirdwing","id":1547093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDcwOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1547093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing","html_url":"https://github.com/thirdwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-08T15:53:18Z","updated_at":"2016-12-08T15:53:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think you can try something like below:\r\n\r\n```r\r\n> setRefClass(\"Custom.Iter\", contains = \"Rcpp_MXArrayDataIter\")\r\n> \r\n> cus_iter <-setRefClass(\"Custom.Iter\", contains = \"Rcpp_MXArrayDataIter\")\r\n> cus_iter$methods(`iter.next` = function() {return(TRUE)})\r\n> \r\n> cus_iter\r\nGenerator for class \"Custom.Iter\":\r\n\r\nNo fields defined\r\n\r\nClass Methods: \r\n     \"iter.next#Rcpp_MXArrayDataIter\", \"import\", \".objectParent\", \r\n     \"usingMethods\", \"show\", \"getClass\", \"untrace\", \"export\", \".objectPackage\", \r\n     \"callSuper\", \"copy\", \"initFields\", \"getRefClass\", \"trace\", \"field\", \r\n     \"iter.next\", \"num.pad\", \"reset\", \"value\", \"finalize\", \"initialize\"\r\n\r\nReference Superclasses: \r\n     \"Rcpp_MXArrayDataIter\", \"envRefClass\"\r\n\r\n> \r\n> it <- cus_iter$new()\r\n> \r\n> it$iter.next()\r\n[1] TRUE\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/265774674/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/265777680","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/4105#issuecomment-265777680","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/4105","id":265777680,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NTc3NzY4MA==","user":{"login":"miguelgfierro","id":3491412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTE0MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3491412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelgfierro","html_url":"https://github.com/miguelgfierro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelgfierro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelgfierro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelgfierro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelgfierro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelgfierro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelgfierro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelgfierro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelgfierro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelgfierro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-08T16:04:04Z","updated_at":"2016-12-08T16:04:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The problem with that is that it's not taking the methods from the c++ class.

Yes I will start checking in (whatever I have), but all the changes as of now are in Keras branch. I will point to it in here once I checkin(by Monday). As and when I need changes to the MXNET I will create a separate issue and summarize it here. Also appreciate pointing out to use NNVM branch, I was using the master branch till now. I will check out the new symbol in NNVM branch.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/266115998/reactions","total_count":11,"+1":11,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/266117860","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/4162#issuecomment-266117860","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/4162","id":266117860,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NjExNzg2MA==","user":{"login":"shivarajugowda","id":6300651,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMDA2NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6300651?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivarajugowda","html_url":"https://github.com/shivarajugowda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivarajugowda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivarajugowda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivarajugowda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivarajugowda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivarajugowda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivarajugowda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivarajugowda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivarajugowda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivarajugowda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-09T20:41:54Z","updated_at":"2016-12-09T20:41:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@piiswrong let me come up with the exact code and functions I need.
