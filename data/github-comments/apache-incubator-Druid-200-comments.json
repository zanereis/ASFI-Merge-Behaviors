Unfortunately, indeed Oak is not yet connected to be tested end-to-end (in a real scenario). The integration of an off-heap index (specially when also keys are off-heap) requires some baby steps in order to make it efficiently. So we are moving inside-out checking how the oak off-heap index can be used and introducing some Druid changes so the usage is (at least) more or less efficient. As off-heap index (buffer based) and on-heap index (object based) should be used differently.\r\n\r\nHowever, we clearly understand the need and the urgency to allow the real usage of Oak so we hope to make it work soon. In a meanwhile, as this Pool Request is going bigger and bigger we would like to hear your comments about the code so far.\r\n\r\nThanking all reviewers in advance!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/417911674/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/417986752","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/6235#issuecomment-417986752","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6235","id":417986752,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNzk4Njc1Mg==","user":{"login":"KenjiTakahashi","id":431488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTQ4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/431488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KenjiTakahashi","html_url":"https://github.com/KenjiTakahashi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KenjiTakahashi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KenjiTakahashi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KenjiTakahashi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KenjiTakahashi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KenjiTakahashi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KenjiTakahashi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KenjiTakahashi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KenjiTakahashi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KenjiTakahashi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-03T02:52:05Z","updated_at":"2018-09-03T02:52:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@sanastas Thanks for the explanations.

 In my current design, if `druid.indexer.runner.ports` has been specified and non-empty, ports for one peon process will be chosen from these ports rather than using `druid.indexer.runner.startPort` to allocate ports. So if one user specified `druid.indexer.runner.ports` and `druid.indexer.runner.startPort` at the same time, only property `druid.indexer.runner.ports` will be used. \r\n\r\nThen, if add a `druid.indexer.runner.endPort` property, when one user specified these three properties at the same time, what should be done? I think we should make it clear. IMO, we can add a extra `druid.indexer.runner.portStrategy` property to specify port allocation strategy, whose value can be `range|list|startPort` .","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/418475304/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/418488611","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/6263#issuecomment-418488611","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6263","id":418488611,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxODQ4ODYxMQ==","user":{"login":"himanshug","id":246308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjMwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug","html_url":"https://github.com/himanshug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-04T19:26:38Z","updated_at":"2018-09-04T19:27:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@QiuMM \r\n1) if `druid.indexer.runner.ports` is provided then only that is used. `start/endPort` are completely ignored.\r\n2) else, start with `startPort` and end at `endPort` , default value of `endPort` would be (-1 or some special value) that would mean infinity.\r\n\r\nand we put this precedence information in the documentation so that users know what would happen when all 3 are specified.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/418488611/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/418505202","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/6223#issuecomment-418505202","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6223","id":418505202,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxODUwNTIwMg==","user":{"login":"himanshug","id":246308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjMwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug","html_url":"https://github.com/himanshug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-04T20:22:48Z","updated_at":"2018-09-04T20:22:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@gianm @clintropolis alright, so I have added a new method in `ColumnCapability` .
