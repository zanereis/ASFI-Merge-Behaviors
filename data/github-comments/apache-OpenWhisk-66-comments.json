Every multiple of 128MB up to 2GB would be 16 sizes so up to 16 VMs could get wasted in the sense that there could be a VM running just a single 1920MB and other jobs cannot make it there.   The other issue with segregating is that you need to rebalance and dynamically update the invoker flavor and of course this means scheduling to shrink the number of machines as the system detects that a particular size is becoming overprovisioned.  Because of these effects, there is a desire to limit the number of sizes somewhat, a typical sizing (a la free lists) would often be something a little graduated like 128, 256, 384, 512, 768, 1024,
