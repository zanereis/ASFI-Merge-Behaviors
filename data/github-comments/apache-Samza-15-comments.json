Follower(P1) receives the JobModelVersion change notification from server S1 in ensemble which had the majority quorum write.\r\n2. Before Follower(P1) reads the JobModel, it receives a disconnect from zookeeper server S1 and successfully reconnects to zookeeper server S2. \r\n3. On re-connection, the follower(P1) will re-create all the data-node and child-node watches. \r\n4. If the watch is created by P1 after the JobModel version change write propogration had happened to zookeeper-server S2 and the JobModel write, then the notification will not be propogated to the follower.\r\n\r\nSo logging alone wouldn't solve the problem. \r\n\r\nI preferred the retry since it can happen for all zk-writes.
