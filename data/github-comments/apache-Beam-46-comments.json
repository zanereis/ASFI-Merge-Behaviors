I played with this a fair bit and was able to almost get the tests passing. I've attached the diff, which is not quite complete.\n\nA few things to notice\n- Generally, we should try to avoid `getReturnType` -- which returns `Class<?>` in favor of `getGenericReturnType` -- which returns a Java `Type`. This will give us the new type information. However, it will indeed require some potentially more invasive changes in the code. \n- While you can compare `Class<?> == Class<?>`, because they're Java primitives, that's probably not appropriate for `Type` objects. Instead we should use `Type.equals(Type)`.\n- In general, the classes that extract properties should use the `iface` not the `klass` -- that will preserve the generic types.\n- Minor changes to populate the list of already-present functions. Since we're no longer inspecting a class, we can drop the default `equals`, `hashCode`, and `toString`.\n\nHere is what I think is left.\n- [ ] we now have much better type info available -- we should leverage this to do better deduplication. E.g., if I have two different interfaces, one of which declares `List<Integer> getList();` and another of which declares `List<Long> getList()` we should be able to detect this now and throw an error.\n  \n  I think before we did not have this support, but I may be wrong. A unit test should be able to clarify.\n- [ ] As Luke pointed out, there are some places we can likely simplify the conversion code because we can give Jackson better type info.\n- [ ] In general, would like to see unit tests fleshing out the new type checks we can do. E.g., users could make collections like `Map`s before using Jackson's ability to parse JSON in a single argument. I believe in practice this was only used for `Map<String, String>` or maybe `Map<JSON primitive, JSON primitive>` We should add tests to check that we can do more interesting stuff now.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/248935378/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/248935489","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/852#issuecomment-248935489","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/852","id":248935489,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0ODkzNTQ4OQ==","user":{"login":"dhalperi","id":526415,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNjQxNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/526415?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi","html_url":"https://github.com/dhalperi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-22T15:20:48Z","updated_at":"2016-09-22T15:20:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The
