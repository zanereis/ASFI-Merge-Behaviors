\r\n\r\nthe main problem of this is : if we are serializing POJO into avro formats, it should be respecting to how AVRO generates schema for POJOs. Otherwise, if you are migrating other AVRO data from other data sources to Pulsar, or from Pulsar to other data destinations, it will raise schema incompatibility issue. Because Pulsar schema generated schema always allow null, while the schema generated by other systems don't allow null, even they are generated from same POJO. \r\n\r\nAVRO is a pretty standard data format. If pulsar is using AVRO schema, we should respect to its rules, otherwise it is impossible for pulsar to be used for exchanging AVRO data.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/469215115/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/469229690","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/3744#issuecomment-469229690","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/3744","id":469229690,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2OTIyOTY5MA==","user":{"login":"skyrocknroll","id":426290,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNjI5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/426290?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyrocknroll","html_url":"https://github.com/skyrocknroll","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyrocknroll/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyrocknroll/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyrocknroll/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyrocknroll/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyrocknroll/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyrocknroll/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyrocknroll/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyrocknroll/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyrocknroll/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-04T12:07:16Z","updated_at":"2019-03-04T12:07:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"run java8 tests","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/469229690/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/469249106","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/3743#issuecomment-469249106","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/3743","id":469249106,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2OTI0OTEwNg==","user":{"login":"lovelle","id":7503370,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MDMzNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7503370?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovelle","html_url":"https://github.com/lovelle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovelle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovelle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovelle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovelle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovelle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovelle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovelle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovelle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovelle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-04T13:15:56Z","updated_at":"2019-03-04T13:15:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jiazhai @sijie Oh sorry!

@sijie I don't think the current API is the problem, I think we just need to separate API to specify a custom schema.  We currently only allow users to derive a schema from a Java class using the Avro library.  This generates an Avro schema that matches the semantics of java i.e. classes can be null and primitives are not.  However, if I have my own custom avro schema, I can arbitrarily set one class to be nullable while the another class is not.  There is not way for Avro to know that information from just a java class definition.  Even by allowing users to set the flag \"allowNull\" will not cover all cases as user can arbitrarily create avro schemas will null or not null fields.  I think we can do the following: \r\n\r\n1. Use  Avro java annotation to massage your java class to have the schema you desire\r\n2. Have an API for users to specify the schema they want.

of the `allowNull=true/false` question, I think: \r\n 1. This seems to be a problem only with Avro generated code, in which there was a schema defined and we're extracting the wrong schema from the generated POJO\r\n 2. This shouldn't be an issue when one defines an ad-hoc POJO (without starting from Avro schema), because annotations can be used to request nullable/non-nullable.\r\n\r\nThe easiest solution would be to detect that a POJO is generated by Avro and use the `getClassSchema()` instead of doing the reflection based

I don't understand why you say we are not respecting the rules of AVRO\r\n> The only flag that could be settable is the allow null flag that gets set in Pulsar's Avro schema. We can expose that flag to users.\r\n\r\n@jerrypeng \r\n\r\nThat is the problem I am reporting this in the issue. Because Pulsar Avro Schema always set AllowNull and pulsar's users don't have the ability to bypass the AllowNull. My point here is Pulsar AVRO should not try to attach AllowNull.\r\n\r\n> If people want null to all the fields then they can add it at the avro schema.\r\n\r\n@skyrocknroll exactly.\r\n\r\n> I don't think the current API is the problem, I think we just need to separate API to specify a custom schema. \r\n\r\nJerry, that's a different feature. \r\n\r\nThe point here for a given POJO, Pulsar should maintain a basic contract: the schema generated by Pulsar AVRO should be same/compatible with what other tools generated. Pulsar AVRO should not automatically attach AllowNull for all fields, otherwise we shouldn't call it AVRO schema, we should be calling it AlwaysAllowNullAvroSchema.\r\n\r\n> This seems to be a problem only with Avro generated code, in which there was a schema defined and we're extracting the wrong schema from the generated POJO\r\n> This shouldn't be an issue when one defines an ad-hoc POJO (without starting from Avro schema), because annotations can be used to request nullable/non-nullable.\r\n\r\n@merlimat : that's not the *only* case. People can use ReflectData to generate a schema and write events in a different system (let's call it source). when people migrate data from source to pulsar, people use same POJO, these two schemas are not compatible, which will result in events are not able to be written to pulsar.\r\n\r\n> The easiest solution would be to detect that a POJO is generated by Avro and use the getClassSchema() instead of doing the reflection based approach.\r\n\r\nThat's a very limited solution to cover only one use case. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn summary, the questions is about \"shall Pulsar automatically attach AllowNull to POJO generated schema\". Attaching AllowNull changes the default behavior of how AVRO generates POJO and makes Pulsar inconsistent with how other systems use AVRO.\r\n\r\nIf the team decides that AllowNull should be the default behavior in AvroSchema, it should be well documented and highlighted to all avro schema users. and a separate AvroSchema or a flag to disable AllowNull should also be provided for users to not use AllowNull.\r\n\r\nI don't think detecting if it is an Avro generated POJO is the right approach. We should just remove (or provide the ability to) AllowNull when constructing AvroSchema.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/469483661/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/469484274","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/3741#issuecomment-469484274","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/3741","id":469484274,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2OTQ4NDI3NA==","user":{"login":"merlimat","id":62500,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat","html_url":"https://github.com/merlimat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-05T00:31:29Z","updated_at":"2019-03-05T00:31:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> that's not the only case.

If you want to provide a custom schema, we should have the way to do so.  These issues are connected.\r\n\r\nLike I mentioned before, a user can create a Avro schema file with arbitrary fields set to null.  There is no way to get such information from a java class along.  Thus, the api currently does not suffice for general use cases when users are bring in generic avro schemas irregardless of whether allowNull is set by default.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, we can NOT set allowNull by default but it hardly solves the underlying issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/469488859/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/469497781","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/3693#issuecomment-469497781","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/3693","id":469497781,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2OTQ5Nzc4MQ==","user":{"login":"cckellogg","id":240473,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDQ3Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/240473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cckellogg","html_url":"https://github.com/cckellogg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cckellogg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cckellogg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cckellogg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cckellogg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cckellogg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cckellogg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cckellogg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cckellogg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cckellogg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-05T01:31:13Z","updated_at":"2019-03-05T01:31:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"rerun

Given a POJO generated by Avro, there is no way to determine whether this POJO was generated with a schema that allowed or not for null types.\r\n> but that's separate from the point that that alone won't guarantee we can generate the correct schema starting from the generated POJO.\r\n\r\n@merlimat \r\n\r\nThe issue I am creating here is for `AllowNull`. We found `AllowNull` is a problem from 2 use cases: 1) the one reported by @skyrocknroll  2) the other use case that @codelipenghui hit.  \r\n\r\nThe whole picture of @skyrocknroll 's problem is  avro file => avro generated pojo. a schema generated by avro file is not compatible by schema generated by pulsar.AvroSchema(generated pojo). One of the problems is `AllowNull` completely changes the schema definitions. Whether removing `AllowNull` can address this problem or not is a separate issue to be addressed. Although I would expect Avro can handle this well. We shouldn't couple the discussion of this issue with a broad issue introduced by `AllowNull`. \r\n\r\n> It's a 100% correct solution for that case. I don't see what's limited about that.\r\n\r\n@merlimat \r\n\r\nGenerated POJO is the use case reported and discussed at slack channel. If you just handle generated POJO by using `getClassSchema`, you are not covering many other data sources which generate AVRO schema using ReflectData.\r\n\r\n> the contract you are creating when generating an avro schema using the ReflectData api is with the java class itself not some other tool or system. \r\n\r\n@jerrypeng \r\n\r\nI am not creating any contract. They are from real use cases. Also the whole discussion is around POJO only, it is not even a cross-language issue or any user customized schema issue. (it was found when being used in cross-language)\r\n\r\n1) if a user uses an AVRO schema file to generate a schema using avro tools (that's call this schema A), and generate a POJO class. then the user use the POJO class and use pulsar avro schema to generate another schema B. Ideally A and B should be compatible.\r\n\r\n```\r\nschema A => generated pojo => (pulsar AvroSchema) => schema B\r\n\r\n                       ||\r\n                       \\/\r\n\r\nschema A => generated pojo => ReflectData.AllowNull.parse => schema B\r\n```\r\n\r\n`AllowNull` is the problem to prevent them being compatible. I don't know if removing `AllowNull` can fully address this problem or not. That's a specific issue to address for Avro generated POJO. I hope Avro provides the right tools to convert back-and-forth between schema and pojos, otherwise IMO it is a problem of Avro.\r\n\r\nIf we removed `AllowNull`, the flow will be changed to following. The scope of the problem is different - whether `ReflectData` is the right tool to handle Avro generated POJO or does Avro even provide tools to guarantee such conversations.\r\n\r\n```\r\nschema A => generated pojo => ReflectData.parse => schema B\r\n```\r\n\r\n2)  Image I have a data system A (e.g. Spark or Flink) and Pulsar. I have a POJO class (e.g. UserProfile) defined across the whole organization. The schema generated in different systems are completely not compatible even they are using same POJO. When data is flowing between pulsar and other systems, the data might not be processed properly due to incompatible schema. Pulsar is the message bus for exchanging data between other system. If it produces an incompatible schema than other systems, IMO that's a very serious bug.

work to complete in that piece before we can claim we are ready to take such \"incompatible\" migration.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/469542217/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/469543016","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/3741#issuecomment-469543016","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/3741","id":469543016,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2OTU0MzAxNg==","user":{"login":"jerrypeng","id":3613359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTMzNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3613359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng","html_url":"https://github.com/jerrypeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-05T05:25:29Z","updated_at":"2019-03-05T05:25:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Here
