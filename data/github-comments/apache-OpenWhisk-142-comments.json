Thanks a lot for addressing it.\r\nBut the Loadbalancing in the controller has to be adapted as well.\r\nYou need to make a change in the `ShardingContainerPoolBalancer`. Otherwise, the laodbalancer will think, that each invoker has the space for the default vaule of user-memory. That would mean, that an invoker will idle if it has more space or it will be overloaded by the loadbalancer if it has less space.\r\n\r\nOne minor thing: Can we keep the name `user_memory` instead of `use_memory`, as this variable describes how much space will be used for user-actions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/419806409/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/419912527","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/3579#issuecomment-419912527","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/3579","id":419912527,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxOTkxMjUyNw==","user":{"login":"Himavanth","id":3353114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNTMxMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3353114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Himavanth","html_url":"https://github.com/Himavanth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Himavanth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Himavanth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Himavanth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Himavanth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Himavanth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Himavanth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Himavanth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Himavanth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Himavanth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-10T13:30:39Z","updated_at":"2018-09-10T13:30:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Tracking

Application errors and action developer errors are represented in the same ambiguous way: a json dictionary with a single error field. The conductor action therefore cannot propagate the precise status. The \"conductor.js\" code used here (https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/blob/master/tests/dat/actions/conductor.js#L9) unconditionally reports an \"application error\" in all cases. Alternatively, the code `if (args.error) throw args.error` would unconditionally produce an \"action developer error\".\r\n\r\nI am thinking of introducing support for \"raw\" conductor actions, where the full response would be made available to the conductor action, but the code for this does not exist yet.\r\n\r\nIn the documentation, \"invocation failure\" is intended to mean an internal error at invocation time, not an unsuccessful invocation with eg an \"action developer error\".

Then r2to2d tries to update the trigger on C1. Here it finds the entry in cache and hence tries to update using rev r1 and end up in conflict\r\n4. So due to conflict the trigger gets linked to only one action. Here the test case should have failed for conflict but it moved on ...\r\n5. When this trigger gets evaluated then as only one action is configured it leads to test failure.\r\n\r\nAs our regular test on travis only run with 1 Controller and 1 Invoker this failure is not seen.\r\n\r\n### Testcase not failing on conflict\r\n\r\nIt probably happens because `WskRestOperations` uses the `SwaggerValidator` to validate expected response for each HTTP call made. This validation checks against expected response code from swagger defn which in this case do list 409 as expected response. And hence test flow misses to detect that it should have failed at that point.\r\n\r\nProbably here test should check if all prior operation result in 202 or 200\r\n\r\n### Why intermittent failure\r\n\r\nMay be in success case the cache entry gets invalidated before second trigger update happens or request land on same node\r\n\r\nIs above understanding correct?

a more detailed example, use a counter in zk:\r\n- invokera start, counter is 0\r\n- invokera increments the counter (0->1)\r\n- invokera id is 0\r\n- invokerb start, counter is 1\r\n- invokerb increments the counter (1->2)\r\n- invokerb id is 1\r\n...\r\nThe later one, we want to restart invokerb:\r\n- invokerb stop\r\n- invokerb decrements the counter (2 -> 1)\r\n- invokerb start, counter is 1\r\n- invokerb increments the counter\r\n- invokerb id is 1\r\n\r\nNow b has restarted, and is again id=1, but no name is used to associate this id.\r\n\r\nThe ramifications are:\r\n* during restart, a stop must be processed before restarting \r\n* during restart, if multiple instances are restarting, the id previously used may end up on a different host after restart is complete\r\n* during a hard crash, the counter must be manually adjusted\r\n\r\nThe last point is problematic, but may be solvable with a more complicated approach that checks cluster status (for kube/mesos) to determine cases where counter grows > number of instances, etc. \r\n\r\nAlternatively, if we can avoid invokers being tracked as int, we can more easily use some other id, so this may be a temporary solution.

On Kubernetes we have both StatefulSet and DaemonSet to give us logical names. \r\n\r\nIf you are missing that in Mesos, then maybe the minimally disruptive change is:\r\n1. Build some id assignment microservice, most likely using zookeeper as you described above.  It would only be used on platforms like Mesos that lack built-in mechanisms for getting stable logical names.\r\n2. Modify the invoker/controller start up path so that we add a new option to get the stable name from that id assignment service instead of assuming it is provided as a command line argument.  Or, in Kubernetes I might set it up so that an init_container contacted the id assignment service so the main invoker/controller code could be completely unchanged.  Does Mesos have something like init containers?\r\n\r\nIf we can do that, then we could contain the change so it could be easily ignored in systems that don't need it. I guess you also need a hook on shutdown to release the id as well (although I'd be worried about assuming a clean shutdown; invokers especially tend to crash in ugly fashions occasionally.

can you elaborate on a) how is --uniqueName set and retained for StatefulSet/DaemonSet and b) what happens when a host vanishes in either case (is there any chance the --uniqueName for next new host is not set to a value that was already in use?). I tried to decipher this in the deploy-kube repo, but my only guess is that it comes from `.Values.invoker.name`, and it isn't clear how that would get populated.\r\n\r\nFor mesos, we can do some juggling to track state on the host, but what Chetan points out is that since the state is tracked at the host, when a host goes down completely (as opposed to invoker jvm crash), the --uniqueName that should be used for it's replacement will also be lost. \r\n\r\nIn general, this is super critical for invokers, but also important for controllers, where if a controller is revived and does not have precisely the right id (if it is replacing a previous controller instance), then the previous topic will be abandoned. \r\n\r\nThis dependency on the cluster manager for state I think is an antipattern since there is otherwise absolutely no need to track state afaik. I definitely recognize there is some convenient ways to do it, but ultimately it would be great for OW to not be so sensitive to host swapping, and really the only way to get there is to remove the id assignment from external systems, and coordinate it internally, probably with assistance from more generic visibility of current cluster state, but not dependent on the cluster state directly. \r\n\r\nOr, if k8s is truly impervious to host crash+swap scenarios where uniqueName is carefully reused, I agree this is probably not worth pursuing 😄.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/423251713/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/423299433","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/4033#issuecomment-423299433","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/4033","id":423299433,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMzI5OTQzMw==","user":{"login":"dubee","id":11520887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIwODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11520887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee","html_url":"https://github.com/dubee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-20T19:11:34Z","updated_at":"2018-09-20T19:18:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"PG1 3394 🔵 \r\nPG3 2806 🔵 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/423299433/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/423523941","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/3858#issuecomment-423523941","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/3858","id":423523941,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMzUyMzk0MQ==","user":{"login":"dgrove-oss","id":5099100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTkxMDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5099100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss","html_url":"https://github.com/dgrove-oss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-21T13:04:50Z","updated_at":"2018-09-21T13:04:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"StatefulSets are truly immune.  Kubernetes creates/recreates the pods with stable pod hostnames that include the ordinal number (eg controller-0, controller-1, etc).  If controller-0 exits for any reason, a new controller-0 is created to replace it.  This ordinal number based name is also available to the pod spec in the helm chart/yaml as `metadata.name`. \r\n\r\nDaemonSets are ensured that as long as the actual worker node is functional, that kubernetes will create/recreate a pod on that node and will set `spec.nodeName` to the ip address of the worker node.  So when using DockerContainerFactory for the invokers, there is a slight gap:  if a worker node becomes permanently disabled, then any work already assigned the invoker on that node will be stranded in its kafka topic.  In practice, I don't think this gap is really worth putting much effort into fixing.  The node can be rebooted/reimaged in a matter of minutes, which is almost always good enough to allow an invoker to be started on it again, which picks up the work.  Furthermore, if the deployment is using the KubernetesContainerFactory for the invokers (OpenShift does), then there is no gap.  In this configuration, we use a StatefulSet and as discussed with the controllers above, when elements of the StatefulSet are lost, they will be recreated with the missing ordinal number. So we can expect to always regain the expected number of invokers, with dense uniqueNames from 0 to N-1.
