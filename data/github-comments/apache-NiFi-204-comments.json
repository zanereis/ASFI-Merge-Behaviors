I think it makes sense to limit the support for `REMOTE_POLL_BATCH_SIZE` to the strategies `BY_ENTITIES` and `NO_TRACKING` only.

Thanks again for your work on this issue.\r\n\r\nAfter some additional discussion on [NIFI-11171](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11171), I think the best approach for now is to hold off on moving the FTP and SFTP components, as well as most others listed.\r\n\r\nThere is still some opportunity for improvement in terms of reducing the Proxy Configuration properties, and making that a clean migration using the migrate API methods.\r\n\r\nLonger term, the design of the SFTP components should be revisited to improve connection sharing and other things, but that would be addressed separately.\r\n\r\nI'm closing this pull request for now, but we can continue the discussion on the Jira issue as

However, I'd like to address a concern regarding its scope as this change only adresses a subset of the issue. Postgres maps `BOOLEAN` types to `BIT` due to historical reasons. By mapping `java.sql.Types.BIT` to `RecordFieldType.Boolean` in `DataTypeUtils::getDataTypeFromSQLTypeValue`, we may encounter a scenario where a field defined as `BIT` in the PostgreSQL table with a size specification such as `BIT(n)` where `n>2` cannot be represented as a `BOOLEAN` type, and though the record won't be converted by the JDBC driver the schema type is not valid. Consequently, the schema for such a field will also be defined as Boolean. @mattyb149, do you have any thoughts on this?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1965816504/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1967191097","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/8452#issuecomment-1967191097","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/8452","id":1967191097,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM51QPQ5","user":{"login":"tpalfy","id":53442425,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNDQyNDI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53442425?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy","html_url":"https://github.com/tpalfy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-27T17:11:05Z","updated_at":"2024-02-27T17:11:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM\r\nThank you @takraj for your work and @dan-s1 for the review.\r\nMerged to main and support/nifi-1.x","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1967191097/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1967366292","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/8445#issuecomment-1967366292","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/8445","id":1967366292,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM51Q6CU","user":{"login":"Lehel44","id":7498857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0OTg4NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7498857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lehel44","html_url":"https://github.com/Lehel44","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lehel44/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lehel44/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lehel44/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lehel44/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lehel44/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lehel44/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lehel44/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lehel44/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lehel44/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-27T18:36:58Z","updated_at":"2024-02-27T18:37:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Postgres does not recommend storing boolean values in BIT(1) columns because it introduces overhead, so we neither should support a conversion from BIT(1) to Boolean and everything else to Integer, I also think that all the BIT(n) and BIT VARYING(n) can be just converted to Integer.
