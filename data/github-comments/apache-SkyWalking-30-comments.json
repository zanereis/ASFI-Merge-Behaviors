You can't change the config file?\r\n\r\nThe key of this issue is to find out which classes are added into the Tomcat session. And are they enhanced by SkyWalking agent? such as: some cache client object? But from my understanding, we didn't intend to enhance any classes which may be added in to session. Only exception is only if Spring bean optional plugin is active, which you said you don't.
