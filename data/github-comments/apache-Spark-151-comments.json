Incase it is we must add a setting in pom reader that strips this. \n\n3) Jenkins flags the build as failed even though it passed.

What is the javadoc you refer to? I've looked at a few classes in org.apache.spark.examples and I don't really see a lot of comments.\n\nIf you're using spark-submit or run-example, you shouldn't be running into this issue (\"spark.master\" not set) at all. You'd only run into it if using spark-class directly.\n\nIn 0.9 the examples (or at least a few of them) used to take the master as the first argument. In 1.0.0 it seems the approach taken was to just ignore that argument since it's provided automatically by spark-submit. Your command line is \"backwards compatible\" although that one argument is just ignored. I don't know how important that is for examples, though - I'd rather have the examples as an example of how to write an app, and having that old argument there kinda defeats that purpose.\n\nSo, if there are docs telling people to run the examples directly with java or spark-class, we should fix those to use run-example / spark-submit instead.\n\nPerhaps a future approach could be to have a \"SparkApp\" base class that calls a \"run(SparkContext)\" method so that initializing the context clearly becomes the job of the framework. But that approach has all sorts of other issues.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/44899788/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/44899931","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/926#issuecomment-44899931","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/926","id":44899931,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0ODk5OTMx","user":{"login":"syedhashmi","id":2250747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTA3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2250747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/syedhashmi","html_url":"https://github.com/syedhashmi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syedhashmi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syedhashmi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syedhashmi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syedhashmi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syedhashmi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syedhashmi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syedhashmi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syedhashmi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syedhashmi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-06-02T22:35:30Z","updated_at":"2014-06-02T22:35:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@vanzin : I was running into this issue while trying to run and debug examples from intellij.

You are right that most examples tell you to use `run-example` and that works. One asks you set a `master` arg directly but it's just one.\n\nNothing wrong with that per se, but the code almost completely configures Spark, except for the master. At a glance, I thought it wasn't intentional, and that `spark.master` was supposed to default to `local[2]`.\n\nI don't quite like my change -- a global default is much simpler but has perhaps more implications.
