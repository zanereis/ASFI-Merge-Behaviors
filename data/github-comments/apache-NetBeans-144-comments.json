Steps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a clone of the JNA repository. In a directory of your choosing run `git clone https://github.com/java-native-access/jna.git`\r\n2. In your NetBeans Source Tree go to the last commit before your merge: `git checkout c07ee007fd18`\r\n3. Ensure directory is clean: `git clean -f -x -d`\r\n4. Build: `ant`\r\n5. Run tryme: `ant tryme`\r\n6. Open the JNA NetBeans project from the folder you cloned in step 1.\r\n7. Open test file NativeLibraryTest.java (Package com.sun.jna), go to line 91, right click on `disposeAll`, choose  Navigate -> Goto Source\r\n8. Observe, that you are taken to the Method `disposeAll` in `NativeLibrary.java`\r\n9. Close NetBeans\r\n10. Checkout your merge commit: `git checkout 2a9e190afaf799bd0c126f0ffc6c70c9f0f9a305`\r\n11. Build: `ant`\r\n12. Run tryme: `ant tryme`\r\n13. Repeat Step 7\r\n14.

I guess the problem is simpler (although harder to fix): some modules are recompiled even if nothing changes (typically due to some special tasks in their build.xml not performing the timestamp checks). `enterprise/j2ee.dd` seems to be one example - each time I run `ant` in its directory, it will re-compile and re-generate its module jar. As a consequence, all modules depending on `j2ee.dd` will see its dependency changed, and will (I think) recompile as well.\r\n\r\nSo, the solution is to find such modules, fix the build scripts to do nothing if nothing changes.

I did some more testing after my comment, as well as re-reading the docs for that task, and I think you're right that it's timestamps on the `cp` rather than a change in it.\r\n\r\nA simpler one to look at might be `org.openide.util.ui.svg`.  That one doesn't rebuild when running `ant` in its directory, and neither do any of the dependencies that I can tell.\r\n\r\nI had a suspicion that it might be related to `releasefilescopy` always running and overwriting files.  But I can't replicate that with running `ant` manually (eg. rebuilding batik module causes the files to be recopied, but that's not enough to trigger the svg module to recompile). Probably only files copied from inside archives get a different timestamp?  And I'm not sure the timestamp check here includes those files anyway? :man_shrugging: \r\n\r\nLost on this one.  Less concerned if we are confident the reason is not a difference in configuration when running the sub-ant task.

But I found a situation where the direct parent is not the optimal answer:\r\n\r\nthe editor tab dropdown can close tabs. If the tab is unsaved a dialog will appear. This dialog's parent would be the popup which causes it open on the upper right area of the main window.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't look horrible but its something to check. Simple yes/no dialogs should probably always open centered on the main window which might be the better default.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1381615972/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1381730263","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/5290#issuecomment-1381730263","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5290","id":1381730263,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5SW4fX","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-13T11:35:44Z","updated_at":"2023-01-13T11:35:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"all tests green. removing all-tests label for subsequent syncs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1381730263/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1381799576","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/5185#issuecomment-1381799576","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5185","id":1381799576,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5SXJaY","user":{"login":"JustLeonS","id":81434143,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNDM0MTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81434143?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JustLeonS","html_url":"https://github.com/JustLeonS","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JustLeonS/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JustLeonS/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JustLeonS/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JustLeonS/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JustLeonS/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JustLeonS/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JustLeonS/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JustLeonS/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JustLeonS/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-13T12:42:03Z","updated_at":"2023-01-13T12:42:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I believe this is a git issue, not NetBeans fault.
