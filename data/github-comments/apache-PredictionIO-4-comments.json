Since this will be a lot of work, can someone review please, or I'll just start the merge on my local copy.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/predictionio/issues/comments/238101461/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/predictionio/issues/comments/238140525","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/predictionio/pull/268#issuecomment-238140525","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/predictionio/issues/268","id":238140525,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzODE0MDUyNQ==","user":{"login":"maniteja6799","id":7857075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NTcwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7857075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maniteja6799","html_url":"https://github.com/maniteja6799","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maniteja6799/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maniteja6799/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maniteja6799/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maniteja6799/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maniteja6799/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maniteja6799/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maniteja6799/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maniteja6799/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maniteja6799/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-08T04:40:15Z","updated_at":"2016-08-08T04:40:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hello Donald,\nCan you please tell me how to open a ticket, Should i need an username,\npassword to create a new ticket, if so, how can i get one.

We should update the contributor guideline regarding the choice of merging and squashing.\n\nI believe Apache does not enforce how pull requests should be handled, and it is up to committers to pick a style. Typically squashing is good for a single author branch so that it is easier (debatable :)) for other people to read what is changed for a particular ticket. For multi-author branches, I echo with @jamesward that it should not be squashed, as it is impossible to credit the squashed commit to multiple authors.\n\n@HyukjinKwon, if you wouldn't mind please cherry pick those commits into a branch and I will merge them instead of squashing.
