[TINKERPOP-1044](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TINKERPOP-1044) was less about REST and more about the Gremlin Server protocol but as it turns out the issue is the same in REST as it is over there.  \n\n> there should be some common response between all channelizer methods that is defined in only one location\n\nThere's no such place to do that. There isn't any shared exception processing logic between REST and the Gremlin Server protocol. I think you would add that logic here:\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/850e159b8dc883ac3995c8d775b8f09b7a64b440/gremlin-server/src/main/java/org/apache/tinkerpop/gremlin/server/op/AbstractEvalOpProcessor.java#L260-L266\n\nas i look at it now the error messaging logic is a bit weird there to begin with (i.e. if we don't have an \"error message\" we just use the class simple name?? - no idea why that is like that). Note that there are a number of integration tests that may fail if with these changes you are making as they rely on the asserting error messages in some cases. If you haven't done so already please be sure to run those tests:\n\n``` text\nmvn clean install && mvn verify -pl gremlin-server -DskipIntegrationTests=false\n```\n\nAlso, please add an entry to the CHANGELOG that describes your fix:\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/850e159b8dc883ac3995c8d775b8f09b7a64b440/CHANGELOG.asciidoc#tinkerpop-323-release-date-not-officially-released-yet\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/250474605/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/250509441","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/444#issuecomment-250509441","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/444","id":250509441,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MDUwOTQ0MQ==","user":{"login":"dkuppitz","id":572377,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjM3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/572377?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz","html_url":"https://github.com/dkuppitz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-29T15:58:25Z","updated_at":"2016-09-29T15:58:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"```\ndaniel@cube /projects/apache/tinkerpop (TINKERPOP-1158) gremlin.sh -v emits log4j initialization errors $ bin/gremlin.sh -v\ngremlin 3.1.5-SNAPSHOT\ndaniel@cube /projects/apache/tinkerpop (TINKERPOP-1158) gremlin.sh -v emits log4j initialization errors $ cd gremlin-console/\ndaniel@cube /projects/apache/tinkerpop/gremlin-console (TINKERPOP-1158) gremlin.sh -v emits log4j initialization errors $ bin/gremlin.sh -v\ngremlin 3.1.5-SNAPSHOT\ndaniel@cube /projects/apache/tinkerpop/gremlin-console (TINKERPOP-1158) gremlin.sh -v emits log4j initialization errors $ cd target/apache-tinkerpop-gremlin-console-3.1.5-SNAPSHOT-standalone/\ndaniel@cube /projects/apache/tinkerpop/gremlin-console/target/apache-tinkerpop-gremlin-console-3.1.5-SNAPSHOT-standalone (TINKERPOP-1158) gremlin.sh -v emits log4j initialization errors $ bin/gremlin.sh -v\ngremlin 3.1.5-SNAPSHOT\n```\n\nWorks for me from all directories.

Primarily because it mimics the structure and content of Gremlin-Python. Ensuring consistency between all variants is important from a maintainability standpoint.\n\nHere are some concerns:\n1. I think we need a `RemoteConnection` implementation. From what I'm reading, it seems we don't have one.\n2. @mbroecheler was pushing for async methods in Gremlin-Java (thus, \"Gremlin\"). The idea was to have `Future<V> Traversal.async(Function<Traversal,V>)`. Thus, to do a \"future\" `toList()` in Java, you would do `result = g.V().out().async(Traversal::toList)`. I think we should do this in Gremlin-Java and then have this same \"callback\" model used by Gremlin-JS and thus, not have `one()` and `list()` with callbacks. Does that make sense?\n3. I don't see the Gremlin `ProcessTestSuite` being run. We will need `Providers` to do so. Please see how this works in Gremlin-Python. https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/tree/master/gremlin-python/src/test/java/org/apache/tinkerpop/gremlin/python/jsr223.\n4. We will need documentation in `gremlin-variants.asciidoc`.\n\nI suspect we will want to merge this first into an Apache TinkerPop branch and can nit pick things as I see them before an ultimate merge into `master/`. For instance, I can do 3 and 4 above if perhaps @jorgebay provides some notes so I get the important aspects in the documentation.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/251744589/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/251747144","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/450#issuecomment-251747144","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/450","id":251747144,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MTc0NzE0NA==","user":{"login":"okram","id":148925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODkyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/148925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram","html_url":"https://github.com/okram","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-05T17:46:47Z","updated_at":"2016-10-05T17:46:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I just created this ticket: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TINKERPOP-1490\n\n@jorgebay -- can you review that ticket in terms of the `one()`, `list()` callback model you are using here to see if we can get rid of `one()` and `list()` and supplant it with an `async()`. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/251747144/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/251760741","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/447#issuecomment-251760741","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/447","id":251760741,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MTc2MDc0MQ==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-05T18:36:10Z","updated_at":"2016-10-05T18:36:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This is a great PR.

I started going down that road to see how easy it would be and its actually pretty hard given how `GraphSONMapper` works -- and the need to register all strategies by class. Anywho... if we do decide to go down that route then in Gremlin-Python/etc. we would have `TraversalStrategy({config:map,is:this})`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/252034330/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/252034838","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/448#issuecomment-252034838","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/448","id":252034838,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MjAzNDgzOA==","user":{"login":"okram","id":148925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODkyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/148925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram","html_url":"https://github.com/okram","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-06T17:38:11Z","updated_at":"2016-10-06T17:38:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This looks good.

Much simpler, well tested, in general a nice PR. Pretty slick using the metaclass to create the de-/serializer maps. One thing I wonder: \n\nPresumably using the `GraphSONIO` instance methods `writeObject`/`toObject` instead of the previous class methods provides an advantage because we can now pass a custom serializer/deserializer map to the `GraphSONIO` instance, thus overriding/adding to the default serializers. However, the `GraphSONIO` instance is created inside the `DriverRemoteConnection` without the optional kwargs. I wonder if we should add `graphson_io=None` to the `__init__` method signature. In the case of `None`, we can instantiate the object as is:\n\n```\ndef __init__(self, url, traversal_source, username=\"\", password=\"\", loop=None, graphson_io=None):\n    if not graphson_io:\n        graphson_io = GraphSONIO()\n    self._graphson_io = graphson_io\n```\n\nThat way the user can take advantage of the new functionality provided by the kwargs.\n\nOther than that and my previous comment. This is LGTM.\n\nVOTE + 1\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/252355767/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/252361548","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/448#issuecomment-252361548","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/448","id":252361548,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MjM2MTU0OA==","user":{"login":"aholmberg","id":1443722,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDM3MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1443722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aholmberg","html_url":"https://github.com/aholmberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aholmberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aholmberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aholmberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aholmberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aholmberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aholmberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aholmberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aholmberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aholmberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-07T21:08:25Z","updated_at":"2016-10-07T21:08:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> graphson_io=None to the **init** method signature\n\nI think that is a fine idea.

Maybe this can be polyfilled under Nashorn? Using `Promise` could complement Node.js style async functions with a callback passed as last parameter (functions with such signature can be easily converted to functions returning a Promise [with many third-party Promise libraries such as Bluebird](http://bluebirdjs.com/docs/api/promise.promisify.html)). This way, a `Traversal` could be ended with something like `.toPromise()`. I think the following makes a lot of sense in JavaScript since it’s part of the standard:\n\n``` javascript\n// JavaScript\ng.V().out('created').toPromise()\n  .then(function (vertices) {\n    // do something with results\n  })\n  .catch(function (err) {\n    // handle error\n  })\n  .finally(function () {\n    // cleanup\n  });\n\n// Alternatively, the end user could use use a promisifying function over .toList():\ng.V().out('created').toListAsync()\n  .then()\n  .catch();\n```\n\nComing soon to the standard are `async` functions which return a `Promise`, so you could do this:\n\n``` javascript\n// JavaScript\nasync function followers() {\n  try {\n    const followers = await g.V().in('followers').toPromise();\n  } catch(e) {\n    // Handle error\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThere also are `Observable` (think: `Promise` with multiple return values, or `Array` but laid out over time rather than in memory) that are worth considering in JavaScript. Observable are candidate for being part of the standard. Libraries such as RxJS v5, which aims to be spec. compliant, works wonderfully. That way, we could also have `.toObservable()` in JavaScript:\n\n``` javascript\n// JavaScript\ng.V().out('created').toObservable()\n  .subscribe(\n    function (vertex) {\n      // This gets called once for each vertex\n    },\n    function (err) {\n      //  Handle errors\n    },\n    function () {\n      // Called when observable ends (ie. after last vertex is emitted)\n    }\n  )\n```\n\nI took a different path in Node.js and started developing [zer](https://github.com/jbmusso/zer) (short for seriali**zer**), a generic \"JavaScript-to-anything\" library that uses the ES2015 Proxy object. The lib builds an AST-ish (I'm learning these :P) which can output to anything, including Gremlin-Groovy (currently) and most likely Gremlin-bytcode easily (it could also output to SQL or Cypher, but hey). The trick is to `Proxy()`ify a `Function` (rather than an `Object`) and intercept calls to that function with `Proxy.apply()` and mutation of that function properties with `Proxy.get()` (you can do both since functions are objects in JavaScript).\nThe `zer` lib allows generating queries such as `g.V().out().in().bla().method().not().in().tinkerpop().source().code()` (Grooovy output) but it could easily support things like `select().from().where()` (and produce SQL-output). Coding the gremlin-bytecode output should be trivial. It also supports nested traversals and automatic escaping of bound parameters (it basically escapes all primitives and anything that is not a `Traversal`). I think it could also support serializing functions/lambdas since you can do `Function.toString()` in JavaScript and extract the function body at runtime.\n\nI don’t think that the Proxy approach can work in Nashorn since Proxy can’t be emulated in ES5 environment (it only works in Node v6 I recall, maybe Node v5).

I think it could be a method overload: user provides a function, use it as callback; otherwise, return a promise. For runtimes that don't support promises, if no callback is provided, throw an error. That way we can support all ES5+ runtimes (nashorn, nodejs, browser js engines).\nExample:\n\n``` javascript\n// callback provided\ng.V().hasLabel('person').toList((err, people) => { \n  people.forEach(console.log);\n});\n// callback not provided, a promise is returned\nconst peoplePromise = g.V().hasLabel('software').toList();\n```\n\nPromises in the Javascript landscape had the added benefit that can be used along side generators (ES2015) and async/await (ES2017) in newer runtimes.\n\n``` javascript\n// inside a generator\nconst people = yield peoplePromise;\n// inside an async function\nconst people = await peoplePromise;\n```\n\nI think that if we provide both callback and promise method overloads, we can avoid the need of a Promise polyfill.\n\nAbout method generation:\nI think the approach used by the Python GLV of generating methods is still more user friendly than capture a function invocation. Using proxies is an elegant solution, but compile time generated methods have several benefits over [Javascript Proxy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) approach: \n- Compilers can optimize generated code.\n- We can filter out Traversal/TraversalSource methods that we want to handle differently.\n- Node.js active LTS (v4) and most popular runtimes don't support it yet.\n- The generated source is a defined API.\n\nThat way we could use the same approach from Python for all supported languages.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/252911095/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/252970187","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/454#issuecomment-252970187","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/454","id":252970187,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1Mjk3MDE4Nw==","user":{"login":"twilmes","id":4722637,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MjI2Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4722637?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twilmes","html_url":"https://github.com/twilmes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twilmes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twilmes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twilmes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twilmes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twilmes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twilmes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twilmes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twilmes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twilmes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-11T16:30:19Z","updated_at":"2016-10-11T16:30:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The conversions and additional changes all look good.\n\nVOTE: +1\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/252970187/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/252974570","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/448#issuecomment-252974570","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/448","id":252974570,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1Mjk3NDU3MA==","user":{"login":"aholmberg","id":1443722,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDM3MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1443722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aholmberg","html_url":"https://github.com/aholmberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aholmberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aholmberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aholmberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aholmberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aholmberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aholmberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aholmberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aholmberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aholmberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-11T16:46:35Z","updated_at":"2016-10-11T16:46:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks.

Can you help me understand the use case in the context of this GLV, where client IO uses a single format?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/252974570/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/252984663","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/448#issuecomment-252984663","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/448","id":252984663,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1Mjk4NDY2Mw==","user":{"login":"okram","id":148925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODkyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/148925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram","html_url":"https://github.com/okram","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-11T17:23:01Z","updated_at":"2016-10-11T17:33:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@aholmberg We have had a distinction between reader/writer since the beginning of TinkerPop.
