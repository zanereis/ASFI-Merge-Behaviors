\r\n\r\n多谢指出这些。\r\n\r\n> 文档上写的返回值是number或数组，你的PR里测试写的是返回string。。。\r\n看来文档上是写错了。`symbolSize` 是返回 `number|Array.<number>`，而 `symbol` 是返回 `string`。\r\n\r\n我修改下文档。\r\n\r\n> PR #10580 又把你修改的symbol.js改了，现在的master里symbol.createSymbol也同样没有处理Function。 @100pah 请问为什么要去掉这个PR里的335行这部分代码？\r\n\r\n335 行是这么写的：\r\n```js\r\n    var isFunction = typeof symbolType === 'function'\r\n    if

阶段的帮助方法集合。\r\n而 function 类型的 symbolType，和 function 类型的 symbolSize 一样，应该在\r\n\"visual\" 阶段处理，即 `src/visual/symbol.js` 中处理。\r\n进入 `createSymbol` 已经是 ”view“ 阶段，这时候 symbolType 应该已经是 string
