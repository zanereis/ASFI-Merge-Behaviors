Though Atlas notification has a filed named 'user', this can't be used for authorization, as it trusts the senders to set correct value. Hence it is very important that ACLs on ATLAS_HOOKS Kafka topic is set carefully - to allow only trusted users to produce messages.\r\n> \r\n> In short, notification mechanism must only be used for trusted users. For usecases that involve calls from untrusted users, which require authorizations, REST APIs should be used.\r\n\r\nI completely agree, that there is no good way to guarantee that user name in message is correct and validated.\r\nI see it more like addition to topic ACL, which is main mechanism that grants access for posting messages.\r\nThe issue with ACL is that is all-or-noting approach, without fine grained control of what user can do in atlas. \r\nOn the other hand even if user will set any value for the user field, there is still external service (ranger policy) which is being checked and user cannot setup policy himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/atlas/issues/comments/500199699/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/atlas/issues/comments/500287485","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/atlas/pull/58#issuecomment-500287485","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/atlas/issues/58","id":500287485,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMDI4NzQ4NQ==","user":{"login":"mneethiraj","id":7771561,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3NzE1NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7771561?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mneethiraj","html_url":"https://github.com/mneethiraj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mneethiraj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mneethiraj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mneethiraj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mneethiraj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mneethiraj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mneethiraj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mneethiraj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mneethiraj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mneethiraj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-10T04:25:02Z","updated_at":"2019-06-10T04:25:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@arempter - I agree that authorizing based on username in the message can provide an additional layer of control.
