Similarly, part of per-channel scale rely on brittle heuristics, but we expect to improve these over time as we evaluate more models and understand more about the general patterns in quantization.\r\n\r\nThe previous quantization process used three passes: `annotate`, \"`calibrate`\" (which only calibrated weights), and `realize`, which materializes concrete domain scale compensations between layers and the required casts between `int8` and `int32`.\r\n\r\nAt a high level, this PR changes the pass order/structure slightly to:\r\n1. `annotate` (same as before, with a few additional properties of the graph captures, such as data layout). Data layout is important for inferring the number of channels and the channel dimension in data/weight tensors.\r\n2. First `calibration`. This first `calibration` step calibrates weights as before, but also marks intermediate activations as outputs of the graph so that they can be profiled.\r\n3. Profiling/evaluation: the network is executed on a small set of training data (currently on the order of a small mini batch or 32 samples) so that the intermediate activations can be profiled.\r\n4. Second `calibration`. We use MSE to choose a domain scale to calibrate each of the profiled activations.\r\n5. Scale matching (only for per-channel scale). Due to the fact that quantization relies on integer hardware, scales must match in the middle of a kernel. Here, we manipulate the per-channel scales to compensate for any differences after the multiply phase of the convolution and tune them so that scales are matched during accumulation.\r\n6. `realize` is the same as before but can handle vector domain scales instead of scalar domain scales.\r\n\r\nSome issues with currently include:\r\n+ Inferring the correct number of channels and the channel dimension becomes very difficult with arbitrary data layouts.\r\n+ Inferring the number of channels can also be tricky with a wide variety of operators and operator broadcasting conventions (e.g., how many channels should be given the constant tensor in an `add(activation, constant)` operator when the constant has shape (`1,1000)`?). In many cases, more than local information is needed.\r\n+ Concatenating multiple tensors currently simply results in the maximum scales across all tensors being used with per-layer scales.\r\n+ We require a dataset for calibration and a uniform API for passing this data. Currently, this is relatively straightforward for vision models (e.g., we can use MxNet format and MxNet iterators), but it is not clear how we want to support other domains.\r\n\r\nCurrent accuracy
