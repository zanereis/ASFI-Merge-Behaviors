Hi vinothchandar:\r\nConcurrent writing to HoodieParquetWriter occurs at following code\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/master/hudi-client/hudi-spark-client/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/table/action/commit/SparkMergeHelper.java#L103\r\nWhen speculation is triggered, we call mergeHandle.close which calls parquetWriter close method. At the same time, boundedInMemoryExecutor is still working, so write method of mergeHandle is called at same time which call write method of parquetWriter.\r\nAnd parquetWriter does have a state which is not thread safe. It holds BytesInput which is used as internal data storage in parquet column format, it is not thread safe and its life cycle is managed by parquetWriter.  So parquet writer must transfer its state in a serializable way. When it is being written, a reset command may not totally clear it as expected. Such data structure is reused within JVM. A non-cleared bytesInput may return wrong result in following usage.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/994684618/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/994697240","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/4154#issuecomment-994697240","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4154","id":994697240,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM47SeAY","user":{"login":"danny0405","id":7644508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NDQ1MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7644508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405","html_url":"https://github.com/danny0405","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-15T11:24:41Z","updated_at":"2021-12-15T11:24:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Our flink sql on 0.10.0 is also failing, i have checked the metadata is correct, i suspect there was something wrong with the filesystem view strategy for replace commit.

Even though HFile is a supported base file format, it can really not be used as a base format in HUDI as there is no concrete query side support on query engines\r\n2. The way the records are saved in HFile (HFile key=hoodie record key, HFile value=avro encoded record) has been invented for HUDI specific usecase and hence cannot be used directly without writing a HUDI specific record reader.\r\n3. If this setting is ever enabled, there is no going back (no downgrade, no disabling the setting) without blowing up the metadata table (or any dataset using HFile format).\r\n4. This PR introduces a lot of plumbing code just to get a setting over to the HFileWriter. The main functionality of not writing the key is a small part of change.\r\n5. I personally feel having too many configs and options without thinking of the use-cases is not a good idea from maintenance, testing and upgrade perspective. Why even give the user this choice to duplicate or de-duplicate when we are actually inventing how records are saved within the HFile? \r\n6. Such settings within HUDI (like base file format, log file format, key column, etc) should not be controlled through HoodieWriteConfig because once enabled it is not safe to ever disable them at will. Hence, we should think of a simpler way of enabling/disabling such settings (maybe through the hoodie.properties)\r\n7. There are other such features which have similar downgrade issues - e.g. virtual key support - which when enabled once cannot be downgraded in-place without blowing up the data and re-bootstrapping.\r\n\r\nSo based on the above notes, I feel we should make de-duplication the only way and simplify the code. \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/996247192/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/996281613","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/4333#issuecomment-996281613","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4333","id":996281613,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM47Yg0N","user":{"login":"alexeykudinkin","id":428277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin","html_url":"https://github.com/alexeykudinkin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-16T23:48:35Z","updated_at":"2021-12-16T23:48:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@hudi-bot run azure","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/996281613/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/996384077","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/4343#issuecomment-996384077","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4343","id":996384077,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM47Y51N","user":{"login":"hudi-bot","id":79415918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDE1OTE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79415918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/hudi-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-17T02:26:26Z","updated_at":"2021-12-17T02:26:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\nMeta data\n{\n  \"version\" : 1,\n  \"metaDataEntries\" : [ {\n    \"hash\" : \"7c90c6a6dbc40a02054488dc72255be8560a0afe\",\n    \"status\" : \"DELETED\",\n    \"url\" : \"https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=4390\",\n    \"triggerID\" : \"7c90c6a6dbc40a02054488dc72255be8560a0afe\",\n    \"triggerType\" : \"PUSH\"\n  }, {\n    \"hash\" : \"312706200b4c844bfb4a2bbd4f43dd2b95db7a2b\",\n    \"status\" : \"DELETED\",\n    \"url\" : \"https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=4394\",\n    \"triggerID\" : \"312706200b4c844bfb4a2bbd4f43dd2b95db7a2b\",\n    \"triggerType\" : \"PUSH\"\n  }, {\n    \"hash\" : \"0293f8239f842e078084be4324c1b84d081af135\",\n    \"status\" : \"FAILURE\",\n    \"url\" : \"https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=4397\",\n    \"triggerID\" : \"0293f8239f842e078084be4324c1b84d081af135\",\n    \"triggerType\" : \"PUSH\"\n  } ]\n}-->\n## CI report:\n\n* 0293f8239f842e078084be4324c1b84d081af135 Azure: [FAILURE](https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=4397) \n\n<details>\n<summary>Bot commands</summary>\n  @hudi-bot supports the following commands:\n\n -
