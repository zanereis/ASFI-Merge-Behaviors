is one of the best project documentations that I have seen. Thanks a lot Ufuk for doing this! I would merge this as is.\n\nFew minor thoughts I had when skimming through the docs:\n- Perhaps we can find a better font for the code samples (not sure if applicable in this PR, perhaps this is a separate PR with a bunch of content refactoring)\n- Was it not possible to have the navigation on the left or was it a conscious choice to have it on the right?\n- Move Flink on Tez under Setup, since programming a job is the same, deployment is different?\n- \"Programming guides\" seems a bit too narrow for what it contains (e.g., Local/Cluster execution). Perhaps rename to \"Usage\"?\n- Not sure if the whole internals section is better fit for the docs or the wiki, but this is a ML discussion\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/93837926/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/93929395","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/582#issuecomment-93929395","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/582","id":93929395,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDkzOTI5Mzk1","user":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-17T07:15:42Z","updated_at":"2015-04-17T07:15:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Maybe we could add in the test case the case where we have an `Object` array.

I had only some minor comments.\n\nWhat would be really awesome is to create some documentation for the website. You can look at flink/docs/ml/ to see how the other components are documented. It's basically the scala doc of the class.\n\nAnother thing to think about is the way we use Breeze operators. At the moment you have specified all operators with a preceding colon. This is perfectly fine but I personally use it only where it's necessary. For example, if you multiply a vector with a double you can also write `vector * double`. Of course this operation is also an element wise operation but IMHO I think it's easier to parse a formula if you use the colon syntax only if both operands are vectors. That way, another person can directly spot that this operation is a element-wise vector vector multiplication. What do you think?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/93954174/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/93956039","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/604#issuecomment-93956039","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/604","id":93956039,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDkzOTU2MDM5","user":{"login":"rmetzger","id":89049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger","html_url":"https://github.com/rmetzger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-17T09:56:57Z","updated_at":"2015-04-17T09:56:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It

Thanks for the quick update ^^\nThe result looks good, but I have a few more comments/suggestions (apart from the inline ones).\n- +1 for the `groupReduce*` implementations. These look great :-)\n- Regarding the combinable versions, I think that the current API is not very intuitive. I understand that you did it like this because you were restricted by the return type of the `ReduceFunction`. I think that it would be better if we simplify these to operate directly on the values, instead of tuples with nested Edge and Vertex data.\n  For example, say you want to compute the sum of all out-neighbors of a vertex. The value types to combine inside the reduce function should be the same as the vertex value type, instead of a Tuple3.\n  In the case of reducing on edges, the type should be the same as the edge value type.\n  Thus, I would make `reduceOnEdges` return `DataSet<Tuple2<K, EV>` and `reduceOnNeighbors` return `DataSet<Tuple2<K, VV>`, i.e. one value per vertex ID.\n-  There is some inconsistency in the naming of the methods, for example the user-defined methods in the group case are called `iterateOn...` and in the reduce case they are called `reduce...`. We should stick to one of these :-) Also, maybe we could find a better name for `ReduceEdgesFunction` and `ReduceNeighborsFunction`. I don't have a suggestion right now, but I'll think about it.\n-  Finally, there are several warnings in your code for unchecked and raw types. Could you turn on warning notifications in your IDE and try to add suppress annotations to get of them?\n\nLet me know what you think and whether you have any questions!\n\nThanks again!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/93996607/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/94002207","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/598#issuecomment-94002207","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/598","id":94002207,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk0MDAyMjA3","user":{"login":"vasia","id":498957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5ODk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/498957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia","html_url":"https://github.com/vasia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-17T14:55:28Z","updated_at":"2015-04-17T14:55:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @markus-h!\nI see the point in having a bulk iteration in Gelly, however I'm not sure I would add it as a \"mode\" in vertex-centric iteration.

I thought about this extension in a different way. Whenever you have a graph that is too big to process it with delta iteration you could just turn on bulk mode to get the computation done. It will be a lot slower, but sometimes this might be better then not getting any results.\nI dont think a dedicated bulk operator would be very useful. People can just use plain Flink if they dont need the Pregel abstraction. And in most cases it would be much slower then using the current solution.\n\nYou know gelly and its usecases a lot better then me. If you dont think that a mode like this might be userful I am totally find with that.

Thanks for the update :-)\n\nI left a few inline comments. Overall it looks good, I just had a little trouble following the logic in `VertexCentricIteration` with your changes. I think it could be simplified a bit, so that all configuration options are set in one place. Other that that, there are some javadocs missing, please make sure to add a description on every public method.\n\nOne concern I have is whether the `Vertex` class is the right place for the degrees fields and methods. These should be available only inside the iteration methods. In the current implementation one can use the public `setInDegree` method and then retrieve the value, regardless of whether that happens inside an iteration or whether it was set in the configuration. Could we instead create methods inside the `VertexUpdateFunction` and `MessagingFunction`? Something like `getVertexInDegree()` instead of `vertex.getInDegree()`? Or do you have a better idea?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/94167112/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/94175152","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/600#issuecomment-94175152","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/600","id":94175152,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk0MTc1MTUy","user":{"login":"vasia","id":498957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5ODk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/498957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia","html_url":"https://github.com/vasia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-18T15:44:28Z","updated_at":"2015-04-18T15:44:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I like it that you are using the example to show the migration process, but I think it would also be helpful to add a section with more general guidelines, describing all the differences between Spargel and Gelly.\n\nAmong others possibly, we should cover the following:\n- Gelly has Vertex and Edge type whereas Spargel operates on Tuple2 and Tuple3\n- Spargel has separate methods for edges with values and edges without values.

I am very sorry for not replying earlier, but I was extremely busy this week with other things. I will try to address the issues that you mentioned:\n\n> It supports only java.io.Serializable types. This is a bit inconsistent with the current type handling and serialization in Flink. Some types that work in all other parts do not work here.\n\nSorry, I will fix this.\n\n> It does not work in a cluster. It sends \"localhost\" as the name to the worker who should send the data back. In any non-local setup, this cannot work.\n\nIt doesn't send \"localhost\". It sends InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostName(), which will be some real hostname of the machine. (Something like the \"hostname\" Linux command would give.)\n\n> It requires the worker to be able to connect to the client. This may be tricky, when the client and workers do not run both in the cluster.\n\nIf I put this in \"contrib\", as you suggested later, is it then an acceptable assumption that the worker should be able to connect to the client, or should I find some other way to make the connection?\n\n> Selecting the proper interface that opens the port for data communication is actually quite tricky.\n\nI will modify the code to open the server in a way that it listens on all interfaces. (Actually, it already does that. bind(null) binds the socket to 0.0.0.0 (which means to listen on all interfaces), according to the JDK source code. But the Java API documentation doesn't say this explicitly, so I will use the ServerSocket constructor instead (with null as bindAddr), for which the documentation agrees with the source that it will listen on all interfaces.) I will also take a look at how the TaskManager does this.\n\n> What about reworking this as a library function and add it to flink-contrib?\n\nOK, I will make the modification.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/94310035/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/94392457","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/112#issuecomment-94392457","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/112","id":94392457,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk0MzkyNDU3","user":{"login":"rmetzger","id":89049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger","html_url":"https://github.com/rmetzger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-20T08:31:13Z","updated_at":"2015-04-20T08:31:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think we can close this pull request.\n\nThis PR is not adding new methods for getting metrics from the system.

I agree with separating the contribution as a library, however I have a question. The reason I have used a specialized method in the RuntimeEnvironment, is that for the OperatorStatsAccumulator, we do not want to only track the accumulated statistics per job, but also keep an array of the statistics collected at each task. The subtaskIndex which part of the RuntimeEnvironment is passed as a parameter to the constructor of the accumulator so that we can track which subtask is associated to which stats. Any ideas as to how I could use the same accumulator infrastructure but be able to associate an accumulated value with a given subtask?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/94401122/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/94402062","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/202#issuecomment-94402062","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/202","id":94402062,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk0NDAyMDYy","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-20T09:13:50Z","updated_at":"2015-04-20T09:13:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@aljoscha Timeout is removed.

Hence the different names. \n  Imagine something like this:\n  Tuple2<K, Edge<K, EV>> iterateOnEdges(Tuple2<K, Edge<K, EV>> firstEdge, Tuple2<K, Edge<K, EV>> secondEdge);\n  when you're not iterating on anything(or vice-versa reduceOnEdges(Iterable edges)).\n- I know ReduceEdgesFunction is not a pretty name, but I don't have another one, ReduceFunction is already taken :P.
