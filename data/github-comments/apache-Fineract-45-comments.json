I appreciate.\r\nYour point is probably valid and in some corner cases this doesn't work and I'm not sure if this is going to work in all environments.\r\n\r\nThe reason why on Windows this didn't work is because the file URI schema is not followed. \r\nThe `file://` prefix is missing an extra slash since it's pointing to a local file. According to the RFC, this is not a valid URI scheme for files but some systems accept it. [RFC here](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8089#appendix-B)\r\n\r\nTo make sure this still works the way it should, instead of removing the file URI prefix, I added the extra missing slash to make sure it's compliant with the RFC and that's something Windows also accepts. The end result is `file:///`\r\n\r\nSee the updated PR.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/1032397557/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/1034196211","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/2030#issuecomment-1034196211","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/2030","id":1034196211,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAuLPJ849pJTz","user":{"login":"vidakovic","id":380079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MDA3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/380079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic","html_url":"https://github.com/vidakovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-09T21:11:31Z","updated_at":"2022-02-09T21:11:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Just as a FYI for everyone who comes across this PR: the intention is to merge this **AFTER** we've done the 1.6 release","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/1034196211/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/1034338011","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/1984#issuecomment-1034338011","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/1984","id":1034338011,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAuLPJ849pr7b","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-10T00:09:53Z","updated_at":"2022-02-10T00:09:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This pull request seems to be stale.
