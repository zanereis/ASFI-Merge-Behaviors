good question would be how are people currently deploying their myriad servers, if they are using some kind of configuration management tool, this makes live much easier if you want to change the

config is already set as I had done.\n\nThat said if you think its best to go the other way then how would you recommend making such an assertion, is there a yarn endpoint we can call to see if that
