PR #7161 imposed a new default behavior that changed the distribution from simple keyBy on tuples with all partition columns to a custom partitioner with only bucket column. To me, the partition strategy is questionable. Bucket column is used here mainly to work around the OOM issue caused by skewed data distribution across partition columns and unbalanced value distribution from simple keyBy.\r\n\r\nIn the end, I feel it is safer to revert the behavior change from PR #7161 and ask users to manually apply the customer partitioner for the bucket column. Previously, we were thinking about automatically enable it when the partition spec has a bucketing column and hash distribution is set in table

However, it doesn't have significant issues under Parquet because Avro natively supports STRING and BYTES types, whereas Parquet only has the Binary type (whether the field is a String is determined by additional annotations or external metadata).\r\n- The data type read should be consistent with the iceberg column type, so I think Spark should also incorporate this modification.\r\n- Additionally, Iceberg has a UUID type, which seems to be supported in Spark but not in Flink: https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/7496","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1767764825/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1767781293","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/8808#issuecomment-1767781293","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/8808","id":1767781293,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85pXjOt","user":{"login":"nastra","id":271029,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MTAyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/271029?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra","html_url":"https://github.com/nastra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-18T06:48:29Z","updated_at":"2023-10-18T06:48:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Additionally, Iceberg has a UUID type, which seems to be supported in Spark but not in Flink: https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/7496\r\n\r\nSo Spark itself doesn't support UUIDs as a type, but rather expresses them as Strings.
