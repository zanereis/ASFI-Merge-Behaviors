this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1382353479/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1382964228","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1289#issuecomment-1382964228","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1289","id":1382964228,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5SblwE","user":{"login":"magibney","id":6225104,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMjUxMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6225104?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/magibney","html_url":"https://github.com/magibney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magibney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magibney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magibney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magibney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magibney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magibney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magibney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magibney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magibney/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-14T23:34:54Z","updated_at":"2023-01-14T23:34:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing

One could argue we have similar things already -- EmbeddedSolrServer, JettySolrRunner, MiniSolrCloudCluster, and corresponding base classes.  But the look & feel is very different.  So the aim standardizes the approach between them so that using any of these requires little new knowledge.  This isn't evident in this PR as it's just one rule but there are more to create.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1402176092/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1403144847","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1303#issuecomment-1403144847","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1303","id":1403144847,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5TokqP","user":{"login":"dsmiley","id":377295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzI5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/377295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley","html_url":"https://github.com/dsmiley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-25T06:10:14Z","updated_at":"2023-01-25T06:10:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I imagine Crave might work on a \"self hosted runner\" _eventually_ instead of indirectly using GitHub runner:\r\nhttps://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1403144847/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1403146619","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1303#issuecomment-1403146619","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1303","id":1403146619,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5TolF7","user":{"login":"dsmiley","id":377295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzI5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/377295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley","html_url":"https://github.com/dsmiley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-25T06:12:44Z","updated_at":"2023-01-25T06:12:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looking at the GH Action results, the crave executable failed because of no crave conf:\r\n> Error: Configuration file not found.

Thanks for the suggestion @dsmiley \r\n\r\nTwo initial questions I'd have:\r\n\r\n1. Does it bring along any sort of overhead?  I see it's tracking a bunch of metrics and historical data for cache entries, computing RAM usage estimates, etc.  Does that stuff have any non-negligible cost?  Seemed reasonable to ask as performance is the driving motivation for this PR...\r\n2. I understand the drive of switching from RefCounted to `WeakReference`.

What does switching the enclosing data structure from ConcurrentHashMap to CaffeineCache get us - we don't need (or want?) cache-eviction or any of the other stuff that CC would bring, unless I'm missing some reason we'd need to evict?

User error on my part -- doh!  Maybe if that dependency analysis could dependOn \"check\".  I took a quick stab at this; sorta worked, sorta didn't.  Then I noticed it's likely the latest version of this plugin added this.  I don't see where we specify a version to use for this plugin.\r\n\r\nRE \"api\":  Here's a practical example.  The solr:hadoop-auth module depends on solr:core (obviously).  Solr:core has an \"api\" dependency on solr:solrj-zookeeper.  The idea is that we have a dependency that is significant / prominent; it's not an internal implementation detail.  Its types show up in public methods/classes of solr-core in places.  Thus I think it's needlessly verbose for solr:hadoop-auth's build (or any other things that depend on solr-core) to specify any of solr-core's \"api\" dependencies.  These dependencies are on the surface, not buried below (like Guava say).  Today it has to because of this build dependency analysis plugin.  This plugin was ported from the Maven world where this \"api\" vs \"implementation\" distinction didn't exist.

I would not be surprised if hadoop-auth is using classes directly from solrj-zookeeper so it needs to be defined in hadoop-auth. This protects against solr:core from removing the api dependency on solrj-zookeeper and breaking hadoop-auth module. It sounds obvious to a human that we would never remove solrj-zookeeper as an api dependency from core, but the computer doesn't know that. so we need to be explicit there on the hadoop-auth module.\r\n\r\nI think the more interesting part is the ability to remove dependencies when they are no longer referenced - the negative to your example. Say guava or commons-io was removed from module classes (ie: replaced with JDK classes) in theory the dependency analysis would say \"hey you have too many dependencies declared and they can now be removed\" - this would also go for the case if hadoop-auth removed whatever was referring to solrj-zookeeper.\r\n\r\nI understand the example you are giving, but we don't have to declare EVERY dependency form solr:core in hadoop-auth - only the ones that hadoop-auth is actually using in its classes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1407136130/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1407268031","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1313#issuecomment-1407268031","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1313","id":1407268031,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5T4TS_","user":{"login":"risdenk","id":3384157,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzODQxNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3384157?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk","html_url":"https://github.com/risdenk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-28T03:00:09Z","updated_at":"2023-01-28T03:00:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I don't see where we specify a version to use for this plugin.\r\n\r\nSome (all?) of the plugin versions are here: https://github.com/apache/solr/blob/main/build.gradle#L21","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1407268031/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1407285268","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1313#issuecomment-1407285268","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1313","id":1407285268,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5T4XgU","user":{"login":"dsmiley","id":377295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzI5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/377295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley","html_url":"https://github.com/dsmiley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-28T04:32:27Z","updated_at":"2023-01-28T04:32:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":">  It sounds obvious to a human that we would never remove solrj-zookeeper as an api dependency from core, but the computer doesn't know that. so we need to be explicit there on the hadoop-auth module.\r\n\r\n\"need\"?
