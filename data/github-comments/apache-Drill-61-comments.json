If anything else fails, it is probably due to problems with the (new) builds or master; we'll have to check.\r\n\r\nThis PR includes no tests. It would be great to add some. Some example test cases:\r\n\r\n* htpasswd enabled, but no file path or default file found.\r\n* Enabled, and valid file in default location.\r\n* Enabled, and valid file in custom location.\r\n* File contents change to become invalid.\r\n* File contents change and are valid.\r\n\r\nTo test you'll need to first set up the server to enable the web server, which is turned off by default in tests. For testing, we use something called the `ClusterFixture`. Most tests are based off of `ClusterTest` which set up the server once per test file. For your tests, you may want to start the server in each test case, each with a different configuration. `StatusResourcesTest` is a good example.\r\n\r\nThe config you need is probably something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    ClusterFixtureBuilder builder = ClusterFixture.builder(dirTestWatcher).\r\n      configProperty(ExecConstants.HTTP_ENABLE, true).\r\n      configProperty(ExecConstants.HTTP_PORT_HUNT, true).\r\n      configProperty(ExecConstants.HTPASSWD_AUTHENTICATOR_PATH, \"whatever\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext you'll need a way to talk to the REST server. There is a `RestClientFixture` class which looks promising, though I've not used it myself.\r\n\r\nYou will need a place to create and update the file. The `BaseDirTestWatcher` class does this, often provided in tests as `dirTestWatcher`. See `TestDotDrillUtil` for an example of getting a test-specific temp directory and writing a file to that location. You can then use the temp directory as your custom auth file location when configuring the Drillbit.\r\n\r\nWith this, you can test the \"happy path\":\r\n\r\n* Enabled, and valid file in custom location.\r\n* File contents change and are valid.\r\n\r\nA bit more work is needed for the other cases. To test this one:\r\n\r\n* Enabled, and valid file in default location.\r\n\r\nYou can put the htpasswd in `src/test/resources` which will be on the classpath when running tests. The challenge is that the file is static; if we have the file, there is no way to test errors if the file *does not* exist. Sigh.\r\n\r\nFinally, checking the error cases is a nice-to-have, but is rather tricky. The errors don't kill the server, they only leave a trace in the log file. So, you can use two other tricks. One is `LogFixture` which lets you temporarily turn on logging. You won't need that because your code logs errors at the `error` level which is always enabled.\r\n\r\nTo capture log messages, you can try something like `TestOperatorDump`: create an in-memory log appender. Yes, it would be nice if this capability were part of `LogFixture`; a nice little project when someone has the time.\r\n\r\nMy recommendation is to at least test the \"happy path\"; add the others only if you feel so inclined.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/584816302/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/584926786","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1977#issuecomment-584926786","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1977","id":584926786,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NDkyNjc4Ng==","user":{"login":"dobesv","id":327833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNzgzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/327833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dobesv","html_url":"https://github.com/dobesv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dobesv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dobesv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dobesv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dobesv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dobesv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dobesv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dobesv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dobesv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dobesv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-11T23:58:55Z","updated_at":"2020-02-12T00:01:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@paul-rogers \r\n\r\nI added some tests and cleaned up the logic slightly.\r\n\r\nI didn't add tests for the REST API, since the password logic is shared between both systems I don't think this requires separate testing.\r\n\r\nI couldn't figure out a sane way to test the stuff related to the default path and I didn't do anything related to loading the file from the classpath.

HDF5 is like a filesystem within a file, so it can contain many datasets.  The dataset query looks at a specific dataset and projects the columns and rows as you would expect.\r\n\r\nMetadata queries are intended to explore the HDF5 itself rather than an individual dataset.  As currently implemented, in metadata queries, the plugin will return the filename, paths, dataset types, from the HDF5 file.  Here's where the problem arose... The metadata query also maps each dataset to a cell in each row.  This is useful because the user gets a preview of the data that is actually in each dataset, however if that dataset is larger than 16MB, Drill crashes.  When I originally implemented this (before EVF) this wasn't an issue because the plugin itself handled pushdown projection, and therefore all the user had to do was exclude the dataset from the query.  However, with EVF it doesn't work that way. \r\n\r\nTherefore options are:\r\n1.   Remove this preview functionality entirely \r\n2.  Select some small amount from each dataset and project that in a metadata query \r\n3.  Add a config option to not generate the preview columns in metadata querires. \r\n4.  Convert preview to a string and truncate at size limit. \r\n\r\nOf these options, option 3 felt the easiest and most useful to me as it preserved the functionality and gave the users a way to make it work. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/585184636/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/585212808","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1978#issuecomment-585212808","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1978","id":585212808,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NTIxMjgwOA==","user":{"login":"vvysotskyi","id":20928429,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTI4NDI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20928429?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi","html_url":"https://github.com/vvysotskyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-12T13:47:43Z","updated_at":"2020-02-12T13:47:43Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@cgivre, thanks for the explanation.

The problem description is vague. Is there a stack trace somewhere?\r\n\r\nEVF is designed to limit individual vectors to 16MB. Once you hit that size, EVF does an \"overflow\" move: it copies the last record (the one that does not fit) into a new batch, then tell you to return the now-full batch.\r\n\r\nIf you are seeing a crash, it could be that there is a bit in the overflow logic. (That logic is quite complex.) The proper fix, then, would be for me to find and fix that bug.\r\n\r\nRegarding projection: yes, EVF handles projection. You can ask for writers for all your columns, EVF gives you a \"dummy\" writer for those that are not projected. While top-level columns can be handled by a plugin easily (just set some flags, say), nested columns are very hard to implement in the plugin. EVF provides a uniform way to handle projection at all levels. And, for top level arrays such as `column`, EVF also handles per-element projection.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the only difference between EVF-based projection and roll-you-own is that, with EVF, the easiest path is to read the data, give it to the column writer, and let the column writer throw it away. Works well for sequential formats such as JSON and CSV.\r\n\r\nIf your format is random-access (you have to request each column, as in Parquet), then it is better to ask if the column is projected. But, if your data structure is nested, you have to do this at each level.\r\n\r\nSo, with that explanation out of the way, what about EVF projection is not working the way roll-your-own did? Let's figure that out and fix it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/585341741/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/585347032","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1978#issuecomment-585347032","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1978","id":585347032,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NTM0NzAzMg==","user":{"login":"cgivre","id":5513150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTMxNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5513150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre","html_url":"https://github.com/cgivre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-12T18:20:08Z","updated_at":"2020-02-12T18:20:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@paul-rogers \r\nHere's what's happening:\r\n```\r\napache drill> select *\r\n2..semicolon> from dfs.test.`eFitOut.h5`;\r\nError: RESOURCE ERROR: One or more nodes ran out of memory while executing the query.\r\n\r\nA single column value is larger than the maximum allowed size of 16 MB\r\nFragment 0:0\r\n\r\n[Error Id: 1d3f37ca-e7e3-48f5-9c7d-cb24bd494a67 on localhost:31010] (state=,code=0)\r\n```\r\nWhen I dug into this, I found that it was one of the dataset columns that has a single-cell value greater than 16GB.  This PR basically disables the reader from attempting to retrieve the datasets and then we avoid the whole issue.  \r\n\r\nWhat made me do this also is even if you only select other columns, you still get the error: \r\n```\r\napache drill> select path, data_type\r\n2..semicolon> from dfs.test.`eFitOut.h5`;\r\nError: RESOURCE ERROR: One or more nodes ran out of memory while executing the query.\r\n\r\nA single column value is larger than the maximum allowed size of 16 MB\r\nFragment 0:0\r\n\r\n[Error Id: 1af14cb0-9bce-488a-9d2d-aca5736670e3 on localhost:31010] (state=,code=0)\r\napache drill>\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo to conclude:\r\n1.

thanks for the stack traces. One of the annoying aspects of Drill errors are the first two chunks of traces: they will always be the same as they are on the client side.\r\n\r\nThe 16MB error is basically saying that we are writing more than 16MB for a single column in a single row. This is generally Not a Good Thing.\r\n\r\nI guess I'm surprised that you are able to get that error, however. You said you are writing `INT` values. A batch can have at most 32K values. 32K * 4 = 128K. If you have `BIGINT`, it is 256K. The same is true if you write a `DOUBLE`.\r\n\r\nLooks like your code may be writing an array given the \"doubleMatrixHelper\" name. If so, then you can get to 16 MB if you write a square matrix with more than sqrt(16M/8) ~= 1400 elements. Are you?\r\n\r\nThe problem with such large arrays are several. First, clients can't consume them; they have to be flattened. You will get 16M / 8 = 2M rows as a result. Second, allocating buffers larger than 16 MB will fragment memory.\r\n\r\nWe can provide an option to disable the 16MB limit. But, this is using a table saw without the guard: it will work some times, will cause mayhem other times. Does not help with the other issue: that an xDBC client can't really consume that volume of data.\r\n\r\nWhat is the use case here to a) show such large volumes of data in a schema view, and b) retrieve that volume of data even in a data query?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/585540050/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/585540955","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1978#issuecomment-585540955","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1978","id":585540955,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NTU0MDk1NQ==","user":{"login":"cgivre","id":5513150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTMxNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5513150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre","html_url":"https://github.com/cgivre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-13T04:10:43Z","updated_at":"2020-02-13T04:10:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@paul-rogers \r\nI don't really think it's useful to return that much data and that was why I added the config option to disable it.

Sigh.\r\n\r\nWorking around a data size limitation is not a good use for a plugin config option. The user would need a different config for each file.\r\n\r\nCan you, instead, support some special column that is the preview? Don't include the preview column in SELECT *. (I think there is an EVF trick for that, I'll have to refresh my memory. I think I added it for one of your other plugins.)

Drill is SQL-based; clients work best when a column has a specific type. On the other hand, if HDF5 is a file system, and we want to preview files, each file may have a different kind of data: records in one, strings in another, a matrix in a third. If we try to write each of these into a \"preview\" column, not only do we have a size issue, we also have a type issue: all of these examples are different types.\r\n\r\nOn your laptop, the OS gives you a preview of each file. The common denominator is the graphic tile which might be a tiny version of an image or a video frame, might be an app icon, or whatever. Point is, the OS converts all the many file types into a common format: the preview tile.\r\n\r\nIf the \"metadata\" view scans all files, the preview can be huge (the entire HDF5 content, perhaps.) A preview should be small. Rendering a tile may not be super helpful. But, perhaps a brief text representation. For your bit column, maybe: \"[[123456.78, 98745.43, ...\".\r\n\r\nYour proposed solution of using HDF5-provided metadata is also good, it makes your metadata query more like an \"ls -l\" equivalent.

It is why we can have plugins, workspaces, etc. The challenge is to provide some way for a format plugin to influence the planner and say, \"hey, if you do a query against me, ask me to resolve all path elements below my file name.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, not something for this PR.

But, for web pages, we put the data in the normal places: a cookie, a page parameter (for GET) or a form field (for POST).\nDo you want to try a fix to see if you can make your solution work?\n—\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub [https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1787?email_source=notifications&amp;email_token=AACQBGLCUSQM7MGJGROLZPDRDWBBXA5CNFSM4HMJDBUKYY3PNVWWK3TUL52HS4DFVREXG43VMVBW63LNMVXHJKTDN5WW2ZLOORPWSZGOEMJEJFY#issuecomment-588399767], or unsubscribe [https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AACQBGONV2TFO5MC4GGP7SLRDWBBXANCNFSM4HMJDBUA].","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/588560808/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/588841695","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1988#issuecomment-588841695","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1988","id":588841695,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4ODg0MTY5NQ==","user":{"login":"vvysotskyi","id":20928429,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTI4NDI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20928429?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi","html_url":"https://github.com/vvysotskyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-20T09:29:40Z","updated_at":"2020-02-20T09:29:40Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The problem is that not all contributors run full tests suite before opening the pull request or rerunning it after making some changes.

That way, for example, I could help with the commit process as I used to do when at MapR. The workflow would then be:\r\n\r\n1. Ideally, run the full unit tests on the dev machine. Or, at least unit tests around the fix.\r\n2. A \"smoke test\" run on GitHub when pushing the branch.\r\n3. PR and code review.\r\n4. The full \"pre-commit\" run by a committer.\r\n5. Commit.\r\n\r\nDrill used to do batch commits on Friday. This meant that some engineer had to do the merges and run the pre-commit tests. Took time. In Impala, we each ran the equivalent of the pre-commit tests and merged our own patches after approval. Since this could be done offline (run in the evening, say), it was not as much of a time sink as the old Drill process.\r\n\r\nI suppose there are two questions. 1) Do you (or someone on the team) understand the current system well enough to set up a duplicate on, say, AWS? and, of course, 2) Where do we get funding for the AWS (or GCE) instance?
