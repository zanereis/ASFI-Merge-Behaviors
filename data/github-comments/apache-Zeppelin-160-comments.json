\r\nOh, I didn't see the code and commented above...😅 \r\nBut I found you missed something!\r\n\r\nThe original code has an error because it always gets `lastRunningUnixTime` from the last

Math.max(getUnixTimeLastRunParagraph(paragraph), lastRunningUnixTime);\r\n```\r\nThen, `lastRunningUnixTime` will be the latest running time among the paragraphs.\r\n\r\nIt will be appreciated if you

So, it is as if the feature is off by default, and each interpreter can opt in by adding a few lines of code to its overridden version of `interpret(...)` for calling the command interpolating function [SparkSqlInterpreter.interpolateVariable(...)](https://github.com/sanjaydasgupta/zeppelin/blob/906b698187bf5d4f358cb1263bdb15bfb0b286f4/spark/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/spark/SparkSqlInterpreter.java#L92). \r\n\r\nIn the long run (when more interpreters use this feature), the interpolating function [SparkSqlInterpreter.interpolateVariable(...)](https://github.com/sanjaydasgupta/zeppelin/blob/906b698187bf5d4f358cb1263bdb15bfb0b286f4/spark/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/spark/SparkSqlInterpreter.java#L92) could be moved up into `Interpreter.java`, and the command interpolation logic could be applied automatically -- conditionally upon the return value of a function like [Interpreter. getFormType()](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/zeppelin-interpreter/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/interpreter/Interpreter.java#L102).\r\n\r\nMy feeling is that fairly extensive refactoring affecting all the existing interpreter classes will be needed when the changes in the previous paragraph are made.

The resulting code is elegant and intuitive, but could be a stumbling block for those not familiar with Scala. Please let me know if it is ok to add a bit of Scala in this way.\r\n\r\nAfter thinking hard about the implications (to other interpreters) of assumptions we make now about the legal forms of the use of '{' and '}', I tried to seek inspiration from Jupyter's implementation of a similar feature (when spawning a shell command using !). The following clear cases exist:\r\n\r\n1) any `{varname}` (formed with exactly one '{' and '}') is interpolated into the command -- only if `varname` is defined. If `varname` is not defined, no error is reported, and the pattern is left as is -- to be handled by the spawned shell command.\r\n\r\n2) any `{{something}}` (formed with exactly two '{' and '}' characters) is interpolated as `{something}`. There is no change in this behavior even when `something` has a defined value.\r\n\r\n3) All other occurrences of '{' and '}' (singly or in groups) are treated as ordinary characters, and passed through unchanged to the underlying shell command.\r\n\r\nConsidering all the different usages of '{' and '}' that there might be in many different interpreters (to which we extend this feature progressively), it may be reasonable to follow something like the above convention from Jupyter. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know your views on these.

for the suggestions @felixcheung \r\n\r\nI was not able to find more documentation on Jupyter's feature, but tried it with many different variants. There are some behaviors that had not been found earlier, so I have added it to the implementation and the documentation. I also gave the documentation section a more distinctive title.\r\n\r\nOne of the things I learned about Jupyter's implementation is that it never intercepts an error case. All command strings are passed through to the underlying command -- with or without interpolation. Any use of '{' and/or '}' that does not appear to be part of a well-formed _pattern_ causes Jupyter to pass on the entire command string unchanged. This happens even when the command string contains other patterns that are well-formed, and could be interpolated.\r\n\r\nSo, there is now no need to return a status value to indicate the success/failure of the interpolation. The string returned by the interpolation function is generated by emulating Jupyter's behavior in the same situation.\r\n\r\nI have also moved the interpolation function into the superclass  [Interpreter.java](https://github.com/sanjaydasgupta/zeppelin/commit/9e75333ff7ef9c27678382c598b524eafc6191f7#diff-f9d22f7302ae356454cdcc637942856fR493) to enable it to be shared and used by other interpreters too. This follows a suggestion from @Leemoonsoo earlier in the PR. My implementation of this feature for the Shell interpreter is also ready, and I will submit a PR once this one is done.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/323586516/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/323589612","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2539#issuecomment-323589612","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2539","id":323589612,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMzU4OTYxMg==","user":{"login":"da-liii","id":1267865,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjc4NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1267865?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/da-liii","html_url":"https://github.com/da-liii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/da-liii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/da-liii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/da-liii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/da-liii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/da-liii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/da-liii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/da-liii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/da-liii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/da-liii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-20T14:47:13Z","updated_at":"2017-08-20T14:47:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@zjffdu \r\n\r\nYour solution didn't solve the problem in the quoted:\r\n\r\n`The critical part is that files under conf/ such as shiro.ini is part of the docker image and should be immutable.`\r\n\r\nImaging the following use case, I have a base docker image, and two other end-point docker images. The base docker image consists of jars and a default configuration. And the end-point docker images just config the base image, that means for example image0 use CAS auth in `shiro.ini` and image1 use LDAP in `shiro.ini`. The immutable part of a deployment identifies a docker image. That is the charming part of docker. We should not modify the conf files in a mounted volume. If you keep this files in a mounted volume,  you will never correctly start up zeppelin with ill configurations.\r\n\r\nThis is my understanding of dockerization.

two cents \r\n\r\n> One of the things I learned about Jupyter's implementation is that it never intercepts an error case\r\n\r\nI personally not necessarily like how this piece is implemented in Jupyter.. that an error can be silently ignored, and in case of an error whole {.. } block is returned unchanged. \r\n\r\nShould we have a Zeppelin option that controls this behavior?\r\n1. Option 1 if used - it'll completely follow Jupyter bahavior (no error, {..} block return unchanged).\r\n2. Option 2 - fail explicitly if variable in curly braces can't be found.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I think most of folks may actually prefer option 1, as introduction of { .. } may be a breaking change for some notebooks' code. So I think Option 1 should be default.\r\n\r\n> This follows a suggestion from @Leemoonsoo earlier in the PR. My implementation of this feature for the Shell interpreter is also ready, and I will submit a PR once this one is done.\r\n\r\nThat's great. Thanks for working on this.
