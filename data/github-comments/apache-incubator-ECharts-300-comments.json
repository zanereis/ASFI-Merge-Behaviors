The `time` type axis doesn't take number arrays because it's continuous. Only `category` typed axis can take number arrays as value.\r\n\r\nWell, if I am not getting it wrong, the `time` axis does take number arrays, when the number array is set in the first column of `series.data`? The first chart in the question would be an example, it takes a transposed 2-dim array from x & y as input: \r\n```\r\ndata = [\r\n    [1594830880000, 1],\r\n    [1594830880000+200, 5],\r\n    [1594830880000+400, 2],\r\n    [1594830880000+600, 3],\r\n    [1594830880000+800, 7],\r\n    [1594830880000+1000, 9]\r\n]\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/659156753/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/659186157","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/12221#issuecomment-659186157","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/12221","id":659186157,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1OTE4NjE1Nw==","user":{"login":"WenBinWu","id":6357200,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNTcyMDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6357200?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WenBinWu","html_url":"https://github.com/WenBinWu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WenBinWu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WenBinWu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WenBinWu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WenBinWu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WenBinWu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WenBinWu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WenBinWu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WenBinWu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WenBinWu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-16T06:23:22Z","updated_at":"2020-07-16T06:29:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Add some code in function of incrementalRender may fix this issue.\r\n`\r\nincrementalRender: function (params, customSeries, ecModel, api, payload) {\r\n    var data = customSeries.getData();\r\n        var renderItem = makeRenderItem(customSeries, data, ecModel, api);\r\n        function setIncrementalAndHoverLayer(el) {\r\n            if (!el.isGroup) {\r\n                el.incremental = true;\r\n                el.useHoverLayer = true;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        for (var idx = params.start;
