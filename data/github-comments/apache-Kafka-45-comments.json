A list of FailureCauses or something? The full stack trace requires intermediate exception types + messages to make much sense, right?\n\nI agree that as it is now, different types of errors could be difficult to diagnose. Since we only keep the root cause, the source of some exceptions may nor may not be clear (e.g. if a JDBC gets a SQLException that is too generic, it might be difficult to figure out what triggered it). In contrast, only reporting the top-level exception without including any messages from causes may leave things too generic (e.g. ConnectException with a generic message).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/187958641/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/187959742","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/872#issuecomment-187959742","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/872","id":187959742,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4Nzk1OTc0Mg==","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-23T23:17:00Z","updated_at":"2016-02-23T23:17:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@gwenshap The main motivation is to logically separate aggregation for stream (which is always by key) and for table (which you specify the aggregation key), and the name of \"selector\" comes from \"groupBy\" syntax that we plan to extract from KTable.

Minor comments, but this looks good. Since we're adding the finer granularity version, I think it's really worth thinking through whether the coarser-grained version is still necessary. We kept the interfaces marked unstable so we could change it. At a minimum, if we don't think any source connectors will get value from it given the finer grained version, we could at least mark it deprecated now and drop it in a release or two. I think you now have the most experience with source connectors that need this callback, so your input on whether it's still useful would be much appreciated :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/187977554/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/187988576","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/955#issuecomment-187988576","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/955","id":187988576,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4Nzk4ODU3Ng==","user":{"login":"christian-posta","id":53201,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53201?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/christian-posta","html_url":"https://github.com/christian-posta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christian-posta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christian-posta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christian-posta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christian-posta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christian-posta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christian-posta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christian-posta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christian-posta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christian-posta/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-24T00:37:22Z","updated_at":"2016-02-24T00:37:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@gwenshap shall I open another JIRA for the patch for the windows batch files?

@miguno This patch is ready for review now:\n\n1) I maintained the original approach of separating windowed aggregation with non-windowed aggregation, since while re-implementing it as a special case I realized the return type difference (KTable<Windowed> and KTable) is quite tricky to handle. Hence stay as is, which admittedly adds more LOC.\n\n2) Add the serializer to console consumer to allow it print correct formatted data (this is used in the demo).\n\n3) Make all the 5 example codes runnable, step-by-step guidance:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1OUPROg1F_xVp65nfBFPcmg-f2Vd23heZgm9BUwsg5uA/edit?usp=sharing\n\n4) Add a Json timestamp extractor to extract the timestamp field as the event time, this is to guarantee the user profile data is always processed before the pageview data in the `org.apache.kafka.streams.examples.pageview` examples.\n\n5) Fix a bunch of issues while making the demo code runnable. One of the major ones is to introduce a `connectProcessors` call for unite processors in stream-table left join.
