In theory, there is a tiny overhead during serialization, but it is small, and often more than compensated by storage savings so that the end result is faster overall serialization. In the worst case, run compression brings little storage benefit and slightly lower performance, but there should be many cases where you have a large net win. We recommend it as the default.\n\nAs for compatibility problems...   I think that what you are saying is correct...\n\n> RLE containers are not readable by pre 0.5 versions of roaring.\n\n... but I am not sure there is a problem.\n\nRoaring is backward compatible. So the library will happily load bitmaps without run compression. The older versions of the library will balk at bitmaps with run compression, but then why would it ever have to read them? It would only be a problem if someone upgraded Druid, rewrote the indexes, and then downgraded Druid... then you'd get (clean) exceptions (something about an unrecognized cookie).\n\nIf this ever happened and you wanted to make you index \"go back in time\", that is, undo the added compression, the Roaring API got you covered if you ever want to support this... https://github.com/RoaringBitmap/RoaringBitmap/blob/master/src/main/java/org/roaringbitmap/buffer/MutableRoaringBitmap.java#L1194\n\nPlease note that Roaring uses header cookies. This comes at a tiny cost storage-wise, but it has the benefit that the Roaring bitmaps are \"self described\". It limits the risk regarding data corruption. That is, you don't get Roaring trying to load and interpret garbage... instead, it balks after reading one word and throws up an exception which you can quickly interpret.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/231173468/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/231175145","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/3168#issuecomment-231175145","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3168","id":231175145,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMTE3NTE0NQ==","user":{"login":"rajk-tetration","id":19398280,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Mzk4Mjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19398280?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajk-tetration","html_url":"https://github.com/rajk-tetration","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajk-tetration/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajk-tetration/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajk-tetration/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajk-tetration/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajk-tetration/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajk-tetration/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajk-tetration/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajk-tetration/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajk-tetration/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-07T19:00:54Z","updated_at":"2016-07-07T19:01:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@gianm I'm not really sure what `getCacheKey` is, is it just a unique identifier for this query?
