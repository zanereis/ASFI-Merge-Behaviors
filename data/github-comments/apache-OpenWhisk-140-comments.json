It requires a component name which is provided via config. For example Invoker provides it like below \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/blob/79e72e641703b4138cc58bc6bf0d5863a8fe6919/core/invoker/src/main/resources/application.conf#L71-L74\r\n\r\nAnd similarly Controller provides it in its config. So each new module would need to provide this. Other option can be that we provide a default value in common reference.conf \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/blob/f593de8614cf51c84ed7e78b27e93f64cda72c75/common/scala/src/main/resources/application.conf#L207-L219\r\n\r\nThe other module can choose to override it if needed. \r\n\r\nSo we can either keep current fix or do above change.
