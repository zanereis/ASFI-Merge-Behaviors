And of course `/activations/namespace-name/package-name` and  `/activations/namespace-name/package-name/action-name` for activation in some other namespace and package assuming entitled

the container promotes any rejected value `V` to `{ error: V }`, since having an `error` field in an activation is the signal for, well, errors.\r\n\r\nSo `Promise.reject(\"oh no\")` turns into `{ error: \"oh no\" }`, `Promise.reject({ reason: \"panic\" })` turns into `{ error: { reason: \"panic\" }}` etc.\r\n\r\nThere is the additional catch that if `V` is `undefined` (or in general false-y), it is replaced by `{}`. This is to address #1562, where the issue was that `{ error: undefined }` is the same as `{}`, which doesn't communicate that there was an error.\r\n\r\nOne proposal is that if `V` is somehow not JSON-serializable, we should fall back to what we do for exceptions, i.e. returning ```{ error: `An error has occured: $V` } ```. This would be consistent.\r\n\r\nNow, an additional option is to treat instances of `Error` as special cases, and just do `{ error: V.message }` (additionally logging the stack trace), both for exceptions and rejected promises.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/266859511/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/266863405","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/1469#issuecomment-266863405","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1469","id":266863405,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2Njg2MzQwNQ==","user":{"login":"dubee","id":11520887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIwODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11520887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee","html_url":"https://github.com/dubee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-13T21:12:22Z","updated_at":"2016-12-13T21:12:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"PG2 773.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/266863405/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/266863471","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/1469#issuecomment-266863471","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1469","id":266863471,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2Njg2MzQ3MQ==","user":{"login":"dubee","id":11520887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIwODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11520887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee","html_url":"https://github.com/dubee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-13T21:12:39Z","updated_at":"2016-12-13T21:12:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@rabbah, anything else on this one?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/266863471/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/266864024","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/1603#issuecomment-266864024","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1603","id":266864024,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2Njg2NDAyNA==","user":{"login":"perryibm","id":14339749,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzM5NzQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14339749?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/perryibm","html_url":"https://github.com/perryibm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perryibm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perryibm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perryibm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perryibm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perryibm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perryibm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perryibm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perryibm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perryibm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-13T21:14:40Z","updated_at":"2016-12-13T21:14:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM.
