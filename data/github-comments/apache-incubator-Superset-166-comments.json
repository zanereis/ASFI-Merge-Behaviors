I got a user saying that their CSV export today was just 1k rows and I was confused as I thought the limit was much higher like 1M for CSVs. I got confused because I read the code and thought \"mmh I thought there was 2 different settings for this...\" but couldn't find evidence of that since this PR had changed that.\r\n\r\nSo when is `async` mode we should apply the `SQL_MAX_ROW` limit (1M by default) to send to the results backend, so that the `csv/` endpoint can hit that in async mode. The `results/` endpoint in async mode (reading from the results backend) should read only the first `DISPLAY_SQL_MAX_ROW` rows only and return that to prevent the UI from crashing. I think this was all working prior to this PR.\r\n\r\nIn non-async mode, we should apply `DISPLAY_SQL_MAX_ROW` on the `sql_json/` endpoint, and apply no limit o the `csv/` endpoint. I think this was not working before, we would just return `SQL_MAX_ROW` and crash the browser. This didn't happen much at Lyft and Airbnb since we run most big databases in async mode.\r\n\r\nSorry this is all a bit confusing and clearly needs to be documented better. We also need to allow the user to know what is happening here and maybe allow them to change their limits, though we shouldn't let them crash their browser too easily.\r\n\r\n@timifasubaa @villebro ^^^","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/417187969/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/417189578","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/5413#issuecomment-417189578","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/5413","id":417189578,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNzE4OTU3OA==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-30T04:54:59Z","updated_at":"2018-08-30T04:55:10Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I missed this a while back, but how do we allow for users to do largish CSV extracts when in async mode? @timifasubaa @john-bodley ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/417189578/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/417189694","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/5392#issuecomment-417189694","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/5392","id":417189694,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNzE4OTY5NA==","user":{"login":"villebro","id":33317356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzE3MzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33317356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro","html_url":"https://github.com/villebro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-30T04:55:53Z","updated_at":"2018-08-30T04:55:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@mistercrunch Ok that makes sense.

It would make it easier to test if email settings work correctly, and also check if the email report renders properly. Especially given the fact that the schedule is only updated hourly, testing what a new scheduled report looks like can be a pain without this feature.\r\n- Another feature that would be valuable in the UI (not for this release, but later): Custom resolution (if a report looks better in some resolution other than that defined in `superset_config.py`), \r\n- Slightly outside the scope of this PR, but `EMAIL_NOTIFICATIONS` is defined twice in `config.py`, and is slightly misleading for the dry run feature (if I understood the code correctly, emails are not sent unless `EMAIL_NOTIFICATIONS` is set to True). I would perhaps add a specific debugging flag for email schedules that controls dry run that would be called `SCHEDULED_EMAIL_DEBUG_MODE` or something similar, as it's not directly related to regular email notifications.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/417850641/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/417850670","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/4588#issuecomment-417850670","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/4588","id":417850670,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNzg1MDY3MA==","user":{"login":"rumbin","id":1220356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjAzNTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1220356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rumbin","html_url":"https://github.com/rumbin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rumbin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rumbin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rumbin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rumbin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rumbin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rumbin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rumbin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rumbin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rumbin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-01T10:56:10Z","updated_at":"2018-09-01T10:56:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@CoryChaplin you should already be able to achieve this by using the warm_up_cache endpoint.

Alternatively, bringing up a modal that asks which addresses to send to that defaults to the recipients in the schedule would probably be optimal. Personally I would prefer to see this already be part of the current PR, as it is the natural first step of creating an email schedule: first test, then schedule. But if it is a lot of extra work then probably ok to wait for extra PR.\r\n- custom resolution in separate PR for sure.\r\n- One final comment is regarding the lack of transparency regarding when the schedule is updated. I think the optimal user experience would be for the schedule to be updated every time a schedule is updated (perhaps even a `config.py` setting for choosing to update hourly or at every update), but if this is difficult to achieve then a small note somewhere near the cron schedule is defined is probably fine.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, I think the feature is excellent and the code clean (apart from the selenium retries which aren't your fault). We will be gradually deploying this into production shortly, so if we have any problems I will be sure to let you know!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/418004061/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/418053246","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/5792#issuecomment-418053246","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/5792","id":418053246,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxODA1MzI0Ng==","user":{"login":"vnnw","id":4979571,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Nzk1NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4979571?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnnw","html_url":"https://github.com/vnnw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnnw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnnw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnnw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnnw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnnw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnnw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnnw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnnw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnnw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-03T09:15:03Z","updated_at":"2018-09-03T09:15:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"you may try to modify   https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/8a4b1b7c25a8234ac1641add38645a08fb338dd1/superset/views/core.py#L2493 if you know Flask.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/418053246/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/418206123","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/5755#issuecomment-418206123","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/5755","id":418206123,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxODIwNjEyMw==","user":{"login":"graceguo-supercat","id":27990562,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3OTkwNTYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27990562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat","html_url":"https://github.com/graceguo-supercat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-03T23:45:04Z","updated_at":"2018-09-03T23:45:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @Geetha-LMI for url parameters for dashboard, can you elaborate a little bit, what's input and expected results?
