Let me explain what we currently see, and why the proposed change as part of my explanation.\n\nThe server hands out 64 bit IDs based on an AtomicLong it stores internally.  This value is initialized at startup to the current system time and is monotonically increased with each request.  What we see today is that the ID is very strongly correlated to system time at startup, but over time the ID values begin to trail very substantially from the system clock.  This is because the requests don't come in with the frequency of time clicks.\n\nThe proposed change is to try to periodically refresh the internal ID based on the current system time so that it stays closer to the system time.  This would have the observable effect of the returned IDs making periodic leaps FORWARD, not backward.\n\nThe same would be true of IDs following a system shutdown.  The new system time is ahead of the previous system time or ID and could never go backwards... unless...\n\nUnless the system clocks are reset.  If the system clocks are reset, then yes the IDs could go backwards and this would have the same effect as setting the clocks backwards today.  It would depend on many variables - how far back did the time get set, what was the latest time used in the database, etc.  In practice I don't think this is very likely to affect anyone.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/179368039/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/179381349","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/305#issuecomment-179381349","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/305","id":179381349,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3OTM4MTM0OQ==","user":{"login":"Traf-Jenkins","id":12548626,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQ4NjI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12548626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/Traf-Jenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-03T18:07:29Z","updated_at":"2016-02-03T18:07:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Test Passed.  https://jenkins.esgyn.com/job/Check-PR-master/407/\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/179381349/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/179420865","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/304#issuecomment-179420865","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/304","id":179420865,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3OTQyMDg2NQ==","user":{"login":"DaveBirdsall","id":5659628,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk2Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5659628?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveBirdsall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-03T19:33:51Z","updated_at":"2016-02-03T19:33:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Code changes look good to me.
