Furthermore, the plan was to introduce a runtime mode which would prevent the instantiation of JobConf and alike to reduce the required classes to very few APIs.

this is a good start - couple of comments though:\n\n1) Binary Block Writer: The method writePartitionedBinaryBlockFrameToHDFS is not required and can be removed. Also please put a comment in there that this write uses fixed size blocks with block-encoded keys. In the future, we might change that, especially the keys (e.g., starting offset).\n2) CSV File Merge: the methods  mergeCSVPartFiles and addHeaderToCSV work on bytes. Hence there is no need to replicate them here for frames.\n3) Null Checks: Keep in mind that frames might contain sparse cells (w/ null objects). You need to handle this when trying to convert them to strings. Also, for textcell, sparse cells should not be materialized into the output (it's a sparse format).\n4) String Conversions: The cast to string for CSV and textcell would crash for any schema other than ValueType.STRING.

Additionally, the stacktrace information isn't included since this information is distracting and not useful for a user trying to fix parse errors in the DML.\n\nThis PR also makes this information avaible via ParseException so that it is available at higher levels of the call stack, which can help when handling parse situations in a notebook, for example.\n\nThis PR also contains other fixes and updates.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/206626651/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/206658260","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/105#issuecomment-206658260","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/105","id":206658260,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNjY1ODI2MA==","user":{"login":"gweidner","id":12058879,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4ODc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058879?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner","html_url":"https://github.com/gweidner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-07T02:12:31Z","updated_at":"2016-04-07T02:12:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"All tests passed in [PR build 240](https://sparktc.ibmcloud.com/jenkins/job/SystemML-PullRequestBuilder/240/).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/206658260/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/206940135","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/105#issuecomment-206940135","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/105","id":206940135,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNjk0MDEzNQ==","user":{"login":"gweidner","id":12058879,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4ODc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058879?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner","html_url":"https://github.com/gweidner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-07T14:53:08Z","updated_at":"2016-04-07T14:53:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"All tests also passed in [OnDemand build 134](https://sparktc.ibmcloud.com/jenkins/job/SystemML-OnDemand/134/) which was rerun since previous [OnDemand build 133](https://sparktc.ibmcloud.com/jenkins/job/SystemML-OnDemand/133/) showed 1 failure in  org.apache.sysml.test.integration.applications.pydml.L2SVMPyDMLTest.\n\nNote pre-existing behavior sets namespace to '.defaultNS' in CommonSyntacticValidator.getQualifiedNames for any function call that does not specify namespace.

In general, I think it would be useful to consistently change the number of max iterations to something like 10.

For the maximum number of iterations please have a look at the arguments 'maxiter' and 'moi'/'mii'. That reminds me, it would be also useful to create consistency between the names of these arguments across all dml scripts.

Please, also delete the related MergeBlocksFunction and mergeByKey primitives.\n4) Blocksize: Again, we want to create variable size blocks at the end of partitions, so we cannot use UtilFunctions.computeBlockSize which would always give you 1k, even at the end of partitions.\n5) Tests: Please factor out your new testcases into a separate converter test class as it has nothing to do with frame read/write. Given this refactoring you could also drop the execution type as it is misleading because these are component tests not integration tests on dml script level.  \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/209245125/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/209286647","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/113#issuecomment-209286647","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/113","id":209286647,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwOTI4NjY0Nw==","user":{"login":"asurve","id":13441665,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDQxNjY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13441665?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asurve","html_url":"https://github.com/asurve","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asurve/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asurve/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asurve/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asurve/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asurve/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asurve/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asurve/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asurve/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asurve/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-13T07:45:33Z","updated_at":"2016-04-13T07:45:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I have addressed the changes.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/209286647/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/209295972","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/115#issuecomment-209295972","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/115","id":209295972,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwOTI5NTk3Mg==","user":{"login":"akchinSTC","id":13340013,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzQwMDEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13340013?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC","html_url":"https://github.com/akchinSTC","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-13T08:13:31Z","updated_at":"2016-04-13T08:13:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Can an Admin verify this patch?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/209295972/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/209327280","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/115#issuecomment-209327280","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/115","id":209327280,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwOTMyNzI4MA==","user":{"login":"shirisht","id":13215072,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjE1MDcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13215072?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shirisht","html_url":"https://github.com/shirisht","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shirisht/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shirisht/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shirisht/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shirisht/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shirisht/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shirisht/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shirisht/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shirisht/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shirisht/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-13T09:19:54Z","updated_at":"2016-04-13T09:19:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Most changes are cleanups and cosmetic.
