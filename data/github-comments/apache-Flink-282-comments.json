To be honest, I still have two concerns in `SpillingAdaptiveSpanningRecordDeserializer`.\r\n\r\n1. We add more extra codes for debugging exceptions in main process especially in reading `nonSpanningWrapper`, that would make readable not very well for a little complicated logic, especially for the long `throwDeserializationError` parameters. No matter reading `nonSpanningWrapper` or `spanningWrapper`, if they can internally check whether read more or less as expected, it can make main logics more clearly.\r\n\r\n2. For reading `spanningWrapper` process, we do not handle the two exceptions together as reading previous `nonSpanningWrapper`. Left checking less-consumed exception in the process of `moveRemainderToNonSpanningDeserializer`. If we can handle both less-consumed and more-consumed in this process `target.read(this.spanningWrapper.getInputView())`, it may seem better. But I know it seems difficult to do that.\r\n\r\nI agree that the added checking information is useful for debugging, and I have not thought of other ways to better solve above concerns, so I am willing to accept the current changes. :) \r\n\r\nOnly left one additional comment for duplicate tests.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/440208800/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/440209346","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/7110#issuecomment-440209346","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/7110","id":440209346,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MDIwOTM0Ng==","user":{"login":"dianfu","id":5466492,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjY0OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5466492?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu","html_url":"https://github.com/dianfu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-20T09:45:50Z","updated_at":"2018-11-20T09:46:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@dawidwys @sunjincheng121 Thanks a lot for your review comments.

True, if we could do this in `SpanningWrapper` or `NonSpanningWrapper`/its created input view, it would be better to grasp. However, these work on a byte level and are called by the user's de/serializer. We don't know when the user has finished reading (for checking whether too few bytes have been consumed). I could hack some `finishRecordDeserialization()` method in but this would also miss a few things we are adding now: record length and how many bytes have been read after the record length. We could hack these in as well but would also have to wrap any exception in its read methods to throw ours instead (for reading too many bytes).\r\n-> I do agree that this whole deserialization code should eventually be simplified, but not as part of this PR.\r\n2. I could actually move the error-checking code up into `SpillingAdaptiveSpanningRecordDeserializer#getNextRecord()` as well. I think, it makes sense to have it together in one place -
