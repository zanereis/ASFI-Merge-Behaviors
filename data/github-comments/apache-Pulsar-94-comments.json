so far we are able to keep function metadata separate from broker's cluster metadata by storing them into function itself.

this is not just about not being able to read the event, but also about the latency (how fast it can query the data). current assumption is assuming there are are events \"eventually\" arrive and advance the LAC, which will significantly delay the messages being visible to users if the events are delayed. so I think we still need to enable explicit write lac on broker, so the lac will be advanced within a SLA. \r\n\r\nThe feature is already in bookkeeper. It is just a matter to enable it and make sure it is working as expected. If pulsar broker doesn't want this feature to be turned on by default, we can make it configurable and turned off by default. If people want this feature, they can turn it on. I don't think we should just ignore this fact and try to explain to people who don't really understand how the underlying stuff works.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/473177000/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/473179814","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/3828#issuecomment-473179814","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/3828","id":473179814,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MzE3OTgxNA==","user":{"login":"jerrypeng","id":3613359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTMzNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3613359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng","html_url":"https://github.com/jerrypeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-15T07:00:11Z","updated_at":"2019-03-15T07:00:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@sijie I totally agree we should add something like this.
