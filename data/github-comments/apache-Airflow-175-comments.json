Preferably you run the tests against your own Travis instance first, instead of using the Apache Travis. The hours of Apache Travis are paid, and on your own fork is for free :-)\r\n\r\nI don't see any changes in the tests itself. Maybe it would be nice to add a test like: Run a dag with a RedisSensor, and make sure that it will pass. So we have some actual code which communicates with Travis (and therefore also uses the RedisHook).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/439705915/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/439706018","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4134#issuecomment-439706018","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4134","id":439706018,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzOTcwNjAxOA==","user":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-18T16:34:52Z","updated_at":"2018-11-18T16:34:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bkvarda Can you rebase on master as well?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/439706018/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/439707713","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4207#issuecomment-439707713","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4207","id":439707713,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzOTcwNzcxMw==","user":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-18T16:56:50Z","updated_at":"2018-11-18T16:56:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Please consult with https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/4090 before you do any duplicate work :-)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/439707713/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/439708132","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4207#issuecomment-439708132","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4207","id":439708132,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzOTcwODEzMg==","user":{"login":"jmcarp","id":1633460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzM0NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1633460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp","html_url":"https://github.com/jmcarp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-18T17:02:47Z","updated_at":"2018-11-18T17:02:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Fokko: sorry, I didn't realize this was a paid travis account.
