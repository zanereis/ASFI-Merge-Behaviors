@alex2wong . The grid top is a fixed height by default. It's for the space of legend, title, toolbox or other components. Currently, this is not automatically layout. You can change the top with the option [grid.top](https://echarts.apache.org/en/option.html#grid.top). It can be fixed height or a percent value.\r\n\r\nAbout the issue @CeleKing asked. The container height is too small and it caused the grid height to a negative value. \r\n\r\nPerhaps we can limit the value to zero to avoid confusing. Of course, the best solution is adding automatically layout to utilize the space as much as possible.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/533374361/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/533374629","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/11284#issuecomment-533374629","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/11284","id":533374629,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMzM3NDYyOQ==","user":{"login":"author-fuyf","id":31279101,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjc5MTAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31279101?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/author-fuyf","html_url":"https://github.com/author-fuyf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/author-fuyf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/author-fuyf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/author-fuyf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/author-fuyf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/author-fuyf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/author-fuyf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/author-fuyf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/author-fuyf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/author-fuyf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-20T02:11:28Z","updated_at":"2019-09-20T02:11:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@Ovilia

It is really not easy to autolayout all possible elements, and make them not overlap.. I compare same container height/width in chart.js which implement the autolayout among title/legend and grid itself, though in extremely small container height it still result in short grid.\r\n\r\nAs for tech detail, I can only come up with a simple idea right now, in **getLayoutRect** function, we get legend/title/toolbox's position and visibility then adjust the grid top/bottom. For instance, cut down grid top to zero or half of original value. But we can NOT fit all cases, since there are so many option can be configured..\r\n\r\nmaybe some thing like this: \r\n```\r\n// layout ajustment NOT work when top/bottom typed number.\r\n            switch (legend && (legend.top || legend.bottom)\r\n                || title && (title.top || title.bottom)\r\n                || toolbox && (toolbox.top || toolbox.bottom)) {\r\n                case 'top':\r\n                    bottom = bottom / 2;\r\n                    break;\r\n                case 'bottom':\r\n                    // Elements only at bottom, adjust grid top.\r\n                    top = top / 2;\r\n                    break;\r\n                default:\r\n                    top = top / 2;\r\n                    bottom = bottom / 2;\r\n            }\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr as you said, just set the default grid Top as 0, or 10%. then reset it a bigger value if found Elements at bottom/top.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/533868552/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/533910896","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/11298#issuecomment-533910896","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/11298","id":533910896,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMzkxMDg5Ng==","user":{"login":"echarts-bot[bot]","id":45089189,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDUwODkxODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/20872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/echarts-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-22T19:33:30Z","updated_at":"2019-09-22T19:33:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi!
