The bug that you described in the above comments was due (it seems) to a change I made in nullable vector to make the `value` vector carry the correct metadata. This caused problems when we \"cloned\" that vector. My first fix attempted to fix that secondary issue (the cloning issue). After strong push-back from @sohami, I decided we can't afford to fix the metadata inconsistency (at least not by someone such as myself that is getting rusty on the code.)\r\n\r\nSo, instead, I backed out the metadata change, which should fix the vector clone issue. Instead, in the result set loader code, I \"parse\" the vector type and handle the metadata inconsistency.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the tests for this PR pass. I do need someone, however, to rerun the pre-commit tests to determine if the clone issue has gone away; we have no unit tests that test that particular case.\r\n\r\nIf we can run those tests, and they pass, then perhaps we can finally commit this PR so I can add the final bit of code change in this series that we've been trying to get in for six months now...

Please see `AbstractMapVector.java:48`. The problem is that a newly created map vector references a newly created deep copy(clone) of the passed `MaterializedField` while newly created child vectors of the map vector references children of **another** instance of the `MaterializeField`. If that **other** instance is completely immutable it would not cause any problem (except that now there is no reason to create deep copy), but with your changes there was an attempt to mutate from different threads the **other** instance as that **other** instance is used to create multiple outgoing vectors. I hope that this explains what I mean when referring to **existing** bug.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/406811356/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/406906892","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1391#issuecomment-406906892","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1391","id":406906892,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNjkwNjg5Mg==","user":{"login":"sachouche","id":29960235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTYwMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29960235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachouche","html_url":"https://github.com/sachouche","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachouche/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachouche/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachouche/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachouche/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachouche/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachouche/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachouche/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachouche/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachouche/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-22T23:52:26Z","updated_at":"2018-07-22T23:52:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Ben-Zvi , thank you for the review!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/406906892/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/406929428","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1334#issuecomment-406929428","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1334","id":406929428,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNjkyOTQyOA==","user":{"login":"amansinha100","id":6034475,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMzQ0NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6034475?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100","html_url":"https://github.com/amansinha100","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-23T03:31:23Z","updated_at":"2018-07-23T03:31:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hey @weijietong,  sorry for the delay; I will send you my final comments by tomorrow.

However, as some dev list user pointed out, the test classes were not historically available to code outside the `exec` module. Perhaps Tim's recent changes fixed this so that unit test classes are available in `contrib`?\r\n\r\nIn short, the request is that we ensure that code in `contrib` can be debugged and tested the same way as code in `exec`. Else, people will have to do what I found I had to do recently: develop the code in `exec`, then, once it is done, move it to `contrib`. If I had to make changes, I had to temporarily move it back to `exec`. Let's make sure that this is no longer necessary.

This is exactly what we've discussed multiple times over the last several months.

Hopefully your `MaterializedField` refactoring will fix it.\r\n\r\nThe whole reason this PR has been stalled is due to a bug that showed up only in the pre-commit tests when @Ben-Zvi tried to commit it. I've been stuck ever since.\r\n\r\nI'm pretty much at a dead end on this PR. If the bug is pre-existing and only occurs in the private MapR pre-commit tests, then there is not much I can do to fix it.\r\n\r\nThis PR has been revised to provide a workaround for the only vector change that this PR introduced. It would be very useful to please re-run the pre-commit tests to see if the workaround corrected the issue that showed up only with this PR in the pre-commit tests.\r\n\r\nThe other, pre-existing issue would be great to fix, just not in this PR. As I've noted, I'm getting rusty on the code and have other commitments, and so it would be hard for me to fix bugs unrelated to this work. \r\n\r\nIs there a reason to hold up another trial run of this PR while waiting for a fix for the map problem?\r\n\r\nAs this is stalled, others are slowly recreating the work already completed here.

it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/409801351/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/409805900","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1414#issuecomment-409805900","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1414","id":409805900,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwOTgwNTkwMA==","user":{"login":"HanumathRao","id":5264087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNjQwODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5264087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao","html_url":"https://github.com/HanumathRao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-02T04:58:27Z","updated_at":"2018-08-02T04:58:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@sachouche

\r\nI agree the planner should have been responsible for optimally exposing the implicit & partition columns since it has all the necessary metadata. This feature was not implemented that way.. The execution layer included logic to optimize implicit column handling if the query was not a STAR_QUERY. My fix was mainly to pass the missing metadata in the case of STAR_QUERY and thus trigger the existing optimization. Our testing showed up to 30% improvement within the Parquet scanner for SELECT_STAR queries and big reduction in batch memory utilization.

I would say no, as the current default batch memory is set to 16MB; in practice record batches will have less than 64k rows when VL columns are involved.\r\n\r\n*Conclusion*\r\n- I like @paul-rogers suggestion to use the ValueVector.MAX_ROW_COUNT as it satisfies the goal of this JIRA (64k) and brings us one step further to standardization.
