Curator status \"STARTED\" does not mean you are connected. You must look at Curator's ConnectionState. Please see details here: <a href=\"http://curator.apache.org/errors.html\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://curator.apache.org/errors.html</a></p>\n\n<p>No - you do not have to close and restart the curator instances. The only reason to recreate the Curator Instances is if the ip/port of the ZooKeeper instances changes. If they don't change, there is no need to ever re-create the Curator instances. You can see copious tests in the Curator code base where this is proven. </p>\n\n<p>Also, from this Jira's description, it would be <em>wrong</em> to check isConnected before making requests. This, itself, might cause an outage. Curator internally manages the ZooKeeper connection. If you don't make any requests when isConnected is false you might never get a successful connection. </p>\n\n<p>You can see from the Curator example code (<a
