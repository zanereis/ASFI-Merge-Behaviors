Actions that don't feed the correct parameters to the downstream sequenced actions can't be used directly.  I encountered this when trying to store a document using cloudant/write, then pass that document to another action so I don't have to do a DB lookup.  The current cloudant/write action only returns the _id and _rev from Cloudant. I'm forced copy the cloudant/write action and customize it.  As @sjfink says, this is messy glue code. We're forcing developers to go through source code instead of just using shared packages off the shelf.\n\nThere's definitely a difference in authoring an action using the \"standalone\" mindset vs \"sequence\" mindset.  In my cloudant/write example, the current return object makes complete sense if the action is used standalone.  However, if I were to write a new cloudant/write action that I knew would only be used as part of a sequence, I would treat the input parameters much like Servlet Filters do -- I can use and modify the input parameters and then pass the mutated parameters down the line to the next action.  @rabbah 's idea of project parameters is a start -- could I have a mechanism to customize the behavior of an action depending on whether its running standalone or as part of a sequence?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/200911326/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/201003515","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/110#issuecomment-201003515","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/110","id":201003515,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwMTAwMzUxNQ==","user":{"login":"vinodmut","id":770084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MDA4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/770084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodmut","html_url":"https://github.com/vinodmut","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodmut/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodmut/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodmut/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodmut/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodmut/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodmut/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodmut/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodmut/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodmut/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-24T20:20:59Z","updated_at":"2016-03-24T20:22:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Note: @starpit's changes were merged in commit 0a4eda3.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/201003515/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/201021052","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/116#issuecomment-201021052","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/116","id":201021052,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwMTAyMTA1Mg==","user":{"login":"jthomas","id":2322,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jthomas","html_url":"https://github.com/jthomas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jthomas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jthomas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jthomas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jthomas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jthomas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jthomas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jthomas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jthomas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jthomas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-24T21:06:40Z","updated_at":"2016-03-24T21:06:40Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The current implementation feels more intuitive and simpler IMHO.

I think leaking by default may have the exact opposite effect. If we start with the restrictive model - which everyone I know of that initially complained later accepted - we can always relax later. Starting with the permissive mode makes it harder. Perhaps more real evidence needs to be collected on the common case. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/201038995/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/201043964","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/116#issuecomment-201043964","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/116","id":201043964,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwMTA0Mzk2NA==","user":{"login":"mbehrendt","id":4745697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDU2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4745697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbehrendt","html_url":"https://github.com/mbehrendt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbehrendt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbehrendt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbehrendt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbehrendt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbehrendt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbehrendt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbehrendt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbehrendt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbehrendt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-24T22:01:57Z","updated_at":"2016-03-24T22:01:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":">  if you can curry your arguments by binding them ahead of time to the action create, you can still apply the conservative mode of strict function composition\n\nwhile it is technically possible, binding action parameters (which are dynamically provided during runtime) before action invocation is not really a common pattern today and it also requires additional coding. i'm not against a more restrictive model, but we need to be clear that this limits the addressable set of scenarios / raises the barrier of entry. there is no good or bad -- it's just about trade-offs.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/201043964/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/201044233","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/116#issuecomment-201044233","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/116","id":201044233,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwMTA0NDIzMw==","user":{"login":"vinodmut","id":770084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MDA4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/770084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodmut","html_url":"https://github.com/vinodmut","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodmut/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodmut/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodmut/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodmut/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodmut/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodmut/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodmut/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodmut/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodmut/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-24T22:03:14Z","updated_at":"2016-03-24T22:19:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"As others have noted, this comes down to whether we want to make things **easy** or **safe**?

parameters\nreturn output3\n```\n\nIn JavaScript (with promises and some helper functions) it might look like this:\n\n```\nfunction main(input) {\n    var p1 = whisk.invoke('action1', input);\n\n    var p2 = p1.then(function(output1) {\n        return whisk.invoke('action2', merge(output1, input));\n    });\n\n    var p3 = p2.then(function(output2) {\n        return whisk.invoke('action3',

generally.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/201109964/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/201257779","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/121#issuecomment-201257779","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/121","id":201257779,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwMTI1Nzc3OQ==","user":{"login":"sjfink","id":1533170,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzMxNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1533170?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink","html_url":"https://github.com/sjfink","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-25T12:15:00Z","updated_at":"2016-03-25T12:15:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"PG

following host groups are currently in discussion:\n\n```\n[edge]\n[controllers]\n[loadbalancers]\n[activators]\n[kafka]\n[elasticsearch]\n[kibana]\n[entitlement]\n[invokers]\n```\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- A dedicated `edge` group allows us to potentially cluster NGINX. We did not call it NGINX because we want to make it clear that this is the group of hosts that is connected to the internet.\n- We separated `controllers` from edge to be able to scale controller independently from NGINX. Otherwise every node that acted as an edge host would have to run both NGINX and controller.\n  Also, with the work being done by @perryibm in issue #141 this allows us to easily move controller onto a different node, should we need more power.\n- `loadbalancers`and `activators`should also be able to scale on their own. With discussions trending towards merging those into controller, this might be a non-issue soon.\n- `kafka` used to scale kafka. we may need to split that into `zookeeper`and `kafka` depending on the way we want to scale out.\n- `elasticsearch` has been separated from `kibana` because it scales differently. we want many nodes to run a ES cluster but only one or two to run the kibana UI. \n- `entitlement` contains hosts for external entitlement services. usually empty on open.\n- `invokers` contains the invokers as usual.\n\n**Explanation Roles vs. Groups**\n\nNodes can play one or more roles in a deployment. For example, a node can act as a consul server, while another acts as a router. \n\nGroups are just collections of individual machines that can be addressed as one. Groups can also play one or more roles which will then propagate to all nodes in that group.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/203798580/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/203895683","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/145#issuecomment-203895683","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/145","id":203895683,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwMzg5NTY4Mw==","user":{"login":"cbickel","id":13397688,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzk3Njg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13397688?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel","html_url":"https://github.com/cbickel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-31T11:50:38Z","updated_at":"2016-03-31T12:21:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Pull
