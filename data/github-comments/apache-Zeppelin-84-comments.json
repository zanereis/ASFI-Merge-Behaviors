It you un-tar the whole archive there - it will take forever to sync \\w S3 and will defeat the purpose of cache on CI side, making build times longer.\n\nIf you ask me - I would say that before doing such big changes as refactoring of the build structure we all need very clear understanding and explanation of `what is the benefit` and what problem does this change solves. \n\nSo far I have not understood the answer to the questions above from PR description (may be my fault). But, in case of voting for such change, will make me at least `-0` for if, if not `-1` due to potential bugs that such changes will bring.\n\nIf that is reduction of convenience binary size - then we need to know how much does the size changes with the proposed changes to understand if that is worth. If that impacts CI build times - we also need to know how much.\n\nAlso regarding user experience - while running `zeppelin-demon.sh` user does not usually expect it to be network-dependant and download 100Mb archives - is there at least a user notification\\progress indicator? Otherwise there going to be bug reports like \"Zeppelin is not starting\" as soon as such change is introduced. \nAnd how about Windows users of Zeppelin? How about EMR\\Dataproc\\Juju\\BigTop users, will the proposed change affect them?\n\nPlease take it with the grain of salt, and of course I will be happy to help addressing each item addressed one by one.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/240905250/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/240906131","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1334#issuecomment-240906131","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1334","id":240906131,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MDkwNjEzMQ==","user":{"login":"bzz","id":5582506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1ODI1MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5582506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz","html_url":"https://github.com/bzz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-19T01:44:20Z","updated_at":"2016-08-19T01:44:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":">

And each revision can be shared independently\n4. importing new note by magnet link (should work similar to current \"import by URL\")\n\nBut again, the code to do all this have to be as much as possible hidden/composed behind the single entry-point of `BittorentNotebookRepo implements NotebookRepo`.\n\nWhat do you think?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/240913524/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/240913900","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1342#issuecomment-240913900","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1342","id":240913900,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MDkxMzkwMA==","user":{"login":"bzz","id":5582506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1ODI1MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5582506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz","html_url":"https://github.com/bzz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-19T02:46:09Z","updated_at":"2016-08-19T02:46:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Great fix @cloverhearts and very nice PR description 👍 \n\nLet's merge!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/240913900/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/240917443","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1343#issuecomment-240917443","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1343","id":240917443,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MDkxNzQ0Mw==","user":{"login":"agoodm","id":5179430,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzk0MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5179430?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm","html_url":"https://github.com/agoodm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-19T03:16:45Z","updated_at":"2016-08-19T03:16:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@bustios Thanks for the catch.

Let me break down your feedback one by one(just for making it clear) :)\n\n1.\n\n> /.spark-dist/ is under cache on TravisCI which is S3 bucket that gets synced automatically with the content of this folder while running a build. \n\nRight. That's my bad. I'll change the dir to another. Then how about `ZEPPELIN_HOME/interpreter/spark/` as like before? \n\n2, 3, 4.\n\n> what is the benefit and what problem does this change solves?\n\nActually I also tried to describe well about the current problem & the advantage of this change in Jira issue and the PR description, but i guess i didn't. I should've explain more clearly. Let me explain more in here with actual digit. (I'll update the Jira & PR description as well)\n- **What was the problem?**\n\nAs you said in the above, yes. The main problem is the Zeppelin binary package size. The latest version of Zeppelin bin size was\n\n```\nzeppelin-0.6.1-bin-all.tgz: 517MB\nzeppelin-0.6.1-bin-netinst.tgz: 236MB\n```\n\nDidn't we ask ASF infra team(?) every release because of Zeppelin's huge package size?\n- **What is the benefit?**\n\nWhen I created binary package without `spark-dependencies`, the each bin package size was\n\n```\nzeppelin-0.6.1-bin-all.tgz: 344MB\nzeppelin-0.6.1-bin-netinst.tgz: 64MB\n```\n\nAs you can see in the above those two cases' size diff is about `170MB`!  Moreover, users don't need to type build profiles i.e. `-Pr` or `-Psparkr`. I saw many users who are trying to use `%sparkr` in Zeppelin, they hit NPE because they didn't build with `-Psparkr`. It's truly confuse maybe they don't know well about the maven build mechanism. But with this change, they don't need to know about the complicating maven build profiles. \n\n5.\n\n> Also regarding user experience - while running zeppelin-demon.sh user does not usually expect it to be network-dependant and download 100Mb archives - is there at least a user notification\\progress indicator\n\nSo far, I just added below line to show in console after users start `zeppelin-daemon.sh`\n\n```\necho \"There is no SPARK_HOME in your system. After successful Spark bin installation, Zeppelin will be started.\"\n```\n\nThen it starts downloading Spark binary from the mirror site. I'm planning to add some description to README as we have provided many build profiles information in there. I also agree there must be better way to notify that instead of just writing about \"We will download 100MB Spark binary package if you don't set SPARK_HOME yet\" on README. \n\n6.\n\n> how about Windows users of Zeppelin? How about EMR\\Dataproc\\Juju\\BigTop users, will the proposed change affect them?\n\nAs you can see in the PR description `TODO`, I'm planning to create a `download-spark.cmd` file for Windows users. And regarding `EMR\\Dataproc\\Juju\\BigTop users`, I didn't catch that actually. So need more time to figure them out i think. \n\nAfter first I came up with removing `spark-dependencies` to reduce Zeppelin bin package size, I spent long time to think about how can we substitute the preexisting way seamlessly to provide embedded Spark in Zeppelin as like before. Please regard this PR as the first initiative. And will be appreciated if you can share your awesome idea about this issue!

The specific version of spark dependencies will be collected into \"${INTERPRETER_DIR}/dep\". When user doesn't have local spark installation, Zeppelin will load them in the classpath.\nWhen user have spark installation, Zeppelin allows user set SPARK_HOME to a different version that Zeppelin has been built with. It supposed to work. \n\nSo when SPARK_HOME is set, Zeppelin will run interpreter process with SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-submit command and it'll include spark dependencies under SPARK_HOME in the classpath. And the spark dependencies version can be different from dependencies in \"${INTERPRETER_DIR}/dep\". So we probably don't want to add \"${INTERPRETER_DIR}/dep\" into the classpath in this case.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/241268279/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/241273828","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1349#issuecomment-241273828","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1349","id":241273828,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MTI3MzgyOA==","user":{"login":"gbloisi","id":17691645,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NjkxNjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17691645?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gbloisi","html_url":"https://github.com/gbloisi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gbloisi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gbloisi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gbloisi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gbloisi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gbloisi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gbloisi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gbloisi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gbloisi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gbloisi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-21T18:37:59Z","updated_at":"2016-08-21T18:37:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for the explanation. I was using https://github.com/dylanmei/docker-zeppelin docker image and now I just realize it is shipping a spark-2.0.0 version not including hive dependecies (spark-2.0.0-bin-without-hadoop.tgz) and they are not even distributed with the separate hadoop package (hadoop-2.7.2.tar.gz).
