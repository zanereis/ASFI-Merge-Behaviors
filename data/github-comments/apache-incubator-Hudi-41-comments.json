@vinothchandar @smarthi thanks for review this pr.\r\n\r\nHere are my thoughts:\r\n1, It's right that most collections use `size()==0` inside their `isEmpty()` method, but that doesn't mean that they all do, for example `java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentSkipListSet`. \r\nThe [ConcurrentSkipListSet documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ConcurrentSkipListSet.html) says:\r\n```\r\nBeware that, unlike in most collections, the size method is not a constant-time operation.\r\n```\r\nIt means that `.size()` can be O(1) or O(N), depending on the data structure; `.isEmpty()` is never O(N).\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n2, IDE always prompts me to make changes.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20113411/72685195-af0ccd00-3b22-11ea-8e11-24051be6e26f.png)\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n3, In hudi project, some codes use `isEmpty()`, some codes `size() > 0`\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20113411/72685273-715c7400-3b23-11ea-9fb8-090c81f469d6.png)\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n4, `isEmpty()` is a clearer definition of what it is we actually care about, IMO, it's more understandable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/576026737/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/576058818","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/1254#issuecomment-576058818","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1254","id":576058818,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NjA1ODgxOA==","user":{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-19T23:17:40Z","updated_at":"2020-01-19T23:17:40Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@rongyousu

From the pom.xml you shared above - https://github.com/stefanbirkner/system-rules/blob/system-rules-1.16.0/pom.xml it does seem like junit-dep is a compile time dependency. You also mentioned that this dependency is not used anywhere and so you are adding the exclusion. Did you see any build time warning or dependency conflicts in Hudi that caused you to raised this PR? Can you please clarify? \r\nAlthough this is a simple change, there might be other unused dependencies from external libraries same like this case. We havent gone after them unless the jar size is bloating or there are conflicts etc. Thats why understanding your case would help us better to determine if others also need to be checked out.
