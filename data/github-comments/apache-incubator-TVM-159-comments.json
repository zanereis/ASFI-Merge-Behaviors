It will help reduce/remove those 1-off deviations.\r\n\r\nOne request that I have is - While setting the rounding mode to TFLite in TFLite parser, it might be better to set it by adding an extra arg in `from_tflite` API. The main reason is that the lowering here might involve many more number of Relay ops, which might degrade performance. So, to enable TVM user to choose different accuracy-performance tradeoff points, we can add a new argument in the TFLite parser API, and then pass it along to the QNN ops. The default value of this arg can be tflite rounding. @FrozenGene Are you ok with this?\r\n\r\n@u99127 @mbarrett97 will also be interested in this.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think we can have small PRs merged.

The main reason is that the lowering here might involve many more number of Relay ops, which might degrade performance. So, to enable TVM user to choose different accuracy-performance tradeoff points, we can add a new argument in the TFLite parser API, and then pass it along to the QNN ops. The default value of this arg can be tflite rounding. @FrozenGene Are you ok with this?\r\n\r\nYes, this is my thought too. I am ok with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n> LGTM. I like the scope of this PR. IMO, we can get this in. And send other PRs for TFLite parser.\r\n\r\nIMO, I would prefer adding TFLite parser in this PR too. Because this will be organized into one complete solution for TFLite rounding. When others review the history, they don't need to check isolated PRs together to get complete support for TFLite rounding support. Maybe these PRs during time is long. It is right that we could make small prs and merge it in quickly so that we could get functionality supporting quickly and could locate the reason quickly. However, from this pr's perspective, TFLite's parser code will not be complex and could be contained in. It is acceptable in one single PR from my opinion. So I would suggest @LiangHao151941 adding TFLite parser in this PR too. If we think it is import, we even could port this back to release 0.6, one PR will make us do it easily too.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/583218692/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/583233499","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4822#issuecomment-583233499","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4822","id":583233499,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MzIzMzQ5OQ==","user":{"login":"FrozenGene","id":7287321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyODczMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7287321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene","html_url":"https://github.com/FrozenGene","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-07T04:54:28Z","updated_at":"2020-02-07T04:54:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@u99127 @inadob Please approve explicitly if you think this PR is good now.

since there's no way of reporting what issues affect what versions in github issues ?\r\n\r\nThis is probably worth a discuss post, however I'll say my piece here in response to the comment about point releases. \r\n\r\nReleasing from a release branch is the next step in my opinion. The first set of steps towards this are to:\r\n\r\n1. Be reasonably clear about the criteria for backports.  There is not always a clear answer but correctness issues are likely to need backports but then you don't want a too risky backport so that we are not chasing bug tails by introducing a new bug to fix an old one.  Thus there needs to be a risk vs reward evaluation by either a group of release managers or the reviewer community in an objective manner. For example this fix and the related fix to fixup the tests is appropriate, however large fixes that require refactoring changes will not be at which point you need a different fix. \r\n\r\n2. Reviewers need to help that contributors improve descriptions in the pull request and ask the question which release branches a particular issue affects. Further if pull requests combine bug fixes with new features especially regression fixes, such pull requests need to be split up as our current policy is to squash commits and then it's not obvious what came from where if we want someone to do a bit of archeology.\r\n\r\n3. Optionally add this to the template of the Pull Request reminding developers submitting bug fixes that they could help the project by considering whether a pull request requires a backport or not.\r\n\r\n4. We need an update to the contributor's guide \r\n\r\n5. How do we help the reporter report the version that the issue was reported in ? Currently it's free form text but if that were a drop down list that would be great and thus keeping that information there. \r\n\r\n6. Finally decide how long we would keep a branch going - what's the branch management lifecycle ? \r\n\r\nMy 2 cents.\r\nregards\r\nRamana","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/583660260/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/583661376","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/4824#issuecomment-583661376","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4824","id":583661376,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MzY2MTM3Ng==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-07T23:37:15Z","updated_at":"2020-02-07T23:37:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@u99127 perhaps we can open a discuss thread on the forum.

I want to describe my development way, maybe it could help you. For example, we have mobilenetv2 quantized model, you could get the quantized tensorflow and tflite model. Then you could call tflite_convert (feed it quantized tensorflow model) and set the output layer (for example, just the first convolution layer), then you get one quantized tflite model only contain the first convolution layer of mobilenet v2. After you verify it correctly, you could go on until you finish the whole model e2e correctly.

Considering that this is a relatively standalone pass and it helps fusion with external functions, I think it is okay to take it in.\r\n\r\nFor the pattern matching cases, one possible way I am thinking of is automatically generating some possible pattern given some metadata.\r\n\r\n@comaniac and I will start an RFC to discuss how we can add the whitelist based annotation back. It probably will leverage the pattern matching here.\r\n\r\n@masahi @anijain2305 PTAL and share your comments if there is any.
