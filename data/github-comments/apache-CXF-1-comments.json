And does that whether the content is good or bad xml, trunkated or not.\n\nConsider this valid xml string:\n\n``` xml\n<a><b><c></c></b></a>\n```\n\nif it is trunkated to \n\n``` xml\n<a><b>\n```\n\nthen the current approach would give you\n\n``` xml\n<a><b></b></a>\n```\n\nas the closing tags are added. This is not only a string which is longer than the limit, it might give the impression that there is no c element. This is clearly a good way to create misunderstandings. \n\nAnother use-case: This one shows that inserting an 'content trunkated' message and then adding end tags is not a good idea either\n\nConsider this invalid xml string:\n\n``` xml\n<a><b><c></c></a>\n```\n\nif it is trunkated to \n\n``` xml\n<a><b><c></c>\n```\n\nthen the current approach would give you\n\n``` xml\n<a><b><c></c></b></a>\n```\n\nwhich is valid xml.

somewhere I remember reading the missing charset is supposed to be interpreted as charset utf-8 in http. But the current mime RFC [1] as well as w3c's internationalization document both mention the missing charset means iso-8859-1. So, I don't remember where I read the defautl utf-8 convention. \n\nBut here I was talking about not the default but the invalid charset syntax. Something went wrong or programmed wrong and a client is sending a content-type header with\nContent-Type: text/xml; charset=\n\nThe above specs say the charset value must be a valid IANA charset value.  In this case, we don't know why the client generated this invalid charset entry. Was it trying to set the system default charset and didn't realize the value was null? Or something else went wrong? Hence, simply ignoring this invalid charset parameter and defaulting to utf-8 will hide this problem from our eyes and potentially lead to the incorrect decoding.\n\n[1] https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230\n[2] http://www.w3.org/International/O-HTTP-charset#charset\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/151432528/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/151457508","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cxf/pull/89#issuecomment-151457508","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/89","id":151457508,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MTQ1NzUwOA==","user":{"login":"sberyozkin","id":467639,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NzYzOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/467639?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sberyozkin","html_url":"https://github.com/sberyozkin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sberyozkin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sberyozkin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sberyozkin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sberyozkin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sberyozkin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sberyozkin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sberyozkin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sberyozkin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sberyozkin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-27T11:07:30Z","updated_at":"2015-10-27T11:07:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sorry, I meant ISO-8859-1, my fault.
