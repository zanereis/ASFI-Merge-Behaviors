reverted this as we didn't have good test coverage. Basically the strict trace ID setting still includes the ability to read data prior to when the switch happened. That is `getTrace_retrievesBy128BitTraceId_afterSwitch` test.\r\n\r\nThis makes the issue more difficult because on one hand, if data is uniform, we should totally never even try to do mixed stuff. OTOH, we do want people to use strict ID, so we have to facilitate migrations.\r\n\r\nI think we can handle this a little differently by looking at the length of the trace IDs inside the search results.\r\n\r\nOne approach is: look to see if any trace IDs clash on lower 64bits.

filter.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/440118179/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/440121874","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/2148#issuecomment-440121874","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2148","id":440121874,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MDEyMTg3NA==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-20T03:10:36Z","updated_at":"2018-11-20T03:10:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"closing
