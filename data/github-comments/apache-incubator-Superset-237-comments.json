This list is then added to the `query_obj`, which is used to calculate the cache key. So instead of writing\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM user WHERE username = '{{ current_username() }}'\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne would write\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM user WHERE username = '{{ cache_key_wrapper(current_username()) }}'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should be fairly easy to implement, is very straight forward to use, and gives the end user full freedom of which keys will be passed to the cache key.

Those investigators are not able (knowledge wise) to create their own dashboards / queries for this particular investigation.\r\n\r\nSo, we have two tables one with 25M transactions and another with 6M unique account numbers. A users needs to be able to filter the account number table to find a specific account number. Selecting this should then also filter the transaction table which can be a lot of transactions (easily > 70K)\r\n\r\nWe have two options we have a filter box to select the account number this however seems to have a hard coded limit of much lower than the 6M we need. So this means missing account numbers when a user searches. Second option is to create another table which has a search box and can emit filter events. We can control the limit here, but 6M accounts will be sent to the browser as filtering happens clients side even if we use 'pagination'. If we set the limit to something the browser can handle the search will miss account numbers.\r\n\r\nOn your comments. I think you are missing the mark, cause you seem to be talking about exports. We literally just need to be able to filter a large table on the front end without blowing up the browser and doing efficiently as multiple users will use the same tables.\r\n\r\nIf needed we can have a video chat to show the issue. Fixing this would really help superset adoption (at least with us ;-) ) as it enables some really big dashboards.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/507576911/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/507582793","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/7406#issuecomment-507582793","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/7406","id":507582793,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNzU4Mjc5Mw==","user":{"login":"mikalai-dev","id":10799069,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzk5MDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10799069?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikalai-dev","html_url":"https://github.com/mikalai-dev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikalai-dev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikalai-dev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikalai-dev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikalai-dev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikalai-dev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikalai-dev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikalai-dev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikalai-dev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikalai-dev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-02T08:47:41Z","updated_at":"2019-07-02T08:47:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I've faced with the same issue on the superset docker instance builded from git.

Removing the UI stuff is a much bigger can of worms than I had anticipated, and there is major risk of feature creep that will derail the originally neatly limited scope of just getting a few deps out of `setup.py` and `requirements.txt`. I vote for removing the last commit and going back to the last one that cleared CI.\r\n\r\nOne thing that might clean up the code somewhat is to try to import `pydruid` at the earliest possible moment, e.g. `superset/__init__.py` and setting an app config flag as false if `pydruid` isn't present. Later on one would only need to check that, instead of doing a bunch of trying and catching on the imports. But like I said I'm not really sure about this one, and would now just try to finish this PR as quickly as possible, but if you feel this might have merit and if it's quick to implement then it might make the code slightly cleaner.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/508556124/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/508570323","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/7817#issuecomment-508570323","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/7817","id":508570323,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwODU3MDMyMw==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-04T20:23:44Z","updated_at":"2019-07-04T20:23:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Minor change, merging without review.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/508570323/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/508595513","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/7823#issuecomment-508595513","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/7823","id":508595513,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwODU5NTUxMw==","user":{"login":"issue-label-bot[bot]","id":48611044,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDg2MTEwNDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/27079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/issue-label-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-05T00:35:06Z","updated_at":"2019-07-05T00:35:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Issue Label Bot is not confident enough to auto-label this issue.
