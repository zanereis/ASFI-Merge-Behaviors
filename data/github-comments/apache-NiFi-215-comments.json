To use this approach properly, potentially some refactoring will be needed on handler level and below. For example, in UpdateAssetOperation handler the exception is logged, an optional is returned only. We should move away from the optional approach in favor of exception managed approach like in UpdateConfigurationOperationHandler.\r\n> * Please squash the commits.

This is part of the reason for each workflow running in different time zones, as it surfaces time zone specific assumptions.\r\n\r\nInstead of attempting to set the time zone, the expected values need to be constructed in a way that the resolved values matched the expected values.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2307802425/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2307848650","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/8965#issuecomment-2307848650","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/8965","id":2307848650,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM6JjvnK","user":{"login":"mcgilman","id":123395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzM5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman","html_url":"https://github.com/mcgilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-23T21:43:56Z","updated_at":"2024-08-23T21:43:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @mcgilman Sorry the pinging again.
