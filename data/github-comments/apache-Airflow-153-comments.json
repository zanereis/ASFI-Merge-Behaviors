On my personal account it \"just worked\" after I updated my fork and pushed a branch.\r\n\r\nOn my GitHub org account, it worked after adding our org to Travis CI then specifically granting access to the incubator-airflow repo (even though it's public).  I don't think I ever did that on my personal but I could have forgotten.  In any case, it's working great.\r\n\r\n_Note: I had to change .org to .com in the URL to see my builds.  Not sure if this is unique to me or the same for everyone as I setup my personal account on the .com site a few months ago._\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/410482645/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/410482688","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3646#issuecomment-410482688","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3646","id":410482688,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMDQ4MjY4OA==","user":{"login":"tedmiston","id":366688,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NjY4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/366688?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedmiston","html_url":"https://github.com/tedmiston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedmiston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedmiston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedmiston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedmiston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedmiston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedmiston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedmiston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedmiston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedmiston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-04T22:48:10Z","updated_at":"2018-08-04T22:48:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing this PR for now as I have more work to do here before it can be merged.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/410482688/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/410482953","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3684#issuecomment-410482953","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3684","id":410482953,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMDQ4Mjk1Mw==","user":{"login":"caddac","id":5695743,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2OTU3NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5695743?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caddac","html_url":"https://github.com/caddac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caddac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caddac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caddac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caddac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caddac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caddac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caddac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caddac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caddac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-04T22:55:15Z","updated_at":"2018-08-04T22:55:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Would updating all of the connections be acceptable?
