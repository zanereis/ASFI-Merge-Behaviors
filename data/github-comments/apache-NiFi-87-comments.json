re: the unit test failure, I don't believe that it's actually related to the previous PR necessarily, but is just a timing issue that happened to trigger here. We could certainly raise the timeout used - it was waiting up to 2 seconds for the processor state to become STOPPED in the unit test. We could certainly raise that to 10 seconds or so. I think the timeout chosen was fairly arbitrary and increasing it would only increase the amount of time that the tests takes to complete when needed to. If the state transitions to STOPPED after 25 milliseconds then that's all that it'll wait.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/390700814/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/390712869","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2727#issuecomment-390712869","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2727","id":390712869,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MDcxMjg2OQ==","user":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-21T16:48:13Z","updated_at":"2018-05-21T16:48:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@MikeThomsen

I think I understand now what you were seeing.

I have created a new JIRA for this, though, NIFI-5222, as I don't think it's something that should really block merging this PR in. The issue appears to be that we kick off validation 3 times each time that we click \"Update\" and so if we update both DebugFlow processors, we end up kicking off 6 validation tasks instead of 2, and that ends up blocking UpdateAttribute since we have only 5 threads in the pool.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/390754184/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/390825485","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2727#issuecomment-390825485","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2727","id":390825485,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MDgyNTQ4NQ==","user":{"login":"ijokarumawak","id":1107620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak","html_url":"https://github.com/ijokarumawak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-22T00:29:04Z","updated_at":"2018-05-22T00:29:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@ottobackwards Thanks for hardening the validation, LGTM +1.

From the perspective of the DMC interface, the API for getAndPutIfAbsent is saying it will only do a put if the key wasn't there. So I wouldn't really expect anything about the key to change unless the put was performed, so I lean towards not updating the TTL when the key was already there because to me the TTL is part of the put which didn't happen.\r\n\r\nThe current logic in PutDistributedMapCache looks like if \"keep original\" is chosen and there is an existing value for the key, then it routes to failure, so I don't think that should be changed unless someone believes that is a bug and wasn't the intended behavior.\r\n\r\nI was also looking at the commands again, and I noticed this as another way to do a put-if-absent with TTL:\r\n\r\n`redisConnection.set(kv.getKey(), kv.getValue(), Expiration.milliseconds(-1), RedisStringCommands.SetOption.ifAbsent());`\r\n\r\nThe only issue is that \"setnx\" returns a boolean that tells us if the set was done which we check after the transaction is done, and \"set\" is void, so I'm not sure if it is better to just use setnx + expire.

Don't you think it would be useful to add a header, or attribute with avro-like generated schema? I agree that specified attributes will be in provided order, but if regex is used - then user won't be able to relate a value to a name.
