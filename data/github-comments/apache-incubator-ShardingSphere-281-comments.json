Methods declared by `@Test` should not have parameters\r\n2. The method `containsTable` belongs to `ShardingSphereSchema` (but not `ShardingSphereMetaData`) and can be called by `schemaMetaData.getSchema().containsTable(tableName)`\r\n3. The process of refreshing table metadata needs to read table information from the database, so we have to mock this method: `TableMetaDataBuilder.load`\r\n\r\nHere is a working example, you can improve the test logic as you want:\r\n```java\r\nmport org.apache.shardingsphere.infra.config.props.ConfigurationProperties;\r\nimport
