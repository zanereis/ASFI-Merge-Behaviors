I've merged your change into the trunk and pushed it to the Apache Software Foundation repositories. The way it works is that we don't merge directly on github but instead merge the commits to trunk, sign the commits, and then once we push it the asfgit bot will come by to sync the repo back to github and close the pull request. Your change is now [in the current trunk](https://github.com/apache/libcloud/commit/dd6aaba856d5f3ed6e8a05c4f92465a968af450d) and the change has been documented [here in the CHANGES file](https://github.com/apache/libcloud/commit/080b343e0983f2a22f7647b4fd8cebb3339adbe2). What should happen in relation to the JIRA ticket and how the documentation is used to generate the readthedocs website I do not know.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/442107236/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/442113075","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/1259#issuecomment-442113075","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/1259","id":442113075,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MjExMzA3NQ==","user":{"login":"iler","id":592269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MjI2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/592269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iler","html_url":"https://github.com/iler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-27T16:01:08Z","updated_at":"2018-11-27T16:01:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vdloo Ok, I'm cool with that.

I noticed two changes in behavior with these newly implemented methods:\r\n\r\nbefore:\r\n```\r\nIn [12]: conn.destroy_volume_snapshot(mysnap)\r\nOut[12]: False\r\n```\r\n\r\nafter:\r\n```\r\nIn [20]: conn.destroy_volume_snapshot(mysnap)\r\nOut[20]: True\r\n```\r\n\r\nbefore:\r\n```\r\nIn [24]: conn.ex_delete_security_group_rule(mysecgrouprule)\r\nOut[24]: False\r\n```\r\n\r\nafter:\r\n```\r\nIn [48]: conn.ex_delete_security_group_rule(mysecgrouprule)\r\nOut[48]: True\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis has to do with the httplib.ACCEPTED thing so that's fine. It does mean however that because previously these two methods were inherited from the OpenStack_1_1_NodeDriver this behavior will now change for OpenStack_2_NodeDriver users. That's OK I think. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe other new implementation behave exactly the same:\r\n\r\nbefore:\r\n```\r\nIn [3]: conn.list_volumes()\r\nOut[3]: \r\n[<StorageVolume

Have you signed an ICLA or CCLA? I'm not sure if that is necessary but since this is not a new provider driver, but this is a bigger change. Perhaps @tonybaloney can chime in on that. \r\n\r\nAlso once I merge this, to make it clear what has changed in the CHANGES.rst file I would like to add multiple lines describing this PR instead of the regular [one line](https://github.com/apache/libcloud/commit/080b343e0983f2a22f7647b4fd8cebb3339adbe2). Not sure if that is intended but it would seem like the right thing to do with this PR.\r\n\r\n```\r\n- [OpenStack] Implement OpenStack_2_NodeDriver ex_create_subnet (LIBCLOUD-874, GITHUB-1242)\r\n  [Miguel Caballer]\r\n\r\n- [OpenStack] Implement OpenStack_2_NodeDriver ex_delete_subnet (LIBCLOUD-874, GITHUB-1242)\r\n  [Miguel Caballer]\r\n\r\n- [OpenStack] Implement OpenStack_2_NodeDriver list_volumes (LIBCLOUD-874, GITHUB-1242)\r\n  [Miguel Caballer]\r\n\r\n- [OpenStack] Implement OpenStack_2_NodeDriver ex_get_volume (LIBCLOUD-874, GITHUB-1242)\r\n  [Miguel Caballer]\r\n\r\n- [OpenStack] Implement OpenStack_2_NodeDriver create_volume (LIBCLOUD-874, GITHUB-1242)\r\n  [Miguel Caballer]\r\n\r\n- [OpenStack] Implement OpenStack_2_NodeDriver destroy_volume (LIBCLOUD-874, GITHUB-1242)\r\n  [Miguel Caballer]\r\n\r\n- [OpenStack] Implement OpenStack_2_NodeDriver ex_list_snapshots (LIBCLOUD-874, GITHUB-1242)\r\n  [Miguel Caballer]\r\n\r\n- [OpenStack] Implement OpenStack_2_NodeDriver create_volume_snapshot (LIBCLOUD-874, GITHUB-1242)\r\n  [Miguel Caballer]\r\n\r\n- [OpenStack] Implement OpenStack_2_NodeDriver destroy_volume_snapshot (LIBCLOUD-874, GITHUB-1242)\r\n  [Miguel Caballer]\r\n\r\n- [OpenStack] Implement OpenStack_2_NodeDriver ex_list_security_groups (LIBCLOUD-874, GITHUB-1242)\r\n  [Miguel Caballer]\r\n\r\n- [OpenStack] Implement OpenStack_2_NodeDriver ex_create_security_group (LIBCLOUD-874, GITHUB-1242)\r\n  [Miguel Caballer]\r\n\r\n- [OpenStack] Implement OpenStack_2_NodeDriver ex_delete_security_group (LIBCLOUD-874, GITHUB-1242)\r\n  [Miguel Caballer]\r\n\r\n- [OpenStack] Implement OpenStack_2_NodeDriver ex_create_security_group_rule (LIBCLOUD-874, GITHUB-1242)\r\n  [Miguel Caballer]\r\n\r\n- [OpenStack] Implement OpenStack_2_NodeDriver ex_delete_security_group_rule (LIBCLOUD-874, GITHUB-1242)\r\n  [Miguel Caballer]\r\n\r\n- [OpenStack] Implement OpenStack_2_NodeDriver ex_list_floating_ip_pools (LIBCLOUD-874, GITHUB-1242)\r\n  [Miguel Caballer]\r\n\r\n- [OpenStack] Fix parse_error if 'code' not in API response message (GITHUB-1242)\r\n  [Miguel Caballer]\r\n\r\n- [OpenStack] Adapt _to_port function to work with old OpenStack versions (GITHUB-1242)\r\n  [Miguel Caballer]\r\n``` ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/442434265/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/442438518","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/1244#issuecomment-442438518","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/1244","id":442438518,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MjQzODUxOA==","user":{"login":"vdloo","id":1437341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzczNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1437341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdloo","html_url":"https://github.com/vdloo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdloo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdloo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdloo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdloo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdloo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdloo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdloo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdloo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdloo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-28T13:00:26Z","updated_at":"2018-11-28T13:00:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@palashgandhi since I don't work with Azure I don't feel qualified approve and merge this PR [as I mentioned here a while back](https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/1231#issuecomment-410796779).

Python 2.5 and 2.6 which don't have the assertIsNone aren't tested in the [travis file anymore anyway](https://github.com/apache/libcloud/commit/25c4d99b50017e4fd233ad03fa56d337e99ef451).

Perhaps just calling _get_auth_headers and checking if `version=5.5` is in the Accept key of the dict would be sufficient. Unit tests both serve to document behavior and prevent stuff from accidentally being changed later on, so even though that would be a pretty trivial test I think it would still hold value.\r\n\r\nAlso I have a question here as I am not that familiar with the vcloud APIs.
