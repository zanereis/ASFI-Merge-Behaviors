created a test for this condition but I'm not happy with the way it's implemented.\r\nJust take a look at it:\r\n```java\r\n    @Test\r\n    public void testExceptionThrownWhenFileRecordsAreTruncatedDuringWrite() throws IOException {\r\n        File file = tempFile();\r\n        FileChannel channel = new RandomAccessFile(file, \"r\").getChannel();\r\n        GatheringByteChannel destination = null;\r\n\r\n        FileRecords fieldRecordsPartialMock = EasyMock.partialMockBuilder(FileRecords.class)\r\n                .withConstructor(file, channel, 0, Integer.MAX_VALUE, false)\r\n                .addMockedMethod(\"sizeInBytes\")\r\n                .createNiceMock();\r\n\r\n        EasyMock.expect(fieldRecordsPartialMock.sizeInBytes()).andReturn(42);\r\n        EasyMock.replay(fieldRecordsPartialMock);\r\n\r\n        try {\r\n

}\r\n```\r\nThe underlying behaviour relies on multithreaded condition and for current implementation it's not as simple to test as one would like to (which might be the reason why it wasn't tested in the beginning).\r\nWith my current understanding of Kafka's internals I don't feel competent enough to refactor the implementation (I'm also not convinced that it should be refactored solely for making testing that condition easier).\r\nI wouldn't like to add this test to the test suite because it does a poor job at documenting the scenario due to using a partial mock (the only way to do it for current implementation without unnecessarily tying to the implementation) and requiring multiple values not related to the tested behaviour.\r\nMoreover I don't see further changes coming to this piece of code that might be covered by that test.\r\nMaybe you have a better way to test this scenario?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/268042223/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/268046397","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2214#issuecomment-268046397","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2214","id":268046397,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2ODA0NjM5Nw==","user":{"login":"resetius","id":2862690,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NjI2OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2862690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/resetius","html_url":"https://github.com/resetius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/resetius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/resetius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/resetius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/resetius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/resetius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/resetius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/resetius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/resetius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/resetius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-19T18:54:15Z","updated_at":"2016-12-19T18:54:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I

performance graph (avg of 3 runs). A couple of takeaways:\r\n\r\n- Trunk and PR have comparable performance in the \"no metrics recorded\" case. Worse case difference is around 2% better for trunk in one case and 5% better for PR in another case.\r\n\r\n- Both trunk and PR see a similar drop in performance when collecting some metrics (INFO)\r\n\r\n- Notice how the PR's INFO metrics does better than Trunk's metrics. That is because in the PR the state store metrics are now DEBUG, so we're collecting fewer metrics by default. I'll get another graph where the PR temporarily assigns INFO to the store metrics, for a better apple-to-apple comparison.\r\n- Worst case scenario drop in perf for DEBUG: 60%. Best case drop: 20%\r\n\r\n- Worst case drop in perf for INFO: 11%. Best case drop: 3% (compare with current trunk below).\r\n\r\n- Worst case drop in perf for trunk metrics: 17%. Best case drop: 9%.\r\n\r\n- Not relevant for this PR, but looks like all numbers have moved up from the last graph. That's good.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/268106260/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/268106623","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2278#issuecomment-268106623","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2278","id":268106623,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2ODEwNjYyMw==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-19T23:15:16Z","updated_at":"2016-12-19T23:15:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer

for the newly updated stats @enothereska . A few quick question:\r\n\r\n0. For the comparison you mentioned above \"worst case .. best case\", they are all compared with trunk with metrics turned on right?\r\n\r\n1. Regarding `Worst case drop in perf for INFO: 11%. Best case drop: 3% (compare with current trunk below).` since you mention this PR's INFO metrics perf is better than trunk's metrics, I was assuming that the best case perf drop should be a negative ratio?\r\n\r\n2. Regarding `Worst case drop in perf for trunk metrics: 17%. Best case drop: 9%.` What does this mean? I thought for `trunk metrics` it means INFO + state store metrics, but it seems you have not got the results for this
