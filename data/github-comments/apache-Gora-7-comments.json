But most essentials one where persisting objects is happening while searching and deleting support is being added via JOOQ library for mysql database. Most test cases are failing because that test cases contains complex data structures such as RECORD, MAP & ARRAY where those are persisted in the database but the conversion of these db fields to Avro beans isn't implemented yet apart from the Union shema type. Adding support to complex data structures alone will pass most of the test cases which are failing. WebPage table uses lot of these complex datatypes to store its data where my current datastore doesn't provide the support to these schema types is what causing the failure of test cases.\r\n\r\nBut if you run this datastore with simple data types such as string and integers the datastore works without a problem. Regardless of the out come of the Gsoc Project I am planning to contribute to the project and finish this datastore. There are few more code tweaks to support all relational database such as connection string such as that and to specify. Added that this project will be complete. There is one more main method from the datastore which i didn't implement is delete by query. Which i will be doing in the future as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gora/issues/comments/903323925/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gora/issues/comments/950010559","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gora/pull/250#issuecomment-950010559","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gora/issues/250","id":950010559,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATAjb844oAK_","user":{"login":"khadijm","id":88087734,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MDg3NzM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/88087734?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/khadijm","html_url":"https://github.com/khadijm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khadijm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khadijm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khadijm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khadijm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khadijm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khadijm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khadijm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khadijm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khadijm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-22T23:21:02Z","updated_at":"2021-10-22T23:21:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"this
