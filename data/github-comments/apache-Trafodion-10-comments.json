It looks like the old code looked around for a node running Cloudera Manager, then ran a bunch of things on that node. The new code just runs things on the local node. So, I take it that the tacit assumption in the old code was that HDFS would be running on any node where Cloudera Manager was running but that assumption turns out not to be true? The new tacit assumption is that HDFS is running on the local node.

That is correct. In all our previous\ntesting I thought they would always be together. That is not the case at\nall. Actually, from further study they are almost never together that is\nnot the recommended configuration.\n\nThe new tacit assumption is that HDFS is running on the local node. Why is\nthis a better assumption? Trafodion must be installed on nodes with HBase\nand HBase needs HDFS. Trafodion does a check (not in this file... earlier\nin install) that makes sure every node being installed on has HBase (so by\nproxy HDFS).\n\nAn improvement in the future will be for the installer to be ran from\nanywhere. Example: Hadoop Nodes n1 n2 n3 n4  Trafodion nodes n3 n4 and\ninstall from n0 (a node not in cluster) n1-n4.\n\nOn Thu, Oct 29, 2015 at 8:47 AM, DaveBirdsall notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> Just making sure I understand the fix.

for delayed response reviewers.\nI was looking into addressing Selva's comments but would like to defer them now\na) To set filesUser, filesGroup and filesMode on target cluster when FileUtil.copy is used, I could use the preserveAttributes method that is in Hbase' ExportSnapshot class. The method would have to be made more wide widely available than its current private visibility. I would like to look into how refactoring can be done better and also think of a way to test this change. Currently I don't have a cluster where hbase is installed under a different id.\nb) Testing on apache and hdp will be good. I will try to add a small regression test to the backup script. Also need more time to get access to hdp and vanilla apache clusters.\n\nI hope the change can be merged for now and I will address these two issue in my next delivery in this area.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/154123762/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/154135878","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/158#issuecomment-154135878","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/158","id":154135878,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NDEzNTg3OA==","user":{"login":"DaveBirdsall","id":5659628,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk2Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5659628?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveBirdsall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-05T17:49:13Z","updated_at":"2015-11-05T17:49:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Selva, are you good with that?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/154135878/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/154150371","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/158#issuecomment-154150371","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/158","id":154150371,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NDE1MDM3MQ==","user":{"login":"selvaganesang","id":8702996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MDI5OTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8702996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang","html_url":"https://github.com/selvaganesang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-05T18:48:40Z","updated_at":"2015-11-05T18:48:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes.
