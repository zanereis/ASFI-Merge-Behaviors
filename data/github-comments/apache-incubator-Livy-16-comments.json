The goal of HA is to ensure that amoung a group of Livy Servers, only 1 is Active at \r\nany given time while the others are on Standby. Our changes are as following:\r\n\r\nLeveraging Zookeeper to handle Leader Election:\r\nIn order to achieve HA, we need a service to handle keeping track of the current leader. To do this, we created a CuratorElectorService class which will register the Livy Server \r\ninstance into the Leader election group and keep track of the leader. This class leverages the Apache Curator LeaderLatch Library to keep track of the current leader. \r\nThis class is also responsible for restarting the Livy Webserver when it transitions from Standby state to Active. This restart is where the Livy Webserver performs session recovery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRedirecting to the active webserver:\r\nWith the CuratorElectorService class, Livy Server can now determine whether it is Active or on Standby. If it is active, it proceeds as usual. However, if it is on standby, it will\r\nuse the configuration in livy.conf to determine the endpoint to redirect the request to.\r\n\r\n\r\nCreating configurations to enable HA:\r\nWe added user configurations to enable HA. These include specifying whether or not HA is enabled, the endpoints of the Livy Server instances used for HA, and the zookeeper instances \r\nused for leader election.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSplitting Livy's start() function to init() and start():\r\nCurrently, Livy's start() function is overloaded to both initalize all of its components (the webserver, its servlets, and session managers) and then safely start them. This PR\r\nseparates the start() function into an init() component and a start() components. This is to allow us to restart the session managers and trigger session recovery without having\r\nto safely tear down and rebuild the Livy Webserver every time. \r\n\r\n@jerryshao can I get some eyes for a code review/suggestions?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/comments/597378861/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/comments/597922611","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-livy/pull/284#issuecomment-597922611","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/284","id":597922611,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NzkyMjYxMQ==","user":{"login":"wypoon","id":3925490,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjU0OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3925490?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon","html_url":"https://github.com/wypoon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-11T23:03:24Z","updated_at":"2020-03-11T23:03:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I adopted Imran's suggestion for rewriting `incrementConnections`.\r\nI also added a test case for multiple connection limits being violated; the error message is for the first limit that we check.\r\nI am passing on additional nice-to-have tests.
