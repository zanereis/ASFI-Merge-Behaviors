Did have brief conversation with @geertjanw about that during last release phase.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/534707673/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/534759483","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1529#issuecomment-534759483","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/1529","id":534759483,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNDc1OTQ4Mw==","user":{"login":"jlahoda","id":124144,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDE0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/124144?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda","html_url":"https://github.com/jlahoda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-24T21:38:54Z","updated_at":"2019-09-24T21:38:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"If we can catch 11.2, yes, would be nice (it is a bugfix).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/534759483/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/534926007","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1270#issuecomment-534926007","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/1270","id":534926007,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNDkyNjAwNw==","user":{"login":"neilcsmith-net","id":3975960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3975960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net","html_url":"https://github.com/neilcsmith-net","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-25T09:02:30Z","updated_at":"2019-09-25T09:02:30Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@ebarboni the commit history on this looks like it's going a bit awry now?!

Your author email ends with \"@users.noreply.github.com\"\r\n\r\nI guess it's overwritten by GitHub.\r\nAny Idea how to avoid this behavior?\r\n(Maybe this was due that I just fix the code directly from the Web GUI instead of clone the entire repo). If somebody can help me avoid this I'll place my email without problems.\r\n \r\n>     2. This changeset introduces a regression for ruby sass users. Without the \"--cache-location\" parameter, the cache is placed into the `public_html` directory. That way it pollutes the work space of the user.\r\n\r\nThis is right but should be left as it is. 1) the Ruby version is supported but deprecated and should not be used anymore. 2) if you still want to use the Ruby version, you can always add all the arguments that you need on the command line in the Project Properties in order to get the behaviour you want.\r\n\r\nEverybody use the command line option to add `--style=compressed`.\r\nIf Ruby folks have to add also `--cache-location` on old version of SASS I think is quite acceptable and not so a bad deal instead to have a broken compilar for anybody else.\r\n\r\nI think we should avoid to hard-code old/deprecated/distribution-specific arguments that will break any other version of SASS.\r\n\r\n> What do you think about this idea: use the \"--help\" call to see which options are supported. If an option is listed, it can be used (this assumes, that they are compatible).\r\n\r\nAre you talking about cast everytime `--help` to SASS, parse the output, get the options, strip the descriptions, check the arguments and create a whitelist of arguments to use? If I get this right (maybe not) this is tons of hours of work in order to obtain a fragile parser which is subject to brake up everytime the format of the help change. As far as I can see SASS changes a lot its formats, it come from `snake_style` arguments to `camelStyle` arguments. So I'll not going to put any effort to try to parse something that is written from a team of people that changes their mind so rapidly and make so much code break changes. Of course it's just my opinion\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/535264592/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/535265688","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1528#issuecomment-535265688","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/1528","id":535265688,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNTI2NTY4OA==","user":{"login":"ocafebabe","id":3409735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDk3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3409735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ocafebabe","html_url":"https://github.com/ocafebabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ocafebabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ocafebabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ocafebabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ocafebabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ocafebabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ocafebabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ocafebabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ocafebabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ocafebabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-25T23:35:22Z","updated_at":"2019-09-25T23:35:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> @ocafebabe I picked up your start of upgrading jgit and got all dependencies integrated, fixed all compile errors and parts of the unittest failures.

I assume this will override the nb-javac in that OK?\r\n3. Are there any implications for shipping an update to nb-javac if it proves necessary?\r\n4. @matthiasblaesing recently changed the OpenJFX setting for `AutoUpdate-Show-In-Client` to `true`.

Am I reading this right that it will continue to always install in the userdir even if the installation directory is writeable?  (I think it should)\r\n6. What are the feasibilities for actually moving this to Maven Central anyway?  That should be preferred if possible, and would be good to have the sources easily accessible alongside.

Yes, I believe we can keep the catalogs. These new modules have a newer version, so should be preferred.\r\n3. I think we can produce an update in general, but there will be a problem with such updates if we only have a single update center (like plugin portal) for multiple releases.

The nb-javac.api and nb-javac.impl modules are not shown in the UI, but the nb-javac module, which depends on them, is, and I believe that is correct (the user does not necessarily care about api/impl - they simply want \"nb-javac\" to be present).\r\n5.

I manually switched the nb-javac impl in current beta2 to the one that this patch does link to. But it does not work better than before.\r\n\r\nHow did you switch it to new impl\r\nIn order to change the nb-javac-impl and nb-javac-api jars you have to follow following steps\r\n\r\nFirst install nb-javac plugin and then restart NB\r\nAfter that stop NB and then you have to replace the jar files (whose address can be found written in netbeans About->help->User directory, for windows it is C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\NetBeans\\11.2-beta1 ) in that directory further go inside modules->ext there you can find the jars. replace the jar files with new downloaded jars( rename the downloaded jars by removing hash and removing -13- to match the name with old jars).\r\n\r\nThen go back to location - C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\NetBeans\\11.2-beta1\r\nyou can see .lastModified file, use following command there(from bash)\r\ntouch .lastModified\r\nThis will update the jars of nb-javac for netbeans\r\n\r\nI did the same and after that text blocks are working for me with base jdk of net beans as JDK8.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/538640043/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/538648025","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1547#issuecomment-538648025","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/1547","id":538648025,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzODY0ODAyNQ==","user":{"login":"graben","id":1685573,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODU1NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1685573?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/graben","html_url":"https://github.com/graben","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graben/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graben/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graben/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graben/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graben/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graben/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graben/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graben/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graben/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-05T13:04:15Z","updated_at":"2019-10-05T13:04:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I
