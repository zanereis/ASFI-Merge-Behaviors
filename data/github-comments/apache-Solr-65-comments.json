This made the test pass, but now the BATS test for PostTool started failing. Reason was that it used `SolrCli.getSolrClient(solrUrl)` to get its client for doing **commit**, with the full `http://localhost:8983/solr/mycollection` url as base URL. Which no longer works (should it?). So I modified PostTool to instead extract collection name from URL, get a clinent with baseURL and call `client.commit(myCollection)`.

Fixing the issues with slot borrowing has no impact at all on whether we're free to remove it, so if we want to remove it, we can do so in a follow-up PR. The only change that would make it more awkward to remove slot borrowing would be enabling different request types (since as long as only one request type is possible, slot borrowing has no practical effect. This PR has no effect on whether slot borrowing _works_, it just affects performance if/when it _does_ work).\r\n\r\nSo unless there are concerns with the substance of this PR (according to the scope of \"fix what's there and has demonstrable bugs\") I'll go ahead and merge this soon.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2203862777/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2204475187","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2545#issuecomment-2204475187","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2545","id":2204475187,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6DZZ8z","user":{"login":"epugh","id":22395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh","html_url":"https://github.com/epugh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-02T21:26:01Z","updated_at":"2024-07-02T21:26:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This is awesome.

We should be properly handling all URI to obey the stricket definition, and if we aren't, we should figure out why and fix it right?   I think the changes you've made here are right, and our testing should pick if there are other places that URI being stricter than URL causes an issue then we fix them as we go?    \r\n\r\nAt least as far as I know there aren't any special nuances that would cause problems, but again, I only know parts of Solr's code base!   I suppose if we had the ability to \"fuzz\" our inputs we could proactively test out all the variations of the old URL inputs to test them, but that feels like a major undertaking!

But something is still fishy.\r\n\r\nHard to reproduce in IntelliJ I believe, since this test fails due to the \"lock factory vs RAMDirectory\" issue. You could temporarily patch the tests's `solrconfig.xml` to using `MockDirectoryFactory` (which is set by gradle but not by IntelliJ), to have the test pass and be able to step through it. Probably need to pass some sys props to the test in IntellJ to reproduce the exact same condition..","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2232999853/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2233699262","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2536#issuecomment-2233699262","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2536","id":2233699262,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6FI4u-","user":{"login":"serba","id":449578,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0OTU3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/449578?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/serba","html_url":"https://github.com/serba","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serba/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serba/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serba/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serba/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serba/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serba/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serba/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serba/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serba/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-17T16:16:44Z","updated_at":"2024-07-17T16:16:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@dsmiley @mkhludnev Could you please guys merge this MR if you think it is ready?
