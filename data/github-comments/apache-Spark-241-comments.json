because in spark-v1.0.1, \"spark.default.parallelism\" is not considered in class LocalBackend, which is assigned to totalCores, and totalCores is derived from \"local[N]\". In spark-v1.0.1, if I want to increase the default parallelism(p), I should increase N in \"local[N]\", which increases the number(t) of tasks that can be launched in the only local executor, so \"spark.task.cpus\"(c) comes in. Finally, I make the equation: p-(t-1)+1 = c*2 , which will be true when the split factor is big enough. Be sure to refer to https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/v1.0.1/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/local/LocalBackend.scala\nBut, this bug is revised in the current master: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/local/LocalBackend.scala\n\nWe use \"local[N]\" in our production, so we paied more attention to

One assumption is that before a `TaskMetrics` is consumed downstream it is fully populated and no fields are missing that aren't `Option[T]`. Another is that a given TaskMetrics will only be mutated within one thread.\n\nFor the first issue, I think the right thing to do here is to distinguish between metrics that can be updated incrementally (`PartialTaskMetrics`) and other metrics. And the update should only send `PartialTaskMetrics` over the wire.\n\nYou'd have:\n\n```\nclass TaskMetrics extends PartialTaskMetrics {\n  // For sending updates to the driver\n  def asPartialMetrics = this.asInstanceOf[PartialTaskMetrics]\n}\n```\n\nYou could do likewise for `ShuffleWriteMetrics` or `ShuffleReadMetrics`. Then you'd very explicitly send partial data through the listener on the updates.\n\nFor synchronization, we might be \"just okay\" here for now since we are only mutating object references and integers. We had a few other ideas in that regard, but I think fixing the partial/full metrics issue first would be better.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49963097/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49963642","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1561#issuecomment-49963642","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1561","id":49963642,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5OTYzNjQy","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-24T03:26:07Z","updated_at":"2014-07-24T03:26:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA

Can that be called from multiple threads as-is? I wasn't aware of cases where we had multi-threaded access to `TaskMetrics` prior to this patch.\n\nTo your point, there are really only two fields here that are not just commutative counters - `hostname` and `shuffleFinishTime`. Is there is a race where `hosntame` gets sent over as null in a heartbeat and it triggers an NPE downstream? Maybe we should set `shuffleFinishTime` to -1 by default to indicate it's not populated.\n\nMy motivation for adding extra typing was to make it explicit for people extending TaskMetrics in the future. We already have some proposals for augmenting the `TaskMetrics` class and some of them add more complicated fields. Perhaps an alternative is just to document clearly in the class that we might take a snapshot of the TaskMetrics at any time and send it to consumers of the SparkListener interface.\n\nOver time, I'd actually hope these get re-implemented as accumulators...\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49975385/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49975753","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1420#issuecomment-49975753","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1420","id":49975753,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5OTc1NzUz","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-24T07:28:36Z","updated_at":"2014-07-24T07:28:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA tests have started for PR 1420.
