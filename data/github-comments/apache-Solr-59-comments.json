Since this is client-side solrj code, it could be in e.g. `solrj-aws-secret` instead?\r\n\r\nActually, this is a server side code.\r\nWhen Solr starts, it reads ZK creds from a local (clear) text file and uses them to connect to ZK. \r\nWith this feature, Solr would get the ZK creds from an AWS Secret Manager, and then proceed to connect to ZK.\r\n\r\nNow, from SolrJ side we have 3 options:\r\n- Use the existing mechanism. Get the ZK creds and set them in System Props using the standard way.\r\n- The client can connect to AWS SM to get the creds before passing them to System Props.\r\n- This module can be used to connect directly to AWS SM and inject the creds into SolrJ.

If no user/committer requests aws-cred handled by SolrJ client side, let's not do it. But if there is a need, then the module could be split in two, one client-only part and one server-side module that depends on the client-part.\r\n\r\nI thought of another issue with having different JDK requirements for solrj and core. When we do breaking upgrades of e.g. jetty on the server side, that same version of jetty-client will also be mandated on the client, even if client runs with JDK11. Guess it is a different but related issue. If we sometimes would like to ship SolrJ with an older jetty requirement for compatibility with Spring Framework or similar. That is harder to do though, as we'd likely need to have a separate gradble build for solrj and perhaps even  multiple releases like \"solrj-jetty10\" and \"solrj-jetty12\", where solr server includes the jetty12 variant...

It should fail prior to this PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2042659874/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2042815244","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2248#issuecomment-2042815244","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2248","id":2042815244,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM55wuMM","user":{"login":"cpoerschke","id":6458642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NTg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6458642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpoerschke","html_url":"https://github.com/cpoerschke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpoerschke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpoerschke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpoerschke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpoerschke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpoerschke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpoerschke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpoerschke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpoerschke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpoerschke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-08T13:50:35Z","updated_at":"2024-04-08T13:50:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> ... Couldn't we build segment level FixedBitSets (no safety issue) and then at the end combine into a master FixedBitSet so that we have our DocSet?

But after some investigations and debugging I realised this is only valid for a first-stage retrieval and scoring, and it's not usable in the reranking phase easily.\r\n\r\n2) Then I thought of using the ExitableDirectoryReader.ExitingReaderException mechanism, but following this approach, the solr document result list is emptied here:  org/apache/solr/handler/component/SearchHandler.java:440 when returning partial results. \r\nChanging those parts to align with the expectations here, looked invasive and didn't like the outcome\r\n\r\nSo I ended up with this solution, building on top of the SolrQueryTimeoutImpl from @dsmiley  past contribution.\r\nIt's decently clean and allowed me to mimic the same approach we have in 10.x and 9.x.\r\n\r\nHappy to gather some feedback, and unless any concern I'll proceed in a week to the merge on 9.1.x.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2049310875/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2049409176","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1821#issuecomment-2049409176","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1821","id":2049409176,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM56J4CY","user":{"login":"cpoerschke","id":6458642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NTg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6458642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpoerschke","html_url":"https://github.com/cpoerschke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpoerschke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpoerschke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpoerschke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpoerschke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpoerschke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpoerschke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpoerschke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpoerschke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpoerschke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-11T10:41:52Z","updated_at":"2024-04-11T10:41:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Wondering

Do you use it regularly @igiguere ? Have you found it to be pretty accurate? Any other folks have experience with it?\r\n\r\nMe, personally, no, I don't use it ;).  I'll try to find out from client-facing people in the company.  I doubt anyone has compiled usage vs success statistics.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: I couldn't find anyone who really used `size-estimator-lucene-solr.xls` or the clusterzising feature (v1).  So of course, nobody has any clue about accuracy.\r\n \r\n> ... the community's only response to sizing questions has always been pretty much \"You'll have to Guess-and-Check\".\r\n\r\nThe cluster sizing feature is documented to estimate (i.e.: guess) resource usage.  We could make the documentation clearer that it's not a fool-proof measure.  But, at least it beats holding a finger to the wind.  And it's a bit less complicated that the xls and a calculator.\r\n\r\n> And secondarily, because the spreadsheet this is all based off of was added in 2011 and hasn't really seen much iteration in the decade since. There's an absolute ton that's changed in both Lucene and Solr since then.\r\n\r\nWe're only calculating RAM, disk size, document size.  Whatever has changed in Solr and Lucene, if it has an effect on RAM, disk space, doc size, then it should be reflected on the results... No?\r\n\r\nNote that this feature is meant to be used on a current \"staging\" deployment, to evaluate the eventual size of a \"production\" environment, for the same version of Solr.  No one is expected to draw conclusions from a previous version, so changes from one version to another are not a concern in that way.\r\n\r\nAs a more general note, I should add that I'm a linguist converted to Java dev.  Not a mathematician ;)  If there's an error in the math, I will never see it.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2050511702/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2050664409","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2364#issuecomment-2050664409","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2364","id":2050664409,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM56OqfZ","user":{"login":"dsmiley","id":377295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzI5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/377295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley","html_url":"https://github.com/dsmiley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-11T22:33:23Z","updated_at":"2024-04-11T22:33:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks
