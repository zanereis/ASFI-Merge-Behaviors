If anyone wants to have a look, this is my approach:\r\n\r\n- check the two commits, that brought in the donations: 7c9326139ffcd06e4e65130153e4a8a233eb6398 and 17624e153c7979d69f14207a588987e7bd48c1c6\r\n- ensure that the commits have either exactly one parent (normal commit with new files) or no parent (orphan branch)\r\n- ensure that only files were added\r\n- ensure that all added files can be found either in donation4 or donation4.5\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>I decided to write that down in java using jgit, feel free to use `CheckApacheNetBeansDonation.java` (Expand to see)</summary>\r\n\r\n```java\r\npackage jgit;\r\n\r\nimport java.io.Closeable;\r\nimport java.io.File;\r\nimport java.io.IOException;\r\nimport java.io.InputStream;\r\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\r\nimport java.util.Arrays;\r\nimport java.util.List;\r\nimport java.util.zip.ZipEntry;\r\nimport java.util.zip.ZipFile;\r\nimport org.eclipse.jgit.internal.storage.file.FileRepository;\r\nimport org.eclipse.jgit.lib.ObjectId;\r\nimport org.eclipse.jgit.lib.ObjectLoader;\r\nimport org.eclipse.jgit.lib.ObjectReader;\r\nimport org.eclipse.jgit.lib.Repository;\r\nimport org.eclipse.jgit.revwalk.RevCommit;\r\nimport org.eclipse.jgit.revwalk.RevWalk;\r\nimport org.eclipse.jgit.treewalk.AbstractTreeIterator;\r\nimport org.eclipse.jgit.treewalk.CanonicalTreeParser;\r\nimport org.eclipse.jgit.treewalk.EmptyTreeIterator;\r\nimport org.eclipse.jgit.treewalk.TreeWalk;\r\n\r\npublic class CheckApacheNetBeansDonation {\r\n\r\n    private static final String[] commits = new String[]{\r\n\t\"7c9326139ffcd06e4e65130153e4a8a233eb6398\",\r\n\t\"17624e153c7979d69f14207a588987e7bd48c1c6\"\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {\r\n\tRepository repository = new FileRepository(\"/home/matthias/src/netbeans/.git\");\r\n\tfor (String commitId : commits) {\r\n\t    System.out.println(\"Commit: \" + commitId);\r\n\t    try ( RevWalk walk = new RevWalk(repository);  ObjectReader or = repository.newObjectReader();  DonationZips dz = new DonationZips()) {\r\n\r\n\t\tdz.addDonationZip(\"/home/matthias/archiv/netbeans/ApacheDonation4.zip\", \"ApacheDonation4/\");\r\n\t\tdz.addDonationZip(\"/home/matthias/archiv/netbeans/ApacheDonation4.5.zip\", \"ApacheDonation4.5/\");\r\n\r\n\t\tRevCommit commit = walk.parseCommit(ObjectId.fromString(commitId));\r\n\t\tRevCommit parent = null;\r\n\t\tif (commit.getParentCount() == 1) {\r\n\t\t    parent = commit.getParent(0);\r\n\t\t} else if (commit.getParentCount() != 0) {\r\n\t\t    throw new IllegalStateException(\"Only non-merge commits are supported!\");\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\tAbstractTreeIterator commitTree = getCanonicalTreeParser(repository, commit);\r\n\t\tAbstractTreeIterator parentTree = null;\r\n\t\tif (parent != null) {\r\n\t\t    parentTree = getCanonicalTreeParser(repository, parent);\r\n\t\t} else {\r\n\t\t    parentTree = new EmptyTreeIterator();\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\ttry ( TreeWalk tw = new TreeWalk(repository)) {\r\n\t\t    tw.setRecursive(true);\r\n\t\t    tw.addTree(parentTree);\r\n\t\t    tw.addTree(commitTree);\r\n\t\t    while (tw.next()) {\r\n\t\t\tObjectId parentObjectId = tw.getObjectId(0);\r\n\t\t\tObjectId commitObjectId = tw.getObjectId(1);\r\n\t\t\tif (parentObjectId.equals(ObjectId.zeroId())) {\r\n\t\t\t    checkContentsInDonationZip(or, commitObjectId, tw.getPathString(), dz);\r\n\t\t\t} else if (commitObjectId.equals(ObjectId.zeroId())) {\r\n\t\t\t    //System.out.println(\"Removed:  \" + tw.getPathString());\r\n\t\t\t    throw new IllegalStateException(\"Found Removal\");\r\n\t\t\t} else if (!parentObjectId.equals(commitObjectId)) {\r\n\t\t\t    //System.out.println(\"Modified: \" + tw.getPathString());\r\n\t\t\t    throw new IllegalStateException(\"Found Modification\");\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t    }\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t    }\r\n\t}\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private static void checkContentsInDonationZip(ObjectReader or, ObjectId objectId, String path, DonationZips dz) throws IOException {\r\n\tbyte[] donatedData = dz.getData(path);\r\n\tif(donatedData == null) {\r\n\t    throw new IOException(\"Not found in donation: \" + path);\r\n\t}\r\n\tObjectLoader ol = or.open(objectId);\r\n\tif(!

Should there be one, please add a utility method to extract `URI` from an `Image`.\r\n\r\nLet's get a little philosophical (there are more hints to use URL, so let's sort that in one place). The goal is to provide an ID. And there are images that one cannot get the physical bits. Most importantly the images in the `UIDefaults`, but possibly other ones as well. \r\nThe distinction between URI and URL is that the URI is really an **identifier** ... which sometimes might be the **location** at the same time (URL). But some URIs are not (= URN). The most important functional distinction is that URL allows to locate the physical resource = access its bits. That's what `URLStreamHandler`s are for.\r\n\r\nI don't have the bits for images from UIDefaults. They can be forged, by painting the Icon + encoding as PNG, for example - then the special URL with an associated `URLStreamHandler` instance could eventually work. But such URLs would not be usable anywhere - an attempt to pass them around will eventually lead to .toString() and back - which will fail, since the protocol would not be probably registered - and the referenced bits are ephemeral.\r\n\r\nI can invent an additional protocol, 'uidefaults' and register a handler for it that would access the LaF (authority) icon/image (path). But still the resource's content would be computed. Allowing for URIs does not preclude that, but allows true identifiers for ephemeral objects. So IMHO there should have been URIs from the start - so that the image was not required to be a locatable, but just identifiable.\r\n\r\nDoes that explain the introduction - does it seem acceptable ?

When `pseudoURL.open*()` throw an exception, you can't really know (if there's a mix of real+ephemeral URLs), if something broke or you just hit the ephemeral one, for example. If ever someone prints fakeURL.toString() and will try to convert it back, an exception is likely (handler not registered). fakeURL.toURI() will work, but fakeURL.toURI().toURL() will fail.

What is the correct way to merge these and ensure proper credit (i.e. Mattias changes) get recorded in the history?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1008333123/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1008345128","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/3433#issuecomment-1008345128","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/3433","id":1008345128,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M48GiAo","user":{"login":"vieiro","id":564140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NDE0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/564140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro","html_url":"https://github.com/vieiro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-09T17:55:51Z","updated_at":"2022-01-09T18:49:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"D'oh, on a Java 11 build we get...\r\n\r\n```\r\n[repeat] /home/travis/build/apache/netbeans/dlight/dlight.remote.ui/src/org/netbeans/modules/remote/api/ui/FileChooserUIImpl.java:139: error: package sun.awt.shell does not exist\r\n[repeat] import sun.awt.shell.ShellFolder;\r\n[repeat]                     ^\r\n[repeat] /home/travis/build/apache/netbeans/dlight/dlight.remote.ui/src/org/netbeans/modules/remote/api/ui/FileChooserUIImpl.java:140: error: package sun.swing does not exist\r\n[repeat] import sun.swing.FilePane;\r\n```\r\n\r\n> But I'm ready, yes, I'm ready for you\r\n> I'm standing on my own two feet\r\n> Out of the doorway the bullets rip\r\n> Repeating to the sound of the beat\r\n> Another one bites the dust\r\n> And another one gone, and another one gone\r\n> Another one bites the dust\r\n> **Hey, I'm gonna get you, too**\r\n> **Another one bites the dust**\r\n> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY0WxgSXdEE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1008345128/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1008358723","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/3427#issuecomment-1008358723","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/3427","id":1008358723,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M48GlVD","user":{"login":"entlicher","id":5479271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NzkyNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5479271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/entlicher","html_url":"https://github.com/entlicher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/entlicher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/entlicher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/entlicher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/entlicher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/entlicher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/entlicher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/entlicher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/entlicher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/entlicher/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-09T19:23:14Z","updated_at":"2022-01-09T19:23:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> `getSourceFileURI` should probably return an actual URI.

In that commit you see, that you are referenced as the author and I'm referenced as the committer, which is correct for this case.\r\n\r\nTo get this PR onto the current master state, this is what I would do:\r\n\r\n1. Ensure your own repository is registered as a remote with the name `origin`\r\n2. Ensure the apache netbeans repository is registered as a remove with the name `github`\r\n\r\nThat will result in this (adapt the names for you):\r\n\r\n```\r\nmatthias@enterprise:~/src/netbeans$ git remote -v\r\ngithub\tgit@github.com:apache/netbeans.git (fetch)\r\ngithub\tgit@github.com:apache/netbeans.git (push)\r\norigin\tgit@github.com:matthiasblaesing/netbeans.git (fetch)\r\norigin\tgit@github.com:matthiasblaesing/netbeans.git (push)\r\nmatthias@enterprise:~/src/netbeans$\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Update your local copy of the master branch `git fetch github`\r\n4. Fetch my branch:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Checkout the base commit of my branch (this is where my branch an master diverge)\r\ngit checkout -b blaesing-sql_autocomplete_clean f6634f96135ccd5aeae12c68e3f17d4bba268419\r\n# Pull the commits from my branch into the freshly created branch\r\ngit pull https://github.com/matthiasblaesing/netbeans.git pr-3074\r\n```\r\n\r\n5. Checkout your work branch `git checkout sql_autocomplete_clean`\r\n6. Rebase it onto current master by running  `git rebase github/master`\r\n7. To squash the last two commits together, run `git rebase -i HEAD~2`. An editor window will open, where the two commits will be shown and where you can now change history (literally). The comment below the history gives info what you can do. You want to change `pick` in the second line to `f` (short for fixup). This will squash the second commit into the first and only the commit message of the first commit will be retained. Save and exit the editor.\r\n8. git will now tell you, that the rebase was successful\r\n\r\nAt this point the changes from this PR are on on top of the current state of master and squashed into a single commit.\r\n\r\n9. Find the commit ID of my commit by running `git log -n 5 --oneline blaesing-sql_autocomplete_clean` (show the last 5 commits from my branch, the first is the right one)\r\n10. Cherry pick that commit into your branch `git cherry-pick c5173486d454`\r\n11. This introduces a merge conflict in `ide/db/apichanges.xml` and `ide/db/nbproject/project.properties`. Open the `apichanges.xml` file, move the new entry to the top and fix the XML structure, save and exit the editor. Please also change the minor version of the change to 83. For the `ide/db/nbproject/project.properties` retain the newer spec version.\r\n12. Mark the conflicts as fixed: `git add ide/db/apichanges.xml ide/db/nbproject/project.properties`\r\n13.
