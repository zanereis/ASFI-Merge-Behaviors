Just wanted to add a couple of notes on questions you had above:\n\n> @YolandaMDavis, what happens if an incoming FlowFile, FileVariableRegistry and custom EL attributes all have the same key? Is there any ordering enforced? From looking at the code, I believe it to be random.\n\nThe order is dictated through the MultiMap's (now ImmutableMultiMap) use of an ArrayList internally which maintains the order in which a map was added to that list.  In the case you mentioned where the same key name appears across a flow file, file/property registry etc the first map encountered in the ImmutableMultiMap's list with that value will be used.\n\nWhen the variable registry is initialized via VariableRegistryUtils (as it is in most of the application) environment variables and java application properties are added first, with those values taking precedence.  \n\nThe details of this will be added to the admin guide (which I believe is part of another issue on Jira list, but I can confirm).\n\n**UPDATE**\nConcerning documentation couldn't find an existing Jira. However since this has already been merged into 0.x perhaps another separate ticket could be used for updating the admin guide?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/235481613/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/235631120","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/695#issuecomment-235631120","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/695","id":235631120,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNTYzMTEyMA==","user":{"login":"JPercivall","id":11302527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzAyNTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11302527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall","html_url":"https://github.com/JPercivall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-27T15:55:13Z","updated_at":"2016-07-27T15:55:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hey @brosander, just went through the license/notice and deps, most of it looks good for the new assembly but I had a few comments.

For example, I can run some of the scripts, and `./caCliClient.sh` with no arguments will provide a help message, but `./certs.sh` with no arguments provides no output, exits successfully, and has generated new files.)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/235744695/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/235763878","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/695#issuecomment-235763878","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/695","id":235763878,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNTc2Mzg3OA==","user":{"login":"alopresto","id":798465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODQ2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/798465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto","html_url":"https://github.com/alopresto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-28T00:34:09Z","updated_at":"2016-07-28T00:34:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I don't really understand the structure of the tool here -- it looks like `TlsToolkitMain` is invoked from the scripts, and it has an internal instance of `TlsToolkitCommandLine` to parse the command line arguments, and an instance of `TlsHelper`. I would expect `TlsToolkitMain` to be a standalone class which encapsulated the logic (and ideally, to be named something like `CertificateGeneratorTool` as it is focusing solely on the key and certificate generation), and `TlsToolkitCommandLine` to be a wrapper class which handles and parses command line input to then invoke the main class logic. This way, the logic could be invoked programmatically from other classes with direct parameter provision. It seems to me that the current structure tightly couples all certificate generation & keystore population the with command line entry point. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/235763878/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/235769619","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/695#issuecomment-235769619","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/695","id":235769619,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNTc2OTYxOQ==","user":{"login":"brosander","id":596137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NjEzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/596137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brosander","html_url":"https://github.com/brosander","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brosander/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brosander/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brosander/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brosander/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brosander/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brosander/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brosander/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brosander/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brosander/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-28T01:15:03Z","updated_at":"2016-07-28T01:15:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@alopresto I agree with your concerns about the different entry points, I'll try to unify them and get down to a single shell script with the main method and argument parsing determining the action\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/235769619/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/235794420","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/688#issuecomment-235794420","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/688","id":235794420,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNTc5NDQyMA==","user":{"login":"ijokarumawak","id":1107620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak","html_url":"https://github.com/ijokarumawak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-28T03:55:27Z","updated_at":"2016-07-28T03:55:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@markap14 Thanks for fixing this.

(In both scenarios the user is a part of the \"query provenance\" policy)\n\nFirst when a user doesn't have \"Modify the data\" on a component on one node, it will correctly deny any replay requests that are of events that originated on that node. That said, if an event that originated on another node is submitted for replay it will succeed.\n\nA potential problem with \"View the data\" comes about when one node doesn't have the \"view the data\" policy but the others do and you attempt to query provenance. As a user I would expect the most strict policy (deny) to be merged and I would not be able to \"View the data\" from any node. Unfortunately the way it works currently (I believe) is that the query gets sent to the node to vet and it will take into account any policies and return the events. Then the events are merged. This means that the user will be able to see events from the allowing nodes. I'm not sure there is currently a way to merge these properly/effectively.\n\n@mcgilman may have more insight.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/236319211/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/236328868","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/529#issuecomment-236328868","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/529","id":236328868,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNjMyODg2OA==","user":{"login":"ijokarumawak","id":1107620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak","html_url":"https://github.com/ijokarumawak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-30T01:03:14Z","updated_at":"2016-07-30T01:03:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Where can I found the reopen button?
