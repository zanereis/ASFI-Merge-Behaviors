You already break the big problem, that is supporting grouping sets, into small ones including supporting the syntax. I mean, we should do more important and core work first. I think that this tradition is commonly shared by many development projects. When we develop something, we first design the whole architecture, and then break it into several modules. After that, we implement core modules first because trivial modules are not anythings without the core ones.\n\nOn opening the legacy code, it may be helpful as you said. However, whether the legacy code exists or not,  we should adopt an efficient algorithm. To do so, we should investigate many other projects and papers, and then discuss them.
