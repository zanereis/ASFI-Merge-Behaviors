LoadManager considers multiple variables in split-bundle strategy (eg: msgRate, totalSession, bandwidth). So, I may not want to split bundle if it has 5K topics but has very less traffic and in other usecase, I may want to split bundle if it has <1K topics but has large traffic consistently which requires high resources from broker. So, shouldn't we avoid creating multiple bundles upfront but we should decide bundle-splitting based on resources that bundle requires.?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/367093666/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/367100096","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/1253#issuecomment-367100096","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/1253","id":367100096,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NzEwMDA5Ng==","user":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-20T19:57:41Z","updated_at":"2018-02-20T19:57:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@rdhabalia I think the tradeoff here is whether you pay the penalty of spitting bundles at creation time or at runtime.

Eg: when doing `pulsar-admin namespaces` that dumps the whole list of commands with all the options. \r\n\r\nI agree that here `Operations about brokers` doesn't really add much context over the `brokers` subcommand name.\r\n\r\nBut for example, at the 2nd level it would be good to hide all subcommands options, though keeping the subcommand description. \r\n\r\nEg: if I run `pulsar-admin namespaces` I get a long list of sub-sub-commands, many of which might be a bit cryptical. (Even current doc is very terse.. but that's a separate story).\r\n\r\nWhen running that command, I think it would be good to have a list of sub-command with brief description. \r\n```\r\n    list      Get the namespaces for a property\r\n    list-cluster      Get the namespaces for a property in a cluster\r\n    destinations      Get the destinations for a namespace\r\n    policies      Get the
