These may or may not be problems, so I just wanted to open them for discussion.\r\n\r\n1. This will reinstall the same templates each time indexing is started.  This may unexpectedly overwrite changes made by the user to their index templates.  \r\n\r\n    Many of the other install actions use a file as an indicator so that it only performs the action once.  Maybe you could do that too?\r\n\r\n2. If Elasticsearch is not running, then the Indexing topology will fail to start.  While normally this is probably OK, it might not be a dependency that we want to introduce.  What if someone has configured their topology to not write to ES and is using an alternative indexing destination?\r\n\r\n    What if you made it so that the topology could still start, even if Elasticsearch is not available?  Maybe a \"best effort\" to install the templates, but if it fails, move on.

@ottobackwards , made the change to remove the ES template installation from 'load_web_template' role for vagrant deployments. Fired up full-dev with the change and it comes up fine. Was able to launch and view alerts in the UI.\r\n\r\nHi @nickwallen - sure, what you are saying makes sense to me. To address point 1, I have moved the ES template installation step into the Indexing \"Install\" method, so this would be called only once. This would also not meddle with users making customization to the templates subsequently. \r\n\r\nPoint 2 is partly addressed with the recent commit in that it takes care of ES service not running scenario. However I am not sure about how we need to proceed with a user _not_ using Elasticsearch at all. If I have understand right, this is something that would require changes and considerations to packaging and installation, not limited to this pull request alone. Please correct me if I am missing something.

for looking at this again Nick, let me try to answer your questions.\r\n\r\nTL;DR\r\n--------\r\n I'm sorry for my confusion with your original statement.  I had in mind this part of @mattf-horton 's email on these pull requests:\r\n\r\n> The first PR will be just the “bundle” mechanism and the maven plugin. \r\n> Both are adaptations from the Apache NiFi project, and have already been \r\n> reviewed as part of PR# 530. Review is acknowledged to be purely \r\n> theoretical, and testing is based on the junit tests and integration \r\n> tests.\r\n\r\nI thought an example project to look at would answer your question, not that you actually wanted to do it, or have instructions to do it.  Especial since you didn't say \"the readme should have better instructions for creating a project that uses the plugin\".\r\n\r\nWhile creating bundles by hand is not in the initial use case, if you feel it is important I'll write a readme.\r\n\r\n---------\r\n \r\n\r\nAs with the NiFi version of the maven plugin, the 100% use case in practice ( and for initial dev in metron ) is to have bundles create as part of the archetype project generation.  When I 'adapted' the maven plugin, which consisted of adding the ability to rename the extension of the product and change the metadata prefixes, I did not make changes to the documentation of the plugin beyond documenting my changes.  I also did not attempt to add maven test harness support for the plugin, as it was not present in the original project.  Thus, the create by hand scenario for our version is as lacking as the create by hand scenario is in the origin nifi project.  I tried to avoid changing the plugin as much as possible, as it is already in use in NiFi.\r\n\r\nAs we had discussed in the threads and the meetings, this initial PR would contain the plugin and the bundle, and the practical testing would be limited.  I created and added reference to the test project because it is a simple example of a project that utilizes the plugin to create a bundle.  I did this as opposed to writing out a step by step guide to how to create a multi module maven project, as I mistakenly thought this would be helpful given the context of the review.  \r\n\r\n@mattf-horton, would it be possible for you to help us with a comment as to your approach when you reviewed this functionality?  It might help if you could summarize your feelings as well.  The context is different, as the review within 777 could not be a +1 for the PR since this was only part of the total, but since you are the only one to have had reviewed this, your views are pretty

 says:\r\n> would it be possible for you to help us with a comment as to your approach when you reviewed this functionality? It might help if you could summarize your feelings as well\r\n\r\n{with music}\r\nOh spelunking we shall go, spelunking we shall go... :-)\r\n{with music}\r\n\r\nWhile reviewing the original incarnation of this, I tried to focus on the part most other Metron community members wouldn't be familiar with, the NiFi Bundle implementation, which I have some (small) experience with due to past work with NiFi.  The review I did was an eyeball line-by-line code review.  Of course actually running the code is also necessary, and at the time @mmiklavc  was focusing on that side of things.\r\n\r\nKnowing that (a) the NiFi feature works in NiFi, and (b) Otto's intent was to change it as little as possible while porting it into Metron, I took an approach to reviewing it that focused on the **changes.**  Specifically, as best I remember, I applied the following logic:\r\n* I pulled a copy of the version of NiFi that Otto used as a base\r\n* I pulled a copy of Otto's dev branch (submitted in PR #530)\r\n* I observed relationships between directory paths of corresponding files (code organization relationships) in the two code sets, including filename changes (which were mostly pattern-based)\r\n* I applied \"diff -w\" to corresponding file pairs\r\n* I reviewed THAT as the code deltas of interest, the way we would code review a simple PR based on master\r\n* I also reviewed in detail the small number of newly created files, and missing/deleted files, compared to the related NiFi sources\r\n* I mapped my questions and remarks back to the submitted code in Otto's PR #530, and made the usual comments in that PR\r\n* We interacted and followed up as usual.\r\n\r\nAfter many days and some untold number of comments, responses, and changes, I felt I understood and agreed with the state of the code, and gave it a +1 here: https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/530#issuecomment-322970038 ,\r\ncontingent on the practical trials being completed.\r\n\r\nNow, we've changed gears a bit.  Faced with the difficulty of trying to review the offering all at once, whether in a PR or in a \"feature branch\" (turned out that wasn't much help after all), @ottobackwards and I proposed, and you'all accepted, the idea of breaking it up into five or so chunks.  This was specified in my email to dev@metron.apache.org, 25 Sep 2017, Subject: _Re: feature branch bumps_ (see http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/metron-dev/201709.mbox/browser , Thread view, page 2, about 3/4 way down the page).\r\n\r\nIt was specifically called out that for the first chunk, consisting of just the “bundle” mechanism and the maven plugin,\r\n> \"Review is acknowledged to be purely theoretical, and testing is based on the junit tests and integration tests.  We’ll add a simple integration test with a synthetic test jar containing a trivial\r\nClass, unrelated to parsers, invoked in a test case via reflection (hence needing no glue\r\ncode).  After passing that level of review and testing, it would be committed, with an understanding that additional revisions might be required as the result of subsequent PR comments.\r\n\r\nSo on the one hand, we agreed to a fairly light-weight review process, since by the nature of a piece-wise submission, the first part can't be tested on parsers.  I encourage you to stick with that resolve.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the simple integration test suggested does call for being able to see a \"hello-world\" Stellar command loaded and run from a bundle, which actually would be kinda exciting.\r\n\r\n@ottobackwards , can your test bundle be turned into a Stellar function, loaded, and invoked (by reflection so you don't need to worry about registration)?  That would look more like an integration test than that bundle hanging out by itself.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/340042799/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/340049064","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/774#issuecomment-340049064","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/774","id":340049064,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MDA0OTA2NA==","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-27T18:27:07Z","updated_at":"2017-10-27T18:27:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @ottobackwards  hopefully the Readme changes help.\r\n\r\nThe Getting Started information that you added to the README is outstanding!

In this case, we have an issue where validate is forcing us into that condition and we don't have a default, so it is an error.\r\nI'll keep looking.  \r\nIf you have any thoughts, or maybe @cestella  does, I'm all ears.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/340231595/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/340232295","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/814#issuecomment-340232295","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/814","id":340232295,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MDIzMjI5NQ==","user":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-29T02:04:51Z","updated_at":"2017-10-29T02:04:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"So for example:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n /*\r\n          curr is the current value on the stack.

This resolves the test issues, save for one where there is no default and we are using == true.  This is more difficult.\r\n\r\nI feel as if all of these things are wrong, because the validation by executing with null variables is itself logically wrong.  We have discussed this before, but this is really evident here.  At least I feel it is.  \r\n\r\nI think that we should use compilation instead of validation.  We can decide to make it a separate option when running tests, or to make it the way we do all tests etc.  But if compilation does what I think it does, then I think it is more correct.\r\n\r\nI would like to do that, and remove the work around I have introduced here ( basically detecting that we are validating and have a single var that is null because of validation ) since changing validation would be the real complete

I wanted to have a vigorous discussion, because this change has some pros and cons.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, as Nick alluded, we do template install upon index topology start.  The problem is that we cannot depend on ES starting prior to the indexing topology due to us not having a hard dependency listed there in the [role_command_order.json](https://github.com/cestella/incubator-metron/blob/e83390a39910903ccba313a7a1b00433bf347058/metron-deployment/packaging/ambari/metron-mpack/src/main/resources/addon-services/METRON/CURRENT/role_command_order.json).  The reason why, I believe, is because we don't assume that users are using ES managed via ambari necessarily.\r\n\r\nAll this to say that there may be a failure to start the indexing topology upon startup, which would necessitate a restart of the indexing topology to retry template install.  The downside to what we are doing currently, though, is that a warning is hidden in logs that users probably wont' see.  They will see green lights and the UI may or may not work (probably not).  This will get worse in ES 5, because without those templates, tuples will fail.\r\n\r\nSo, my question to you guys, is there sufficient value in failing fast here given the broader context.  I think so, but I want everyone to realize that we may end up in a situation where indexing fails to start becuase of an ordering problem with ES.\r\n\r\nI will not push this through without discussion, so I'd like at least 2 +1's from committers and a week of discussion before a commit happens.

I think the core abstraction issue is that we're doing ES-specific things in the indexing section.  We probably want to decouple indexing from ES a bit and have a separate component for ES configuration installation.  This also might not be something we want to do as part of ambari, but rather the installation of templates might should be done upon parser start time.  This might bear rethinking is what I'm saying.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I think I'm still more uncomfortable with a masked failure like we have it now.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/342523503/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/342529243","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/828#issuecomment-342529243","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/828","id":342529243,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MjUyOTI0Mw==","user":{"login":"cestella","id":540359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella","html_url":"https://github.com/cestella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-07T15:59:34Z","updated_at":"2017-11-07T15:59:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Dig. +1 by inspection","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/342529243/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/342531373","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/833#issuecomment-342531373","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/833","id":342531373,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MjUzMTM3Mw==","user":{"login":"lvets","id":4215920,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTU5MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4215920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvets","html_url":"https://github.com/lvets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-07T16:05:41Z","updated_at":"2017-11-07T16:05:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I don't know whether my +1 is actually relevant, but here it goes: +1.

Possibly after the ambari flow.\r\n\r\n- we should be able to install metron without installing and configuring any 'demo' system or parsers at all\r\n- we should be able to manage and install templates \r\n- templates are part of any parser configuration and should be managed and deployed with the parsers ( ie. 'create an deploy an es template is on the list of what you need to do for a production parser so it goes with the parser workflow')\r\n- we shouldn't lay down default configurations for the 'demo' parsers\r\n- the demo system should be managed outside main code ( ie. the bro.json files configured with the geo enrichments etc should be separate than what is installed by default)\r\n- the demo system should be a separate installable option\r\n- all the ES/KIBANA/SOLR issues with mpack etc\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/342560152/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
