Looking at the checkpoint coordinator more deeply, I think we firstly have to work a bit more on design for this kind of change. We have to take into account at least the following points (roughly):\r\n- Introduce the separate component/class responsible for failure management, counting e.g. `CheckpointFailureManager` or something\r\n- Job manager should \r\n    - construct `CheckpointFailureManager`\r\n    - configure with the max failure count and a proper action how to fail.\r\n    - pass it to `CheckpointCoordinator`\r\n- `CheckpointCoordinator`\r\n    - should give callbacks to `CheckpointFailureManager` about failures and successes of checkpoints\r\n    - needs some refactoring to distinguish better failures of `PendingCheckpoint`. Now it is `abortXXX()` methods which do not provide enough information to count it as a failure for `CheckpointFailureManager` or not (like we have for `triggerSavepoint` in `CheckpointDeclineReason`). At the end there should be clear place in the `CheckpointCoordinator` where to give callbacks to `CheckpointFailureManager`, e.g.:\r\n        - `CheckpointDeclineReason.EXCEPTION` result of `triggerSavepoint`\r\n        - some cases of `PendingCheckpoint.abortDeclined()`, `abortError()`, maybe `abortExpired()`\r\n- Consider having only `DecliningCheckpointExceptionHandler` on `TaskExecutor` side and letting now to handle all failure cases only in `CheckpointCoordinator`\r\n\r\nThere might be more points. I suggest we step back and continue discussion in the jira issue. Once we have clear design, a PR can be opened again.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/423573937/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/423611672","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6729#issuecomment-423611672","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6729","id":423611672,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMzYxMTY3Mg==","user":{"login":"tisonkun","id":18818196,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4ODE4MTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18818196?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun","html_url":"https://github.com/tisonkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-21T17:22:18Z","updated_at":"2018-09-21T17:22:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"cc

context may make my line of thinking easier to understand:\r\n\r\nThe hadoop-shaded module is a convenience artifact, one where we discussed previously to phase it out eventually. It is used (1) to compile against (for HDFS / YARN / Kerberos code) and (2) to add as a jar to the lib folder.\r\n\r\n  - Concerning a general exclusion tor the jdk.tools dependency: Since we don't compile Hadoop itself and we don't redistribute that dependency (it is a system dependency) I cannot see how a general exclusion would be a problem. It simplifies the build files, which is something really good.\r\n\r\n  - We should encourage use of HADOOP_CLASSPATH rather than use of our Hadoop fat jar anyways. That reduces the value of the second use of the hadoop-shaded  project, the packaging into the dist lib folder. If we purely go for the HADOOP_CLASSPATH variant, we could remove that project all together and simply have a provided or optional Hadoop dependency.\r\n\r\n  - The fat hadoop jar is used for client side functionality only, and since version 2, Hadoop claims to have a stable setup (HDFS protocol, Kerberos config, etc.) , so we don't need each major/minor version, but one of every major version should work. We should not need the vendor specific versions either. And, there is still the HADOOP_CLASSPATH workaround in case any of the vendor-specific versions has a compatibility problem after all.\r\n\r\n  - Concerning moving Hadoop to flink-shaded: We don't have to find a setup that converges across Hadoop versions, that is exactly the point. We pick some Hadoop versions for which we want to build convenience jars and converge these manually or by shading.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/424054104/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/424090397","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6738#issuecomment-424090397","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6738","id":424090397,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNDA5MDM5Nw==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-24T19:10:16Z","updated_at":"2018-09-24T19:10:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This fix seems to be a workaround for the real issue that the Scala API misses a DataSource type.\r\nI would suggest to see if that can be introduced without breaking the API.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/424090397/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/424092282","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6737#issuecomment-424092282","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6737","id":424092282,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNDA5MjI4Mg==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-24T19:16:25Z","updated_at":"2018-09-24T19:16:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"**Consensus that the contribution should go into to Flink**\r\n  -

Having exceptions that represent the categories and then making the specific exceptions subclasses of the category exceptions?\r\n\r\nThanks Stephan, use exception inheritance certainly a good way, however:\r\n- enum explicitly tell that there are four types of exceptions, while exception is more scattered. \r\n- Java doesn't support multi-inherits that will make subclasses a little harder but we can also use Java interface or Java annotation \r\n- There is a high level class need to consume this classification logic, so the ThrowableClassifier here is simply the logic, eg: if we use

@StephanEwen , Before providing the API directly, I evaluated the implementation of a peer `DataSource` in the flink-scala module. However, It will break the existing source API. It was found that `ExecutionEnvironment.scala` released some `readXXX` APIs that returned `DataSet.scala`. Inside these APIs, we got a `DataSource` (flink-java) and then called `wrap(source)` to convert it to a `DataSet.scala`. Considering that there are only two or three APIs exposed in the `DataSource.java` (one of which `withParameters` has been exposed through the `DataSet`), I chose to expose the API in the `DataSource` to the `DataSet.scala` with minimal changes and without breaking the current API. In fact, in this JIRA's description, reporter is more concerned with getting the APIs provided by `DataSource.java`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/424184780/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/424188954","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6710#issuecomment-424188954","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6710","id":424188954,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNDE4ODk1NA==","user":{"login":"XuQianJin-Stars","id":10494131,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDk0MTMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10494131?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars","html_url":"https://github.com/XuQianJin-Stars","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-25T02:42:09Z","updated_at":"2018-09-25T02:48:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I think we need to revisit the way this fix works.

Add an attribute to the read bom encoding logic to record the file bom encoding.For example: put it in the function `createInputSplits`.\r\n2.Regarding the second performance problem, you can use the previously generated bom code to judge UTF8 with bom, UTF16 wuth bom, UTF32 with bom, and control the byte size to process the end of each line, because I found The previous bug garbled is actually a coding problem, one is caused by improper processing of the end byte of each line. I have done the following for this problem:\r\n`String utf8 = \"UTF-8\";`\r\n`String utf16 = \"UTF-16\";`\r\n`String utf32 = \"UTF-32\";`\r\n`int stepSize = 0;`\r\n`String charsetName = this.getCharsetName();`\r\n`if (charsetName.contains(utf8)) {`\r\n​\t`stepSize = 1;`\r\n`} else if (charsetName.contains(utf16)) {`\r\n​\t`stepSize = 2;`\r\n`} else if (charsetName.contains(utf32)) {`\r\n​\t`stepSize = 4;`\r\n`}`\r\n`//Check if \\n is used as delimiter and the end of this line is a \\r, then remove \\r from the line`\r\n`if (this.getDelimiter() != null && this.getDelimiter().length == 1`\r\n​\t\t`&& this.getDelimiter()[0] == NEW_LINE && offset + numBytes >= stepSize`\r\n​\t\t`&& bytes[offset + numBytes - stepSize] == CARRIAGE_RETURN) {`\r\n​\t\t`numBytes -= stepSize;`\r\n`}`\r\n`numBytes = numBytes - stepSize + 1;`\r\n`return new String(bytes, offset, numBytes, this.getCharsetName());`\r\nThese are some of my own ideas. I hope that you can give some better suggestions and handle this jira better.

you.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/424565714/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/424618889","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6751#issuecomment-424618889","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6751","id":424618889,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNDYxODg4OQ==","user":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-26T07:46:17Z","updated_at":"2018-09-26T07:46:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've
