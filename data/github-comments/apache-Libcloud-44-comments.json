I have no idea.\r\n\r\nI've found no specification on that in the documentation (which currently is out of step with reality, as it states that _an access key is a 20 character alphanumeric string_).\r\n\r\nWhen I generate and revoke several access keys on my console, I always get 24 characters. I presume they no longer generate 20 characters keys, but that it would be safe to put an upper limit of say 30 (this is arbitrary).\r\n\r\nWe could try to contact Google to have the doc updated?\r\n\r\nPS. Tell me when it's good for you, and I squash the commits.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/451011392/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/451113328","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/1272#issuecomment-451113328","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/1272","id":451113328,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MTExMzMyOA==","user":{"login":"vdloo","id":1437341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzczNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1437341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdloo","html_url":"https://github.com/vdloo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdloo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdloo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdloo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdloo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdloo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdloo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdloo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdloo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdloo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-03T11:05:53Z","updated_at":"2019-01-03T11:05:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"yeah looks good, if you squash this I'll merge it","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/451113328/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/451227531","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/1272#issuecomment-451227531","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/1272","id":451227531,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MTIyNzUzMQ==","user":{"login":"MonsieurV","id":1753348,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTMzNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1753348?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsieurV","html_url":"https://github.com/MonsieurV","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsieurV/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsieurV/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsieurV/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsieurV/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsieurV/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsieurV/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsieurV/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsieurV/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsieurV/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-03T18:07:26Z","updated_at":"2019-01-03T18:07:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Done :ok_hand: ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/451227531/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/451404534","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/1272#issuecomment-451404534","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/1272","id":451404534,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MTQwNDUzNA==","user":{"login":"vdloo","id":1437341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzczNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1437341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdloo","html_url":"https://github.com/vdloo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdloo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdloo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdloo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdloo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdloo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdloo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdloo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdloo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdloo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-04T10:14:00Z","updated_at":"2019-01-04T10:14:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks!
