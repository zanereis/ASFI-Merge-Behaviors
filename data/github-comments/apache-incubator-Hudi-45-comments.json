Why do you want to have two different pipelines writing to the same destination path? \r\n\r\nIf you really want to have a backup to prevent any data loss, you can write to a separate path using spark data source and continue using DeltaStreamer to write to Hudi dataset. In case of any issues, you can always use CHECKPOINT_RESET_KEY to ingest the data from your back up path into your Hudi dataset path. We have support for kafka as well as DFS source for this purpose. \r\n\r\nAlso what is the source for your homebrew spark? If it is also consuming from kafka, then I do not see any case where using DeltaStreamer can result in data loss.

Few questions - \r\n\r\n1. If the kafka cluster retention time is too long, have you tried using BULK_INSERT mode of Hudi?If not, you can tune parameters around spark and Hudi to increase source limit and then ingest the data. Else you can also try using DeltaStreamer in continuous mode. \r\n2. Also I would like to know the reason behind switching everytime from homebrew spark to Hudi. Are you doing some POC on Hudi? Why don't you simply use DeltaStreamer and never switch to the other data source? The data loss will not happen if you simply rely on one of the data sources :) \r\n\r\nI am a bit skeptical of trying to use 2 pipelines to write to same destination path. Additionally we have options available for taking backup of your hudi dataset or for migrating existing dataset to Hudi.

Let's assume I am using delta streamer consuming DFS source, now I'd like to switch to delta streamer consuming Kafka source. The data arrive at DFS and Kafka is asynchronous.

If you have a good solution for this case please let me know. \r\n\r\n- The problem I have here is Kafka retention time is long but not long enough to cover all the data. All the raw data I have is in DFS and they are keep coming in. If I simply do BULK_INSERT from EARLIEST checkpoint from Kafka, I will lose data. If I do HDFS import first, then UPSERT from:\r\n   the EARLIEST checkpoint, it could eat up the resources of both my Spark cluster and Kafka cluster because the data volume is huge. \r\n   the LATEST checkpoint, I will lose data(30 mins gap). \r\n- There are some Hudi users are not using Delta Streamer in the first place and would like to switch to it later I believe. And I am one of them. Cause form a user perspective, I won't fully trust a framework until I fully understand and gain enough experience with it.   \r\n\r\nCurrently, I couldn't find a perfect way to switch to delta streamer cause:\r\nI need to make a non-deltastreamer commit to append the gap data into the Hudi dataset but this commit will let me lose the checkpoint. Let's not say this is a parallel pipeline cause it's confusing. This is a one-time thing to fix the data gap from two different sources and the delta streamer will be the only one to do the sink later.

When I was in the phase of adopting Hudi, I kept my already running pipeline writing to some path and started DeltaStreamer to write to some other path. Then I used to do validation everyday for some period of time to gain enough confidence on this framework before completely switching to Hudi. \r\n\r\nComing to your point of switching from Kafka -> HDFS raw parquet -> Hudi table to Kafka -> Hudi table, I was thinking of a similar use case some time back and the simplest thing I could think of was to support having checkpoints for Hudi dataset source wise. Currently we store checkpoint \"deltastreamer.checkpoint.key\" in .commit file and this variable stores checkpoint in a particular format for every source which creates problems when you try to switch your source for the same dataset. So I think if we could simply introduce more variables like this and each one of them will store checkpoints for their corresponding sources, this use case can be solved with minimal efforts. And yes this needs development cycle since what I am proposing is not supported as of now. WDYT? \r\n\r\nCurrently to handle such scenarios, we have \"deltastreamer.checkpoint.reset_key\" configurable for every DeltaStreamer run and you can do hacks around these two variables (\"deltastreamer.checkpoint.key\" and \"deltastreamer.checkpoint.reset_key\") to get your use case solved but a clean solution should be what I proposed above. The above solution works well in cases where you want to switch sources quite frequently also.\r\n\r\nAlso would like to hear from @leesf and @vinothchandar on this.

In order to use `deltastreamer.checkpoint.reset_key` I will need something like a `checkpointGenerator` mentioned above, otherwise it would be difficult to find the correct checkpoint for each table. I have a few hundreds of tables to manage so I do need a robust and trustworthy solution for the migration.\r\nAlso, I think it makes sense to give more options to the users to play around with the delta streamer for their own use cases.  \r\ne.g. \r\n- Allow the user to get checkpoint from commits older than the last commit(This PR)\r\n- Allow the user to get checkpoint from a specific commit\r\n- Allow the user to store checkpoint info in the commit metadata even if they are not using delta streamer. For example, when they are using HDFS importer or Spark Datasource writer to do the initial bulk_insert.\r\n- Maybe more ...\r\n\r\nWith though flexibility, I believe the user will be able to use the delta streamer in a more programmatically way. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/594767090/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/594772730","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/1368#issuecomment-594772730","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1368","id":594772730,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NDc3MjczMA==","user":{"login":"satishkotha","id":2992755,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTI3NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2992755?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishkotha","html_url":"https://github.com/satishkotha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishkotha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishkotha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishkotha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishkotha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishkotha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishkotha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishkotha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishkotha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishkotha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-04T19:23:46Z","updated_at":"2020-03-04T19:23:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@bvaradar updated AppendHandle as well.

This easily becomes a bottleneck as the driver spends time filtering out the files that it gets from `InMemoryFileIndex` as filtering is not distributed. My suggestion here is, at the time of ingestion we just return an `EmptyRelation` once **HoodieSparkSqlWriter** has done its job, because write now we end up creating a relation even at write time using parquet data source which is really not necessary for our use-case.
