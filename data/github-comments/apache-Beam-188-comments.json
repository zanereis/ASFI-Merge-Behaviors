ValidatesRunner is stalling reliably at HEAD; nothing to do with this PR. It may be infrastructure or pom or another issue. Certainly it is urgent, but I don't think this PR should wait on it. We have lots of assurances:\r\n\r\n - Jenkins did run WordCountIT and WindowedWordCountIT in precommit, so basic per key combines work\r\n - Building the new Dataflow worker involved testing akin to the Dataflow ValidatesRunner\r\n - I have since then manually run all of `CombineTest` on Dataflow\r\n - Other runners have compile time protection against this sort of change\r\n - I have manually run other runners' `ValidatesRunner` tests anyhow\r\n\r\nGiven the \"LGTM if tests pass\" I am going to merge this.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, all of this testing I've done against the merger of HEAD and
