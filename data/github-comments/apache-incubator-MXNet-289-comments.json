It seems as though the operator is slower (less optimized?) compared to handling dense matrix, at least on GPU. \r\n\r\nI don't have a simple example readily available, but you can take a look here https://github.com/dingran/nvdm-mxnet/blob/master/nvdm.ipynb\r\n\r\nIn cell [3], the flag `use_dense` controls whether to use sparse or dense matrix. Even counting the cost of converting mini batches of CSR into dense, the training speed when using dense matrix is still about 15~20% faster for this particular example. \r\n\r\nWould be good to have some benchmark between CSR and dense operators on CPU and GPU as guidelines (do we have them somewhere?)

You may refer to this PR for more information https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/9148.\r\n\r\nOne solution to this problem is to use Sequential or HybridSequential as a container of the Conv Layers. For example:\r\n```python\r\nclass Layer(nn.HybridBlock):\r\n    def __init__(self, depth=15, channels=3, **kwargs):\r\n        super(Layer, self).__init__(**kwargs)\r\n        self.conv_layers = nn.HybridSequential()\r\n        with self.conv_layers.name_scope():\r\n             for i in range(depth):\r\n                  self.conv_layers.add(nn.Conv2D(128, kernel_size=3, strides=1, padding=1, use_bias=True))\r\n   def hybrid_forward(self, F, x):\r\n       # You can use the layers as self.conv_layers[i]\r\n```\r\n\r\n@szha @piiswrong In PyTorch, there is an additional ModuleList object (http://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html#torch.nn.ModuleList) for this behavoir. Do you think we need to add this?

@dingran \r\nI just noticed that you're using gluon interface with sparse ndarray. Unfortunately this is not supported yet. The gluon interface will try to run all operators with dense data/weight/gradient if you hybridize it. You probably will observe storage fallback messages in your console/terminal. \r\n\r\nIf you don't hybridize the network, you can probably run it in imperative mode (I haven't verify it personally, so there's no guarantee that it works without any conversion between sparse and dense ndarrays..). Note that the `nn.Dense` layer uses `FullyConnected` operator, which doesn't support csr inputs (due to legacy operator interface that doesn't support sparse, we're fixing it). So it's actually converting everything into dense to perform the operation. Instead you can create a custom layer with sparse.dot operator which supports csr input to replace `nn.Dense` (note that the weight is transposed in FC though). \r\n\r\nGluon sparse support is on the roadmap. Currently the easiest way to use the sparse feature is still through the symbol interface (unfortunately)
