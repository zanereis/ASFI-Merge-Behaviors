- Thanks for the feedback.  The command line parsing package we use, cobra, has built in bash auto-completion support via an API that will generate the script.\n\nDistribution choices are:\n1. generate the script at build time and package it with the binary for download\n2. generate the script at build time and make the script a separate download\n3. silently generate the script (if the script has not already been generated) when the CLI is used\n4. generate the script on demand.\nPersonally, I like option 4 as the latest and correct script is always available with whatever version of the wsk binary you have.\n\nYeah.  Not exactly an sdk, but I like the idea of not introducing another subcommand.  Maybe `wsk sdk install bashauto` to remove any possible thought that we have a script based

FYI-- the mount options support in the `local` driver for **docker volume** command came in 1.11, so that's why the example doesn't work from current docs.\n\nRead-only seems like a good option for your use case with the available tmpfs as a \"relief valve\" for the cases that must have a writeable location. I can't remember if you are using user namespaces, but we had a restriction that the `--read-only` option on **docker run** conflicted with a daemon with user namespaces enabled (based on a Linux kernel restriction on remount of the fs as read-only). That problem is potentially resolved upstream, so this is a point in time statement.\n\nAs you noted, there has been work for quota support on some backends recently (ping @cpuguy83) so that may be a future option if there are more complexities found with the readonly path.\n\nIf memory is an issue, you can also create a \"real\" file mounted as a writeable temporary fs (loopback file mounted) as another option. The time cost would probably be higher than the memory option, but would save you the memory allocation (which I think as was noted above is only truly allocated if it's used)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/233670432/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/233673937","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/890#issuecomment-233673937","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/890","id":233673937,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMzY3MzkzNw==","user":{"login":"cpuguy83","id":799078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5OTA3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/799078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpuguy83","html_url":"https://github.com/cpuguy83","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpuguy83/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpuguy83/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpuguy83/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpuguy83/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpuguy83/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpuguy83/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpuguy83/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpuguy83/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpuguy83/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-19T15:40:40Z","updated_at":"2016-07-19T15:40:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"FYI, on 1.11: `docker volume create --name mytmpfs --opt type=tmpfs --opt device=tmpfs --opt o=size=512M,mode=0700`\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/233673937/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/233683180","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/918#issuecomment-233683180","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/918","id":233683180,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMzY4MzE4MA==","user":{"login":"mdeuser","id":18535381,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTM1Mzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18535381?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser","html_url":"https://github.com/mdeuser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-19T16:09:02Z","updated_at":"2016-07-19T16:09:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This fix now results in `invalid activation id` being returned from the server.\n\nI noticed other error message strings in the commit that include additional information that indicates more specifically about what is wrong with the id  - i.e.  `activation id is malformed (too long)`,  `activation id is malformed (too short)`.

@cpuguy83 thanks for chiming in. regarding the user namespace problem, yes that is going to be an issue. We want to prevent fork bombs in the container, the current idea is ulimit nproc which works on a per-user basis and only on non-root users. Since we have stability issues with docker >=1.10 we are currently stuck on 1.9.1. I have proposed running our containers as non-root (see issue #898) using the `docker run -u` option with a high UID. Of course this would mean we would have to maintain the UIDs ourselves. \nIt would be awesome to have nproc-like limits on containers.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/233735976/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/233738956","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/890#issuecomment-233738956","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/890","id":233738956,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMzczODk1Ng==","user":{"login":"cpuguy83","id":799078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5OTA3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/799078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpuguy83","html_url":"https://github.com/cpuguy83","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpuguy83/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpuguy83/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpuguy83/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpuguy83/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpuguy83/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpuguy83/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpuguy83/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpuguy83/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpuguy83/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-19T19:24:57Z","updated_at":"2016-07-19T19:24:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@domdom82 What stability issues?

Here is the gist by @perryibm :\n\n> History: After upgrading from docker 1.9 to 1.10 and then 1.11, we experienced increasing and  then severe instability to the point where the docker daemon, under light-moderate load, will go into a bad state in 3-6 hours. We decided to downgrade to 1.9 and have since achieved stability. But we still want to go forward and have been consulting local Docker experts.\n> \n> aufs has frequent \"Failed to remove...\" issues which are readily reproducible with even a modest level of concurrency. Withe 2 threads doing run and rm it often takes 10 iterations before it manifests. In my experience, overlayfs completely solves this particular problem (even if there are other issues).\n> \n> All of docker 1.9 to 1.11 experience daemon inconsistencies and soft panic when under concurrent load as recently as of May-Jun 2016. See https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/19758. It is dependent on concurrency (to enable the bug) and heavy load (to make it show up faster) and use of docker features particularly networking (to lengthen the critical section and increase race probability).\n> \n> In local testing (my python script), I have measured that the speedup of concurrent operations is modest for 1.9 (only 20%) and significant for 1.11 (60-70%).\n> \n> Docker 1.11 has a bug with pause/unpause which was diagnosed by Doug David. He sent me a patched docker which fixes the issue. Independently and around the same time, a similar fix was merged into the code base so presumably it will show up in 1.12.\n> \n> Conclusions:\n> 1. Use overlayfs\n> 2. Docker 1.9 seems stable if we eschew parallelism. In any case, based on (3) alone, it's a disappointing gain.\n> 3. Docker 1.10 is not obviously more stable than 1.11 so don't bother with it either.\n> 4. Docker 1.11 is not useable unless we deploy a patched version and even so it fails under concurrent load. It does offer a glimmer of hope in terms of better performance.\n> 5. Docker 1.12 - who knows? It does not seem to me that our container use case is well-supported by Docker.\n\n---\n\nBottom line: \n- We had problems with parallel docker operations in general. (both 1.9.x and later)\n- We worked around it by serializing docker operations per invoker node.\n- Switched from aufs to overlay (which currently pokes us with inode exhaustion but it is manageable)\n- docker 1.11 seems most promising performance-wise but it has problems with pause/unpause\n- We would probably go with docker 1.11 if the mentioned pause/unpause-patch were merged (maybe it is now, @perryibm can you elaborate on this?)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/233887226/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/233891041","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/890#issuecomment-233891041","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/890","id":233891041,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMzg5MTA0MQ==","user":{"login":"estesp","id":1397980,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTc5ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1397980?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/estesp","html_url":"https://github.com/estesp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/estesp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/estesp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/estesp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/estesp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/estesp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/estesp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/estesp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/estesp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/estesp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-20T08:52:42Z","updated_at":"2016-07-20T08:52:42Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@cpuguy83 I've also been involved as well as @duglin in trying to help with some of the performance/stability issues.\n\nA couple comments:\n- The pause/unpause fix is merged into docker/docker master, but did not make any of the 1.11.x point releases, so officially 1.12 will be the first release to include it. 1.12 is at rc4, so it would be good for it to be tested ASAP to see if that + other changes fixes any of these issues.\n- The \"overlay2\" driver has been merged and I believe is in 1.12; this will significantly resolve inode exhaustion issues from what I understand. I believe it has a kernel dependency, but not onerous if I remember correctly.\n- I've looked on/off at some of the parallelism issues, but need a more deterministic scenario to replicate some of the issues seen at full load so that it can be debugged more fully to start to determine where fixes are necessary.
