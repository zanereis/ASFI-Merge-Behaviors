These changes are motivated by recent work that the The ASF Data Privacy team is doing to establish ASF-wide policies in this area. As part of this work, they recently published a draft policy for ASF websites: https://privacy.apache.org/policies/website-policy.html.\r\n\r\nI has been *years* since I've contributed to Mesos, and I helped develop the original middleman-based Mesos website. Fast-forward to today: I want to make sure we're ahead of the curve when it comes to updating the site to be compliant with policy. These patches should be a solid first-pass at meeting the standards of the policy (removal of Google Analytics, social media embeds, etc).\r\n\r\nRegarding testing: I pursued a different way to test these changes -- by running `middleman serve` locally to generate the static site. The site base template looks good after making changes in the footer and CSS/JS continue to load properly after changing the site to load them from ASF servers.\r\n\r\nIt's been a while since anyone -- including myself -- has deployed a new version of the Mesos site so my hope is that the build process still functions properly. If not, happy to work with others to help fix it.\r\n\r\nI also see the several out-of-date Ruby libraries that we depend on. I began a separate patch to upgrade them, but for purposes of this initial contribution I wanted to focus on modifying templates and static content.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mesos/issues/comments/1114023927/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mesos/issues/comments/1114039200","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mesos/pull/431#issuecomment-1114039200","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mesos/issues/431","id":1114039200,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAK8Cf85CZuOg","user":{"login":"cf-natali","id":8378227,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNzgyMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8378227?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cf-natali","html_url":"https://github.com/cf-natali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cf-natali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cf-natali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cf-natali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cf-natali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cf-natali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cf-natali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cf-natali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cf-natali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cf-natali/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-30T19:12:37Z","updated_at":"2022-04-30T19:12:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Alright,

@jblache, cool to see this getting upstreamed. A couple of suggestions:\r\n\r\n* Can you a more detailed overview of the implementation approach in the PR description? It's a bit hard to dive into reviewing this code from the current description.\r\n* To ease reviewing, typically we break apart patches. For example, in this PR, the nvml.hpp/cpp files can easily be their own commit for review purposes. I haven't used github PRs for reviewing stacks of commits, but I think if you just split the commits and use multiple in the PR, it should be at least reviewable in chunks, but probably not as directly committable in chunks. If you want to use reviewboard I think there is still support with ./support/post-reviews.py\r\n\r\nIf others chime in here willing to review, perhaps we can organize a meeting to review more easily. I'm not active in mesos lately but would be willing to provide some feedback here.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mesos/issues/comments/1409388019/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mesos/issues/comments/1410699238","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mesos/pull/454#issuecomment-1410699238","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mesos/issues/454","id":1410699238,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAK8Cf85UFY_m","user":{"login":"jblache","id":30199212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMTk5MjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30199212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jblache","html_url":"https://github.com/jblache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jblache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jblache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jblache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jblache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jblache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jblache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jblache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jblache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jblache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-31T16:31:51Z","updated_at":"2023-01-31T16:31:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Pushed a more granular version of the branch, which at least splits the discovery vs. isolation bits. Original postback was squashed for internal review reasons mostly.\r\n\r\nOn the approach, the NVML wrapper was updated to add support for the calls needed to discover/query MIG GPUs, and a couple of those added interfaces have a bit of logic included that keeps the calling code cleaner and overall makes sense.\r\n\r\nGPU enumeration will check for MIG and enumerate MIG devices if present, instead of the underlying GPU.\r\n\r\nThe isolator now has to include all the nvidia-caps device nodes, which is a lot of them, but anything more granular seems pretty involved and brittle (IIRC one of the reasons I didn't look into it more is that it would likely get in the the way of a dynamic configuration).\r\n\r\nThe tricky bit is reconciling device allocations upon restart with running jobs. It turned out to be not too bad, but the code grew accordingly there. I forget the details, but there's a bit more data that needs to be kept around to be able to match everything up, and the matching logic needs to look for MIG vs. not MIG, basically.\r\n\r\nThis was a tactical patch for us and, as you can see, it sat on my TODO list for bit before I could get it out to you. I don't have bandwidth currently to engage in a full-blown review process, but wanted to get the code out for anyone who might have similar needs, and as groundwork for more evolved capabilities around MIG.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mesos/issues/comments/1410699238/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mesos/issues/comments/1433082532","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mesos/pull/454#issuecomment-1433082532","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mesos/issues/454","id":1433082532,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAK8Cf85Vaxqk","user":{"login":"andreaspeters","id":19497059,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDk3MDU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19497059?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreaspeters","html_url":"https://github.com/andreaspeters","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreaspeters/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreaspeters/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreaspeters/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreaspeters/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreaspeters/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreaspeters/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreaspeters/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreaspeters/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreaspeters/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-16T13:23:04Z","updated_at":"2023-02-16T13:23:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"For me it looks fine.

second histogram have not run for as long as in the first histogram, but I can run another analysis and see how it looks currently (years later :)).\r\n\r\n> Out of interest, have you considered limiting the number of libprocess threads instead, since you mention that most of the are dormant (I can see the memory savings wouldn't be as significant)? Typically, how many cores do the agents hosts have?\r\n\r\nyes that's a good suggestion and we probably should be doing this in addition to limiting jemalloc's thread count, note that libprocess currently enforces 8 cores to overcome deadlocking in mesos tests: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-818\r\n\r\nLooking at a random agent in production with 133 threads, it has about 123MB of RSS and 1.5GB of VSS, all these threads are definitely bloating the VSS but not sure how much they are increasing the RSS. I can report back how much reducing the thread count helps cut this down, but probably won't be able to look into this soon.\r\n\r\nProbably the mesos agent should be defaulting the number of libprocess worker threads to some reasonable maximum to avoid creating too many on large servers, but internally we could limit this via the environment variable instead.\r\n\r\nWe have some servers with 128 reported cores (64 cores / 128 hyperthreads), and there are upcoming servers that will have 256 reported cores, so jemalloc is quite wasteful on these servers.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mesos/issues/comments/1907166415/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mesos/issues/comments/1908789990","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mesos/pull/489#issuecomment-1908789990","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mesos/issues/489","id":1908789990,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAK8Cf85xxdLm","user":{"login":"DevinLeamy","id":45083086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MDgzMDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45083086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DevinLeamy","html_url":"https://github.com/DevinLeamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DevinLeamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DevinLeamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DevinLeamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DevinLeamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DevinLeamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DevinLeamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DevinLeamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DevinLeamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DevinLeamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-24T19:34:22Z","updated_at":"2024-01-24T19:34:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closed
