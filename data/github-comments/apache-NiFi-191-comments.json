It looks like `nifi-schema-inference-utils` does not depend on `nifi-record-serialization-services-api` right now, which is the reason for their current location. It actually seems like a `nifi-record-serialization-services-shared` module under `nifi-record-serialization-services-bundle` would be a reasonable approach. That would keep the classes closer to their current usage, but also support reuse in `nifi-poi-services` as planned.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1584952966/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1587668039","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/7368#issuecomment-1587668039","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/7368","id":1587668039,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5eoeRH","user":{"login":"r-sidd","id":133347946,"node_id":"U_kgDOB_K6ag","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133347946?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/r-sidd","html_url":"https://github.com/r-sidd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r-sidd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r-sidd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r-sidd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r-sidd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r-sidd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r-sidd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r-sidd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r-sidd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r-sidd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-12T16:28:04Z","updated_at":"2023-06-12T16:28:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Thanks for the contribution @r-sidd, however, this change cannot go forward at this time.

In our case, it's a bit complicated, we use NiFi in AWS EKS.

In the NiFi, I use the `AWSCredentialsProviderControllerService` processor and by setting `Use Default Credentials` to `true`, then I can read the temporary permissions provided by the STS to access AWS related services.

The current Processors are very inefficient in terms of memory usage and JSON parsing, so they should be deprecated for removal.

I think we are good with all changes as suggested. \r\nBut I had a question though on QueryAzureDataExplorer. Since it mandatorily requires a flow file to query into ADX, can this processor become a starting point of a flow where we query into ADX using input query and write the output to a file or some other output processor?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1600079607/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1600584944","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/7416#issuecomment-1600584944","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/7416","id":1600584944,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5fZvzw","user":{"login":"MikeThomsen","id":108184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODE4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeThomsen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-21T10:26:12Z","updated_at":"2023-06-21T10:26:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Put the wrong issue # in the commit line, closing manually.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1600584944/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1600646995","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/7045#issuecomment-1600646995","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/7045","id":1600646995,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5fZ-9T","user":{"login":"nandorsoma","id":11146937,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTQ2OTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11146937?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nandorsoma","html_url":"https://github.com/nandorsoma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nandorsoma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nandorsoma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nandorsoma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nandorsoma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nandorsoma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nandorsoma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nandorsoma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nandorsoma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nandorsoma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-21T11:14:38Z","updated_at":"2023-06-21T11:14:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@zhangzhonglai, a little addition to what @ChrisSamo632 said. In NiFi, we prefer solutions when we can do explicit configuration. It is easier to test, features are more apparent, less documentation is needed, and most of the time it involves less surprise. However, there are more and more libraries that do some kind of \"automagic\", but we need to integrate them into NiFi. The main issue is that they are not designed in mind that they need to be part of a framework. Though our goal is to make them feel native to NiFi. If it can be done via workaround, so be it. That was my general take on the topic.\r\n\r\nRegarding #5775. We can reference environment variables in properties with expression language, so the PR might work for you without the extra library. For that, we need to set the `ExpressionLanguageScope` of the property to anything other than `NONE`. Preferably to `FLOWFILE_ATTRIBUTES`. Could you test that the PR mentioned solves your issue?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1600646995/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
