That much we all agree on. I'm simply proposing that we start the process to make the work easier later on.\r\n\r\nThe first step in that process, to me, would be to mark the `finalize()` methods as deprecated like I propose. Doing this makes the process a little bit \"easier\" because the spots that need work will be more easily discoverable.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1418243877/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1418246119","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/5435#issuecomment-1418246119","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5435","id":1418246119,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5UiLfn","user":{"login":"neilcsmith-net","id":3975960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3975960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net","html_url":"https://github.com/neilcsmith-net","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-05T19:33:41Z","updated_at":"2023-02-05T19:33:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> We are going to need to change the base release if and when we resolve the finalization issue.\r\n\r\nYou can replace `finalize()` using JDK 8 if need be.

Both GitHub UI and CLI have (different) negative side effects there. Do agree that multiple commits can be better when kept during reviews though. PR branches are generally writable by committers as well as authors, so squashing and force pushing into the PR branch (where warranted) for final checks before merging is ideal IMO.\r\n\r\n@neilcsmith-net I had always thought that references to `CLI` were about the `git` command. But I couldn't deny my ignorance anymore after reading what you said, yet another thing about git/github I didn't want to know.\r\n\r\nSo if I get this right, a pattern is to push several commits to a PR, then after approval, can squash locally (using mercurial in my case) and force push to the PR.\r\n\r\nDoes the compare button associated with a forced push after a local-squash/force-push show no changes (assuming, of course, that there were no changes)?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1418467020/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1418496277","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/5433#issuecomment-1418496277","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5433","id":1418496277,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5UjIkV","user":{"login":"junichi11","id":738383,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczODM4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/738383?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11","html_url":"https://github.com/junichi11","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-06T04:23:59Z","updated_at":"2023-02-06T04:23:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Is the plugin in a state that it could be delivered by plugin centre?\r\n\r\nNo. I'll add it to the PP when I have time.

If then GH actions is happy, I'll merge.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1423273640/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1423797891","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/5455#issuecomment-1423797891","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5455","id":1423797891,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5U3W6D","user":{"login":"jlahoda","id":124144,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDE0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/124144?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda","html_url":"https://github.com/jlahoda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-09T08:16:52Z","updated_at":"2023-02-09T08:16:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sorry i misclicked and marked it as ready by accident.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1423797891/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":1,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1423830782","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/5455#issuecomment-1423830782","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5455","id":1423830782,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5U3e7-","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-09T08:47:47Z","updated_at":"2023-02-09T08:49:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"haha. looks like most tests except those few I ran locally are red.
