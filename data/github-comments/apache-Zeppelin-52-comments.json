In our case if we run the \"RemoteInterpreterServer\" as the proxy user, the rest of the flow is kind of taken care automatically. I have tested with/without Kerberos (by adding  SPARK_SUBMIT_OPTIONS=\"--proxy-user vijay -v\" in bin/zeppelin-env.sh) and it works fine.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/214963331/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/214972953","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/849#issuecomment-214972953","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/849","id":214972953,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNDk3Mjk1Mw==","user":{"login":"Leemoonsoo","id":1540981,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDA5ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1540981?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo","html_url":"https://github.com/Leemoonsoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-27T05:25:33Z","updated_at":"2016-04-27T05:25:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks @rohannr for the improvement and test.

'SPARK-10872' is expected while default configuration of sparkcontext creates 'metastore_db' in the same location.

Alternatively, you can set 'zeppelin.spark.useHiveContext' to 'false' in Interpreter menu, if you're not relying on HiveQL.\n\nRegarding proxy user support, If passing \"--proxy-user\" argument in SPARK_SUBMIT_OPTIONS is the only way, Zeppelin needs extra mechanism to pass this argument.
