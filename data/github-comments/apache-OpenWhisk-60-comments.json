IIUC the current proposal then developers would choose at _design_ time if an action is a \"web-export\" or not. From an _internal OW_ perspective that means choosing if the features described [here](https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk/pull/1783/files#diff-444445a530f5b36d76f58f15f9220f49R39) are enabled. But look at it from a _developer_'s perspective: it means choosing which HTTP clients to support - either browsers or non-browsers (IoT devices, curl, etc).\r\nOne could argue that developers know the intended usage and can make that decision at design time. But at least in the scenario in above mentioned comment things become tricky: would action \"D\" the one catching errors be \"web-export\"'ed or not? Would it depend on the annotations of the whole composite?\r\nRather than trying to come up with a proposal/solution for the complexity above, I have a more generic proposal (or at least question): can we make *all* actions \"web-export\"? What would happen if we did that?\r\nThe big advantage I see with this approach is that developers could consistently use the features you have [described](https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk/pull/1783/files#diff-444445a530f5b36d76f58f15f9220f49R39) in _any_ action they write - i.e. they would not have to make design time choices about the user agents that use the action.\r\nPotential downside I see: adding semantic meaning to fields that are potentially used already might break legacy code (but I guess that could be managed through deprecation etc). Mabe there are other disadvantages I am not aware of.\r\nWDYT?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/277547204/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/277549898","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/1783#issuecomment-277549898","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1783","id":277549898,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NzU0OTg5OA==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-05T21:13:29Z","updated_at":"2017-02-05T21:32:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The reason I put all these features under a separate API route is precisely not to worry about legacy, or how to resolve tension with the main line API at first. The web action features are orthogonal to the try-catch solutions and should be considered separately.\r\n\r\nI would plan to promote the web actions related changes to the main line action activation in stages. For example, while we can introduce path projection for action invocation with a small change to the path matcher, supporting extensions will be a breaking change (if we require it on all activations, it's not backward compatible, and if we treat it as an extension when present, then it's also a breaking change since it might have been part of the action name). Allowing form data and query parameters is doable on the v1 API.\r\n\r\nOne approach I considered is to disallow extensions on the main API path but offer all the other features. Extensions would remain in effect only for web-exported actions.\r\n\r\nWhat you're pointing out is that web-export currently implies a few semantic changes or new features that are conflated. They are:\r\n\r\n1. anonymous vs authenticated activation\r\n2. content type extensions\r\n3. result path projection\r\n4. query and form data\r\n5. http caller context\r\n6. error handling\r\n\r\nI don't disagree with your insights that we should promote these features to the main API for action activation. It's just a matter of doing so in a deliberate order and considering impact on existing code. A v2 of the API could give us greater latitude and there are other reasons to forge ahead with a second rev of the API. That arguably is going over board, since as I noted above, several of the new features can be retrofit to v1.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/277549898/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/277552814","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/1783#issuecomment-277552814","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1783","id":277552814,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NzU1MjgxNA==","user":{"login":"michaelmarth","id":45336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelmarth","html_url":"https://github.com/michaelmarth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelmarth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelmarth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelmarth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelmarth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelmarth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelmarth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelmarth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelmarth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelmarth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-05T21:54:01Z","updated_at":"2017-02-05T21:54:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi Rodric, thank you!

Pretty simple. He can deploy that action with the web-export.\r\nBut the way it is currently specified, _only_ actions can be web-export-annotated.

Thank you to let me know.\r\nLet me clarify my query.\r\n\r\nIn both local/distributed environment, user can CRUD/invoke of actions.\r\nIn local environment, endpoint IP is 172.17.0.1 and distributed environment, it is host IP.\r\nSo if there is no case user should directly access to containers with container IP such as 172.17.0.X, it might work.\r\n\r\nI am just wondering in which cases user/components are communicating with containers with container IPs directly.\r\nAs @csantanapr mentioned above, if this is really how it works in reality, it would be better for me to know the cases in order to find the workaround.\r\n\r\nAs per my understanding, user/components communicate each other according to the IPs in `whisk.properties` file.\r\nSo I just thought that if test cases also can communicate with the IP in `whisk.properties` file rather than container IP which is retrieved by `docker inspect`, it might

As in if the (initial) invoke parameters contained the property, whatever it is called, should the sequence really not run?\r\n\r\nI think this behavior is wrong or at the very least surprising - since it applies only to sequences. We should consider the two points separately (behavior if invoke time parameters specify the property for error, and name of the error property). Changing the name of the property to something less common is just hiding the behavior/making it less likely to happen in practice.
