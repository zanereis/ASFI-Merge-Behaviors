some feedback on this topic.\n\nFrom @kristofa \n\n```\nAbout duration for an annotation. This can be used to track duration of certain parts of your app. For example I had the idea of submitting an annotation with duration for measuring Json serialisation time. The annotation is displayed in Zipkin-web on the Span at its time stamp. Unfortunately the actual duration is not displayed in Zipkin-web. That's why in Brave I added the duration, if specified, to the annotation name.\n```\n\nFrom @yurishkuro \n\n```\nI had a meeting today with our mobile team, they are interested in using Zipkin tracing for measuring timing of various functions within the app, ranging across time to open a controller, time to resolve DNS, time to call a service, etc. Not all of these use cases fit directly into Zipkin RPC model, some are more like stages of an operation rather than sub-spans. An annotation's duration might be an interesting one to use.\n```\n\nI'd suggest that if folks want to use duration, then let's evaluate it against real use cases. You may find overlaps with sub-service spans, normal metrics, or even find that duration would work better on BinaryAnnotation (which has both key and value). Duration certainly does seem handy, but we do need to face the facts that this is a broken and confusing part of zipkin.\n\nLeaving something handy, but broke in zipkin is worse than removing it, IMHO. Decent use cases, tests and documentation would be the only way we could prevent repeating status quo, which is broken and has led to curious implementations and bugs in an unusable feature.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/141433335/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/141445386","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/717#issuecomment-141445386","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/717","id":141445386,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MTQ0NTM4Ng==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-18T13:01:22Z","updated_at":"2015-09-18T13:06:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thinking about alternatives here, too. One thing we've tossed around is having a [common data model for annotations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pxZ5NQHftJzhlCIT4vMfOT6QT_StikaoDc_NCdfesoA/edit). Let's take the case of GC, for example.\n\nGC happens to be something that isn't caused by the span, it is metadata present, which could help explain timing, but it could be far longer than the span itself and hint at a visualization concern. Nevertheless, let's consider how we might do this.\n\nAs opposed to an `Annotation`, which has a timestamp, and a name, but no value like this:\n\n```\nvalue=Gc(10,0.PSScavenge,2015-09-17 12:57:12 +0000,525.milliseconds+970.microseconds)\nduration=525970\n```\n\nWhat if this were a `BinaryAnnotation` which doesn't have a timestamp, but does have a value:\n\n```\nkey=gc.durationMillis\ntype=I32\nvalue=525970\n```\n\nSpeaking with @dsyer here, this seems to make more sense, as you can query against it, and its namespace explains itself. Moreover, it is ancillary information to explain the span (ex. it isn't a sub-span, or an activity directly caused by it)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/141445386/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/141524376","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/717#issuecomment-141524376","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/717","id":141524376,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MTUyNDM3Ng==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-18T18:17:56Z","updated_at":"2015-09-18T18:17:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Merging as I think @kristofa and @yurishkuro are on board:\n\n@kristofa \n\n```\nYes.
