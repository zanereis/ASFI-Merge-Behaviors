You should not set any checkpoint value if I am not wrong. can you help me understand. \"earliest/latest\" is meant for auto reset for kafka sources.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, you are absolutely correct. The reason why I set the value of checkpoint is that sqlsource in version 0.9.0 cannot extract data if checkpoint is not set，There will be the following logs：\r\n```java\r\nNo new data, source checkpoint has not changed. Nothing to commit. Old checkpoint=(Optional.empty). New Checkpoint=(null) \r\n```\r\nSo I try to set checkpoint and set a meaningless value, and then I can extract the data, but there will be this exception when I extract again.\r\n\r\nIn the new version, the problem that data cannot be extracted has been solved by adding the parameter ` --allow-commit-on-no-checkpoint-change'，However, if the user mistakenly sets a checkpoint that should not be set, there will still be this exception, so I think we should solve this problem and avoid this exception\r\n\r\nAs for 'earliest/latest', we can change it to a value at will, such as  '0'","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1165064752/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1165108198","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/5948#issuecomment-1165108198","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/5948","id":1165108198,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5FciPm","user":{"login":"xiarixiaoyao","id":13514703,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTE0NzAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13514703?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiarixiaoyao","html_url":"https://github.com/xiarixiaoyao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiarixiaoyao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiarixiaoyao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiarixiaoyao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiarixiaoyao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiarixiaoyao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiarixiaoyao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiarixiaoyao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiarixiaoyao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiarixiaoyao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-24T02:10:14Z","updated_at":"2022-06-25T01:17:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@leesf
