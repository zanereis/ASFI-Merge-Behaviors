It does make sense especially when it comes to ingestion with perfect rollup. Distributed indexing would involve shuffle for perfect rollup while multi-thread indexing can be done in a single or a few machines. I would expect we can benefit from using both of them, like distributed multi-thread indexing. \r\n\r\n@sanastas that sounds good. Looks like `OnheapIncrementalIndexBenchmark` is the benchmark for multiple reads and writes, haven't looked at it carefully though.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/505644019/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/505657558","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/7900#issuecomment-505657558","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7900","id":505657558,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNTY1NzU1OA==","user":{"login":"dclim","id":11050882,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDUwODgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11050882?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim","html_url":"https://github.com/dclim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-25T23:20:07Z","updated_at":"2019-06-25T23:20:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jon-wei thanks for writing this up, some questions:\r\n\r\n- Do we get query prioritization support? Since the query-serving resources are a shared pool among all the tasks, we'd want to make sure that important queries can take precedence over heavier ones.\r\n- What does the query endpoint look like? Will it be shared among all tasks similar to the chat handler (rather than using a different port for each task)? Something like `POST http://{bigIndexerHost}:{bigIndexerPort}/druid/v2/{taskId}`\r\n\r\n- Regarding `globalIngestionHeapLimitBytes`:\r\n\r\n> When the sum of ingestion memory usage and merging memory usage across all tasks reaches globalIngestionHeapLimitBytes, the BigIndexer will trigger a global persist, causing each managed task to persist its in-heap segment data.\r\n\r\n> The BigIndexer will also have a mode where the global limit is divided evenly across the number of worker slots.\r\n\r\nI think having a global heap limit configuration instead of just using the per-task `maxBytesInMemory` is great and would allow us to optimize our usage of the available memory. I don't really understand why we need to have a mode that divides the heap into fixed portions; what is the benefit of this? To me this feels like a throwback to the current model where every worker is allocated the same memory, whether it needs it or not, and large tasks suffer when run together with a bunch of small tasks. The main advantage I can see for this is that the global spill will not trigger in this case, which prevents unnecessary spills when you have a bunch of small tasks running with some big tasks that would otherwise keep triggering the global spill. As another option to consider, what do you think about having a configuration parameter that controls the minimum bytes in memory that needs to be reached before a sink is eligible to be spilled during a global spill? The default value could be something like `globalIngestionHeapLimitBytes / druid.worker.capacity` + some accounting for merging memory requirements. This would give the flexibility of heavy tasks being able to utilize more than its 'equal share' of memory, while preventing unnecessary fragmentation for lightweight tasks.\r\n\r\n- How do shared lookups work? Are all lookups loaded into memory when the BigIndexer starts, regardless of whether it is running tasks and if those tasks are query-serving? Will a BigIndexer release lookups that haven't been used in a while?\r\n- Can the connection/thread pool for chat handlers be separate from the one used for serving queries? For supervised tasks, the supervisor tends to flip out if the task stops responding to control/status requests, and if the pool is shared, I could see some annoying issues where heavy query load to one set of tasks causes the supervisor to kill completely unrelated tasks for being unresponsive.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/505657558/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/505658284","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/7900#issuecomment-505658284","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7900","id":505658284,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNTY1ODI4NA==","user":{"login":"fjy","id":428325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODMyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy","html_url":"https://github.com/fjy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-25T23:23:38Z","updated_at":"2019-06-25T23:23:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think we should just call it an indexer process.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/505658284/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/505667101","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/7955#issuecomment-505667101","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7955","id":505667101,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNTY2NzEwMQ==","user":{"login":"Kiddinglife","id":10578713,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTc4NzEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10578713?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kiddinglife","html_url":"https://github.com/Kiddinglife","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kiddinglife/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kiddinglife/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kiddinglife/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kiddinglife/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kiddinglife/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kiddinglife/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kiddinglife/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kiddinglife/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kiddinglife/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-26T00:09:45Z","updated_at":"2019-06-26T01:09:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@gianm I see.

\r\n\r\n> Do we get query prioritization support? Since the query-serving resources are a shared pool among all the tasks, we'd want to make sure that important queries can take precedence over heavier ones.\r\n\r\nYes, this should be supported.\r\n\r\n> What does the query endpoint look like? Will it be shared among all tasks similar to the chat handler (rather than using a different port for each task)? Something like POST http://{bigIndexerHost}:{bigIndexerPort}/druid/v2/{taskId}\r\n\r\nI'm thinking it should be shared across all tasks, but the endpoint would just be `http://{bigIndexerHost}:{bigIndexerPort}/druid/v2` without a taskId\r\n\r\n> How do shared lookups work? Are all lookups loaded into memory when the BigIndexer starts, regardless of whether it is running tasks and if those tasks are query-serving? Will a BigIndexer release lookups that haven't been used in a while?\r\n\r\nFor simplicity in the initial implementation, I'm thinking all lookups should be loaded into memory when the indexer starts. (Re: query-serving, I believe lookups can also be used during ingestion, via transform specs->lookup expressions)\r\n\r\n> Can the connection/thread pool for chat handlers be separate from the one used for serving queries? For supervised tasks, the supervisor tends to flip out if the task stops responding to control/status requests, and if the pool is shared, I could see some annoying issues where heavy query load to one set of tasks causes the supervisor to kill completely unrelated tasks for being unresponsive.\r\n\r\nThat sounds like a good idea, I'll look into that.\r\n\r\n> To me this feels like a throwback to the current model where every worker is allocated the same memory, whether it needs it or not, and large tasks suffer when run together with a bunch of small tasks. The main advantage I can see for this is that the global spill will not trigger in this case, which prevents unnecessary spills when you have a bunch of small tasks running with some big tasks that would otherwise keep triggering the global spill.\r\n\r\nHm, it was intended as a throwback mode, I'll reconsider whether that's useful to include. \r\n\r\n> As another option to consider, what do you think about having a configuration parameter that controls the minimum bytes in memory that needs to be reached before a sink is eligible to be spilled during a global spill? The default value could be something like globalIngestionHeapLimitBytes / druid.worker.capacity + some accounting for merging memory requirements. This would give the flexibility of heavy tasks being able to utilize more than its 'equal share' of memory, while preventing unnecessary fragmentation for lightweight tasks.\r\n\r\nThis sounds useful, I will look into this as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n@fjy \r\n\r\n> I think we should just call it an indexer process.\r\n\r\nThat sounds good.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/505676072/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/505688551","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/7960#issuecomment-505688551","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7960","id":505688551,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNTY4ODU1MQ==","user":{"login":"ThreeEarthGod","id":43139217,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTM5MjE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43139217?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThreeEarthGod","html_url":"https://github.com/ThreeEarthGod","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThreeEarthGod/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThreeEarthGod/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThreeEarthGod/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThreeEarthGod/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThreeEarthGod/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThreeEarthGod/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThreeEarthGod/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThreeEarthGod/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThreeEarthGod/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-26T02:10:07Z","updated_at":"2019-06-26T02:10:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks

Two other things that I was thinking about that might be interesting, or might be out of scope for this proposal:\r\n\r\n- A GC watchdog that tries to save an indexer that's going to die unnecessarily - this has been alleviated somewhat by using `maxBytesInMemory` instead of `maxRowsInMemory`, but I think can still be an issue because query heap usage is not strictly bounded and unexpected query load could cause OOM issues (and this effect would be compounded if you have multiple tasks running in the same JVM), but basically: indexing tasks often die because of heap exhaustion unnecessarily - meaning that the data in the heap didn't _need_ to be there, and if a spill would have been triggered, the indexing task could continue on. I'm thinking of some kind of watchdog thread that uses `GarbageCollectorMXBean` similar to `JvmMonitor` and if a threshold of number of GCs or GC time in a given period is hit, the watchdog will force a global spill to try to save the indexer.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Some intelligence around task assignment that's better than random - an easy win here would be to weight known resource-light tasks (Hadoop indexing task, parallel master task?) lesser than other tasks. We might also want to consider query-serving realtime tasks separately from batch jobs and optimize for those (distributing them evenly across the indexers so that they're not all running on the same machine and sharing processing threads/buffers while the buffers are unused on other machines because they're running all batch jobs) - I think being able to respond to realtime queries quickly is typically more important than ingestion throughput. Later on, it would be pretty interesting to look at historical task report information to try to understand what are the heavy datasources (in terms of both query and ingestion volume) and what are the light ones and further optimize using this information.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, I'm +1 on this proposal. Assuming that the new indexer will have enable/disable routes that toggle whether it will receive new task assignments similar to the MM for supporting rolling updates.

One benchmark is for directly comparing performance of `OakIncrementalIndex` and `OnheapIncrementalIndex` (and optionally `OffheapIncrementalIndex` to show how optimized `OakIncrementalIndex` is to store data in off-heap memory). The benchmark result would include both ingestion throughput and latency to see how GC could affect to the ingestion performance.\r\n\r\nAnother benchmark which is I think nice to have would measure the performance of `Appenderator`. `Appenderator` is a wrapper class of `IncrementalIndex` to hide the details of persisting intermediary segments into local disk, and is used by both native batch index task and Kafka/Kinesis index tasks. I think it would be a good benchmark to show how `OakIncrementalIndex` could make the ingestion performance better by testing production code path.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/506097278/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/506144259","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/7931#issuecomment-506144259","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7931","id":506144259,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNjE0NDI1OQ==","user":{"login":"shizhengchao","id":22866465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODY2NDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22866465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shizhengchao","html_url":"https://github.com/shizhengchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shizhengchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shizhengchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shizhengchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shizhengchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shizhengchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shizhengchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shizhengchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shizhengchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shizhengchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-27T03:41:33Z","updated_at":"2019-06-27T03:41:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@gianm \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/506144259/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/506144823","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/7970#issuecomment-506144823","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7970","id":506144823,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNjE0NDgyMw==","user":{"login":"vogievetsky","id":177816,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzgxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177816?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky","html_url":"https://github.com/vogievetsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-27T03:44:56Z","updated_at":"2019-06-27T03:44:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This is related to https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/issues/7952 right?
