 \r\n\r\n我们考虑另外一种方案： hash分配cmd，去掉scheduler\r\n \r\n1. master启动时，根据zk和配置文件（槽位配置）计算出自己的槽位数，可能是多个 \r\n2. master根据自己的masterIds从db取cmd,根据cmdId除模取余,只取和槽位匹配的cmd \r\n3. master上下线处理（master1=m1,master2=m2）\r\n    1. m1上线，先计算出自己的masterIds，再开始取任务执行 \r\n    2. m2上线，m1收到m2上线的消息以后，获取到一个全局锁，停止取cmd，重新计算自己的masterIds，同步给所有的master消息 \r\n    3. 其他master收到消息以后，停止取cmd，重新计算自身masterIds，并将结果同步回复给m1 \r\n    4. m1确定所有master都回复以后，再同步给所有的master一条消息，开始取新的cmd，释放全局锁 \r\n    5. m1如果收到回复超时或者失败了，需要重新执行同步所有master的操作。 \r\n    6. m3/m4如果收到已经处理过的消息，就跳过处理流程。 \r\n\r\n

which can well remove the zk lock and reduce the number of database polls, but at the same time the HA mode is also a single point of work mode. When the number of cmd is large, the distribution of cmd will It is the bottleneck point, so we consider implementing a truly decentralized distributed design to realize the processing of cmd.\r\n\r\nWe consider another option:\r\n Hash allocation cmd, remove scheduler\r\n \r\n1. When the master starts, it calculates its own slot number according to zk and configuration file (slot configuration), which may be more than one\r\n2. The master takes cmd from db according to its own masterIds, and takes the remainder according to cmdId, and only takes cmd that matches the slot.\r\n3. Master online and offline processing (master1=m1, master2=m2)\r\n    1. m1 is online, first calculate its own masterIds, and then start to take the task to execute\r\n    2. After m2 goes online, m1 obtains a global lock after receiving the message that m2 goes online, stops fetching cmd, recalculates its own masterIds, and synchronizes messages to all masters\r\n    3. After receiving the message, other masters stop fetching cmd, recalculate their own masterIds, and reply the result to m1 synchronously\r\n    4. After m1 confirms that all masters have responded, it will synchronize a message to all masters, start to fetch a new cmd, and release the global lock\r\n    5. If m1 receives a response timeout or fails, it needs to re-execute the operation of synchronizing all masters.\r\n    6.
