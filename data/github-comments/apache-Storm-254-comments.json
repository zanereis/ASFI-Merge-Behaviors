I implemented the original patch, and would like to review these changes.Thanks.\n\nI am still a bit confused about the duplicated acking tuples. If that is the case, that could be a possible storm guarantees problem, which should be fixed at its root cause, and not worked around in spout code. Furthermore, from what I understand, as far as the findNextOffset method behavior, the duplicate acking should be irrelevant, because once all the tuples up to a certain offset have been acked, they will be committed in the next commit call. For example let's say `1,2,3,4,5, 8,9,10` have acked, on the next commit call, `1,2,3,4,5` should be committed, but `8,9,10` won't be until `6,7` get acked. If `6,7` never get acked, say (retry forever scenario), then the desired behavior is that `8,9,10` never get committed. @jfenc91 Can you help me understand how does the duplicate acking interfere in this scenario, and how?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/248858172/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/248863780","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1704#issuecomment-248863780","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1704","id":248863780,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0ODg2Mzc4MA==","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-22T10:22:39Z","updated_at":"2016-09-22T10:22:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Tests of storm-sql-core failed because of VM crashing.

With the previous code, that would permanently break findNextCommitOffset. \n\nfindNextCommitOffset would start at 5, and the first message in ackedMsgs list is 4. The code breaks out of the loop over ackedMsgs, since the else block in L496 is hit, causing the function to return null. When null is returned to commitOffsetsForAckedTuples, that means that it will skip that topic partition when committing, which means that ackedMsgs doesn't get cleared. That means that on the next call to findNextCommitOffset the same thing happens again. The end result is that the spout never commits anything for that topic partition again.\n\nI agree that we should never be in the case where 4 is acked after committedOffset has become larger than 4, which is why I think the else block in L496 should probably log at a higher level than

href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=arunmahadevan\">arunmahadevan</a>:</i>\n<p>> Would be good to do away with StreamBuilder and write it more directly and concisely :<br/>\n> Stream<String> x = new Stream(...).flatmap().blah()</p>\n\n<p>StreamBuilder tracks the overall graph of processors (the topology of processors). Stream abstracts the stream of values flowing through the pipeline (and the operation to be performed on the values). Its better to keep them separate.</p>\n\n<p>for e.g consider a branching operation,</p>\n\n<p>Stream<String> logs = streambuilder.newStream(...);<br/>\nlogs.filter(isError).forEach(savetoErrorFile)<br/>\nlogs.filter(!isError).forEach(doFurtherProcessing)<br/>\nsubmitTopology(..., streambuilder.build());</p>\n\n<p>if you are directly operating on streams, its difficult to translate it to a single storm topology without the stream builder.</p>\n\n<p>> Can we avoid the build() call there<br/>\n> StormSubmitter.submitTopologyWithProgressBar(\"test\", new Config(), builder.build());<br/>\n> and simplify it to<br/>\n> StormSubmitter.submitTopologyWithProgressBar(\"test\", new Config(), stream );<br/>\n> and have the build() or whatever else needs to happen, get invoked internally within submitTopology ?</p>\n\n<p>Like in the example above, there are two streams we are evaluating as a part of the topology. So its easier to have the StreamBuilder abstraction that can build a single topology out of a graph of processors. </p>\n\n<p>> Good to have overloaded version taking arrays in flatMap(T[] ) and elsewhere to natively support arrays... so that conversion via Arrays.asList is not needed.</p>\n\n<p>flatMap takes a function that takes a value of type T and returns an Iterable<R> (not an array). Due to the way overload resolution works with lambdas, its not possible to overload flatMap() to take a function that returns an array. We could have a separate function like flatMapArray(...) to deal with this, but that is also not very elegant and would confuse the users.</p>\n\n<p>>The doc Needs to have a more concrete definition for Stream concept.</p>\n\n<p>Yes we need to add more documentation, README etc. You 've asked good questions, I will try to answer them and later consolidate to a Readme.</p>\n\n<p>> Is it just the data stream produced by the first operator/spout ? or is it the whole pipeline of operators ?</p>\n\n<p>Stream could be thought of as stream of messages (values) flowing through a pipeline. It starts from spout, gets transformed along the way and possibly ends up in a sink.</p>\n\n<p>E.g<br/>\nStream<String> sentences = .... // a stream of sentences coming from a spout<br/>\nStream<String> words = sentences.flatMap(...); // a stream of words <br/>\nwords.to(hbaseBolt); // the stream of words getting saved in hbase </p>\n\n<p>> is it different from what we call 'topology' in storm ?</p>\n\n<p>Yes it a stream of values. the overall operations that you apply on the stream like stream.map.flatmap.print() etc finally gets translated to a storm topology.</p>\n\n<p>> When you say Stream<T> .. what is T ? Is the type of value produced by the terminal operator ? or that of the first ?</p>\n\n<p>T is the type of values flowing across. (if you look at it from implementation point of view, its the type of the value received by that particular processor).</p>\n\n<p>> What if there is a branch/split and each terminal operator creates different types ?</p>\n\n<p>With the branch(..) api, the result type is same as input type. The values are just forwarded to one of the branches.<br/>\nBut one can always do<br/>\nStream<T> s1 = ...<br/>\nStream<R1> s2 = s1.map(T to R1)<br/>\nStream<R2> s3 = s1.map(T to R2)<br/>\nand so on..<br/>\nso s2 will be a stream of values of type R1 and s3 will be a stream of values of type R2. If you then apply some terminal operation on s2 and s3, you will get the respective types in the respective terminal operation.</p>\n\n<p>> Can a stream pick up data from two different sources ? for example from kafka and hdfs.</p>\n\n<p>You could have a kafka stream and hdfs stream and possibly join them.<br/>\nE.g.<br/>\nStream<String> kafkaStream = streamBuilder.newStream(new KafkaSpout(), ...);<br/>\nStream<String> hdfsStream = streamBuilder.newStream(new HdfsSpout(), ...);</p>\n\n<p>kafkaStream.mapToPair(..).join(hdfsStream.mapToPair(...)).print();</p>\n\n<p>StormSubmitter.submitTopology(..., streambuilder.build());</p>\n\n<p>> The diagram in the doc shows fields and shuffle groupings. Not clear from the examples as to how the various gropings will be supported in the API.<br/>\n> Would like to see API examples in doc as how to the grouping and parallelism hints will be expressed in code.</p>\n\n<p>grouping is not exposed as a separate api to keep it simple for now. But it happens behind the scenes when user does a groupByKey (fields grouping on the key), repartition (shuffle grouping), Stream.aggregate (global grouping) and so on.</p>\n\n<p>> Would this API provide a mechanism to use the existing set of Storm spouts and terminal bolts (like KafkaSpout, HdfsSpout, HbaseBolt, etc) ? Or do we need to > have new implementations ?</p>\n\n<p>Yes its possible. But to provide at-least once guarantees the spout/bolts should do anchoring/acking. This needs to be documented.</p>\n\n<p>> How will custom/user-defined operators be supported ?</p>\n\n<p>We could expose an api that accepts a Processor (the built in operations are also handled via processors). This needs to be thought through further before exposing. It can be added incrementally.</p>\n\n<p>>Doc says<br/>\n>windowing defines the batch boundaries<br/>\n>It is fatal mistake to associate batch boundaries with window boundaries.</p>\n\n<p>Can you elaborate?</p>\n\n<p>Windowing provides a logical boundary over the continuous stream of tuples. It splits (or logically groups) the stream of values flowing through the pipeline into batches so that we can apply operations like aggregations, joins etc on the group and emit the results. The transport level batching like how many messages to transport together via the messaging layer or how many tuples should the spout emit in a nextTuple()  call etc is independent.</p>\n\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612925521/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/249298981","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1711#issuecomment-249298981","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1711","id":249298981,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0OTI5ODk4MQ==","user":{"login":"asmaier","id":3169297,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNjkyOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3169297?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmaier","html_url":"https://github.com/asmaier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmaier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmaier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmaier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmaier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmaier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmaier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmaier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmaier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmaier/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-23T20:49:40Z","updated_at":"2016-09-23T20:49:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I created the JIRA ticket STORM-2123 and added an Apache license header.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/249298981/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/249381004","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1679#issuecomment-249381004","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1679","id":249381004,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0OTM4MTAwNA==","user":{"login":"jfenc91","id":3521256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MjEyNTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3521256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfenc91","html_url":"https://github.com/jfenc91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfenc91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfenc91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfenc91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfenc91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfenc91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfenc91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfenc91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfenc91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfenc91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-24T18:48:07Z","updated_at":"2016-09-24T19:02:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@srdo @hmcl I tracked down one source of the \"double acking\" \n\nIt looks like I am being switched to reading from an out of sync replica.

I think an option for a solution would be to have the spout check if the current LEO is behind committedOffset when it hits the else case in findNextCommitOffsets, and if so, it should reset the consumer group's committed offset to the either the LEO or the beginning of the partition, probably depending on a new configuration parameter.

Since we're querying in stream, query is not terminating so according to SQL standard the value shouldn't be changed. But it gives less powerful. When to initialize DataContext defines the boundary to show same datetime across rows. With joining stream, the issue is more complicated.\n\nFor now I just initialize DataContext at the query compilation phase and pass it to components, so that the value of current datetime is static (don't change) across workers in topology. If we would like to make it dynamic, we need to discuss.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/249470807/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/249492603","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1682#issuecomment-249492603","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1682","id":249492603,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0OTQ5MjYwMw==","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-26T06:53:36Z","updated_at":"2016-09-26T06:53:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@arunmahadevan Thanks for the review.

Trident internally uses the batches to strictly order the commits to provide exactly once by replaying the last batch with idempotent updates. Trident does not use micro batching as a way to address the unit of transport batching. IMO, it should be up to the spouts/bolts and the queues to implement the unit of transport batching and transparent to the user's logic.  Micro-batching should be a separate discussion and not mixed with the streaming apis.</p>\n\n<p>>Custom Operators<br/>\n>IMO, how users can do this easily extend the APIs is something that may need upfront thinking as it will impact the design and interfaces. >Otherwise might end up with something that is hard for end users.</p>\n\n<p>At a high level we could expose the processor apis. It can be added incrementally since the processor interfaces are not currently exposed to the user. So we should be able to change it if needed to address the custom operators. But the custom operators should not affect the syntax of the standard stream apis that we provide.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612925529/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/249573260","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1697#issuecomment-249573260","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1697","id":249573260,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0OTU3MzI2MA==","user":{"login":"revans2","id":3441321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDEzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3441321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2","html_url":"https://github.com/revans2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-26T13:44:38Z","updated_at":"2016-09-26T13:44:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Just pulled in the latest set of bug fixes from master.
