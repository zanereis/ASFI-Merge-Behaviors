The linker error I encountered was in D on Linux. To try to clarify, this is what I have done and where I am at:\r\n\r\n- I manually tested my code on Windows by modifying the C++ tutorial server and the nodejs tutorial client. I bundled the client using Webpack and was able to communicate from Firefox and Chrome to the tutorial server over WebSockets.\r\n- I opened the PR and was asked to provide tests.\r\n- On Linux, I modified the C++ cross language test server, nodejs test client, and js test client to add websockets and accept websocket as a command line argument.\r\n- None of the tests work. When I look at the generated network traffic with Wireshark, I don't see the WebSocket handshake like I expect.\r\n- Then still on Linux, I recreated my modified C++ tutorial server and Webpacked tutorial client. Those don't work either and I don't see the WebSocket traffic in Wireshark like I would expect.\r\n- I then tried to modified the D tutorial server on Linux to test WebSockets in order to see if I was running into a Linux platform issue or if there was a difference in behavior between the two language libraries. That is where I ran into the linker error I don't see in Windows.\r\n\r\nSetting aside the last point about D as off-topic since this is a C++ PR, the only thing I can think of is that I am running into some difference between the Linux and Windows socket implementations, or that there is some sort of compression going on that I am not aware of (even though I have tried to turn off per message deflate). Since my Linux development experience is very limited, the biggest hurdle I am running into is trying to get a good debugging environment set up or just even knowing roughly what I should be looking for. I have been struggling with plain command line gdb.\r\n\r\nBased on your suggestion, using CMake, I am trying to get the cross language tests set up and building on Windows, but I am running into build issues there as well.\r\n\r\nI can update the PR with the failing tests if you would like to take a look at what I have.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/624138820/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/624413936","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/2049#issuecomment-624413936","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2049","id":624413936,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNDQxMzkzNg==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-06T02:44:06Z","updated_at":"2020-05-06T02:44:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity.

If there is a closed duplex socket where data was sent from the peer before closing then fwrite will return 0 (the socket is closed) but feof will return false because there is still data to read.  \r\n\r\nIn the patch we are using locally I didn't go that route for two reasons:\r\n\r\n1. I'm don't know enough about the internals of sockets to know if there are some cases where a write of 0 is temporary and a subsequent write would be successful. \r\n2. The implementation of TSocket::read uses the 0 length + feof check so I erred on the side of consistency.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    if ($readable > 0) {\r\n            $data = fread($this->handle_, $len);\r\n            if ($data === false) {\r\n                throw new TTransportException('TSocket: Could not read ' . $len .

We just decided to be really conservative with our initial change as we make tens of thousands of thrift calls per second.\r\n\r\nI can attest that adding the feof check has fixed our issue with stuck php processes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/626209869/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/626403676","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/2038#issuecomment-626403676","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2038","id":626403676,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNjQwMzY3Ng==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-10T23:06:50Z","updated_at":"2020-05-10T23:06:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity.
