I will  try it.   \r\nand  I find another question related to the leader-selection scenari. When zkServer switch the leader and then returns to normal, all clients will execute state switching: connected->suspend->reconn\r\nBecause leaderlatch processing the reconn state will reset leader status, that is mean first set itself leader status false and then  delete old temporary sequence Node and create a new one.   This operation will cause the business side to perform a leader switch multiple.  Some businesses don’t want to see such frequent switchovers happen such as mq.  Also this operation will cause  nodeDeleteEvent push once from zk server but client execute multiple times  nodeDeleteCallback on same path because client saves mutiple watch local(create new path will getchild and listen.  and prenodedeleteEvent also will getchild and listen ). \r\nWhy don't we replace StandardConnectionStateErrorPolicy with SessionConnectionStateErrorPolicy? The above phenomenon will be avoided","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/954646817/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/957782794","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/curator/pull/398#issuecomment-957782794","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/398","id":957782794,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQjg0c45FpsK","user":{"login":"woaishixiaoxiao","id":34100836,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTAwODM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34100836?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/woaishixiaoxiao","html_url":"https://github.com/woaishixiaoxiao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/woaishixiaoxiao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/woaishixiaoxiao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/woaishixiaoxiao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/woaishixiaoxiao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/woaishixiaoxiao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/woaishixiaoxiao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/woaishixiaoxiao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/woaishixiaoxiao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/woaishixiaoxiao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-02T15:09:07Z","updated_at":"2021-11-02T15:09:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> @woaishixiaoxiao thanks for sharing your fix, do you think that we can add a test case to cover this change ?\r\n\r\nHI i have added a unit test. please approval thanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/957782794/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604781914","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/curator/issues/1080#issuecomment-2604781914","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/1080","id":2604781914,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQjg0c6bQdFa","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-03T18:58:03Z","updated_at":"2025-01-21T13:46:01Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=scott-kirk\">scott-kirk</a>:</i>\n<p><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=randgalt\" class=\"user-hover\" rel=\"randgalt\">Jordan Zimmerman</a> <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=cammckenzie\" class=\"user-hover\" rel=\"cammckenzie\">Cam McKenzie</a> I tried to make a patch for this: <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/curator/pull/400\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/curator/pull/400</a> .

However, there is nothing in the LeaderLatch code that actually generates any kind of randomness. In the current implementation, the LeaderLatch is operating more as a leadership queue than an election system, always choosing the next in line based on when a process joined the participant pool instead of randomly. By adding a random factor into the internal election process, the behavior will now match the documentation and it will avoid \"clumping\" of leadership among the longest-running servers/processes.</p>\n\n<p>In my particular case, we have a group of four servers that are contending for leadership of a larger number of jobs, in my case, delivering data to external clients through various interfaces.(I'll use 20 in this example) Because the jobs are managed separately, each has its own LeaderLatch associated with it. When enabling the jobs, we can assign them to specific servers on startup to balance the load, so each server will initially be leader for 5 tasks, with the other servers ready to take over in the event of a server outage. When applying patches, updates, or other routine maintenance activities, we generally do a rolling restart, allowing the jobs to be automatically re-distributed to the currently running servers, minimizing downtime. However, each time we bring a server down, all of its jobs go to the server that has been up the longest, since it has the lowest sequentially-numbered node for all of the LeaderLatches. After rolling through all of the servers, the first server that was restarted will now be leader of all 100 jobs, with the other servers idle. We're now forced to manually disable and re-enable most of the jobs to force them to redistribute among the servers, a much slower process than if the leadership had been randomly re-assigned.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604790552/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604790557","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/curator/issues/1139#issuecomment-2604790557","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/1139","id":2604790557,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQjg0c6bQfMd","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-14T08:52:14Z","updated_at":"2025-01-21T13:49:37Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=randgalt\">randgalt</a>:</i>\n<p>> There is no reason to believe that the instances contending for a latch are random in many operational environments</p>\n\n<p>Why not?
