It can really mess up operability if some monitoring application is expecting a port and Gobblin silently runs on a different port.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/188534895/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/188535754","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/705#issuecomment-188535754","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/705","id":188535754,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4ODUzNTc1NA==","user":{"login":"eogren","id":5913279,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MTMyNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5913279?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eogren","html_url":"https://github.com/eogren","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eogren/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eogren/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eogren/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eogren/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eogren/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eogren/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eogren/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eogren/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eogren/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-25T00:40:25Z","updated_at":"2016-02-25T00:40:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Overall looks pretty neat to me!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/188535754/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/188536064","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/752#issuecomment-188536064","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/752","id":188536064,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4ODUzNjA2NA==","user":{"login":"kadaan","id":1904898,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDQ4OTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1904898?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan","html_url":"https://github.com/kadaan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-25T00:41:26Z","updated_at":"2016-02-25T00:41:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I will also add a strict mode.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/188536064/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/188557384","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/749#issuecomment-188557384","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/749","id":188557384,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4ODU1NzM4NA==","user":{"login":"ydai1124","id":10764942,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzY0OTQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10764942?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydai1124","html_url":"https://github.com/ydai1124","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydai1124/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydai1124/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydai1124/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydai1124/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydai1124/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydai1124/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydai1124/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydai1124/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydai1124/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-25T01:51:40Z","updated_at":"2016-02-25T01:51:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Minor comments.

This looks a big gun for people to shoot themselves in the foot. I don't see a reason to ignore the previous state. \n\nIn this particular case, actually I think it is a short-coming of how state is stored currently for the FileBasedSource . The file name is not sufficient. We also need the file modification timestamp. Then the source should compare both names and timestamps of previously processed files and currently existing files.\n\nOne possible approach is to\n- Define a class TimestampedFile contains of a file path string and a long last modification timestamp\n- Define equals(), hashValue() in the natural way using both the path and the timestamp.\n- A TimestampedFile is serialized to a string as a \"<path>:::<timestamp>\". \n- Similarly, a TimestampedFile can be created for the above string. For backwards compatibility, if :::<timestamp> is missing, we can assume 0 timestamp.\n- ReUse the existing SOURCE_FILEBASED_FS_SNAPSHOT property but make it a list the string serializations of TimestampedFile\n- getcurrentFsSnapshot() should return a Collection<TimestampedFile>\n- When computing filesToPull we should use a HashSet instead of the current List to make removeAll() efficient.\n- If we define TimestampedFile.equals() as above, the removeAll() will do the right thing and keep a file for pulling if the name has remained the same but the modification timestamp has changed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/188573495/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/188578590","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/727#issuecomment-188578590","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/727","id":188578590,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4ODU3ODU5MA==","user":{"login":"sahilTakiar","id":1282583,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODI1ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1282583?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar","html_url":"https://github.com/sahilTakiar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-25T02:59:02Z","updated_at":"2016-02-25T02:59:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Agreed,

I'm not sure how this is going to solve the scenario where Azkaban executes a SLA kill on the job. Looking at `MRJobLauncher.cancelJob` only tries to kill the Hadoop job, but doesn't try to cancel anything else like the `Publisher` or `StateStore` serialization. So if `cancelJob` is invoked while the alias is created, the alias creation will probably continue to run until Azkaban just invokes a `kill -9` on the process. And we will just hit the same `EOFException`.\n\nAny ideas? If we could use a RDMS instead I feel like DB transactions would make this a lot easier.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/188597973/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/188702584","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/727#issuecomment-188702584","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/727","id":188702584,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4ODcwMjU4NA==","user":{"login":"pldash","id":11637052,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM3MDUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11637052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pldash","html_url":"https://github.com/pldash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pldash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pldash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pldash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pldash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pldash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pldash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pldash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pldash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pldash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-25T10:07:00Z","updated_at":"2016-02-25T10:07:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@chavdar Is it really required to create a new class TimestampedFile.

updated, the only real change is that `copyPath` now catches `Throwable` instead of `Exception`, and I added a shutdown hook in `AbstractJobLauncher` to interrupt the main thread.\n\nAdding a feature to `FsDatasetStateStore` to treat a `tableName` as `current` equivalent to the latest `.jst` files is slightly more difficult that originally thought, and the solution is a little hacky. The methods `getLatestDatasetState` and `getLatestDatasetStatesByUrns` would both have to be modified. The problem is that each dataset will have its own `-current.jst` file, I can explain more in person.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/189396258/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/189399810","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/767#issuecomment-189399810","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/767","id":189399810,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4OTM5OTgxMA==","user":{"login":"sahilTakiar","id":1282583,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODI1ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1282583?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar","html_url":"https://github.com/sahilTakiar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-26T18:03:13Z","updated_at":"2016-02-26T18:03:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@muratoda

If we schedule a job to run every 15 minutes and it takes longer than 15 minutes, a failure will be logged to the history DB.  Additionally, if we want to run the job \"constantly\" we schedule it to run once a minute.  This ensures that we process \"constantly\", but can cause a huge number of job failures to be recorded in the history DB.\n\nI believe there are several ways to properly deal with the problems that can arise from the lock.  These are important whether skipping is enabled or not.  First, the job lock should require a heartbeat so that jobs that have crashed, frozen, or had machine die don't prevent the system from making progress.  Second, there should be metrics which indicate the number of job which are skipped or failed within a given unit of time.  This can be used to raise an alert to indicate that a problem exists with the job.  Third, the job run time can also be used to determine if there is a fundamental problem with the job in regards to the schedule and the amount of work to be done.  Lastly, SLAs can be use to determine if the job is healthy and processing correctly.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/191089640/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/191098658","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/764#issuecomment-191098658","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/764","id":191098658,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MTA5ODY1OA==","user":{"login":"kadaan","id":1904898,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDQ4OTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1904898?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan","html_url":"https://github.com/kadaan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-02T07:02:39Z","updated_at":"2016-03-02T07:02:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@sahilTakiar I looked at this again and I think I can accomplish my goals without the new setting.
