None of the apichecker will work if you've a commands.properties file in classpath but have dynamic.apichecker.enabled set to true. Try git clean -fdx to get rid of non-tracked files, or do a `find` and remove commands.properties file.\n- Check role_id column in cloud.accounts table, it should be `1` for root admin accounts.

Thanks for the quick fix.\n\nAnother issue:\nWith the remade apache config generation, i see you are either putting multiple Listen directives or not cleaning up some. Hence apache fails to start with \"Address already in use: make_sock: could not bind to address 172.30.0.11:80\"\n\n```\nroot@r-74-VM:~# grep -r Listen /etc/apache2/\n\n/etc/apache2/ports.conf:Listen 172.30.0.11:80\n/etc/apache2/ports.conf:    Listen 172.30.0.11:443\n/etc/apache2/ports.conf:    Listen 172.30.0.11:443\n/etc/apache2/vhostexample.conf:Listen 10.1.1.1:80\n/etc/apache2/vhostexample.conf:    Listen 10.1.1.1:443\n/etc/apache2/vhostexample.conf:    Listen 10.1.1.1:443\n/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/vhost-172.30.0.11.conf:Listen 172.30.0.11:80\n/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/vhost-172.30.0.11.conf:Listen 172.30.0.11:443\n/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/vhost-172.30.0.11.conf:Listen 172.30.0.11:443\n```\n\nPutting Listen to ports.conf is enough, no need to add them to the vhosts themselves.\n\nCurrently this breaks metadata service on the VR\n\nAlso, i'm still checking the multiple subnets per vlan functionality (specifically dhcp) on my setup. Since we also need that right now, and i'm not sure if it's working for me yet. I'll get back on that soon, when i have specific info (trying to debug / understand the changes from these commits )\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/220014434/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/220019059","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/816#issuecomment-220019059","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/816","id":220019059,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMDAxOTA1OQ==","user":{"login":"mike-tutkowski","id":3019295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMTkyOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3019295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski","html_url":"https://github.com/mike-tutkowski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-18T13:03:07Z","updated_at":"2016-05-18T13:03:07Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi @anshul1886 Can you be more specific about the class that is given you problems and the variables?

We've put a lot of testing effort on this including various upgrade scenarios, and have seen huge amount of effort on code review so it is not needed to revert the feature; though if there is a valid bug it ought to be fixed and that's what freeze is about -- fixing bugs.\n\nHere what I'm speculating where it is failing:\nDeveloper sets up CloudStack with a db schema prior to when RBAC was merged. Then, the developer rebuilds CloudStack but does not redeploy a fresh/clean db, and commands.properties.in is removed so his static-checker won't work. The root admin with role_id=1 is by default allowed all APIs in the dynamic checker so the feature ensures that root-admin is never locked out of the system. The developers ought to cleanly rebuild CloudStack and re-deploy a fresh db after a rebase in their feature branch or on master.\n\nLastly, even after request I'm yet to see some valid logs, exception, screenshots etc from @anshul1886 that would help me debug and fix the issue, if any.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/220090191/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/220090972","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1489#issuecomment-220090972","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1489","id":220090972,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMDA5MDk3Mg==","user":{"login":"swill","id":13644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill","html_url":"https://github.com/swill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-18T16:57:36Z","updated_at":"2016-05-18T16:57:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I agree.

In case of debian packages, the commands.properties file is already installed at the /etc path. This ensures people will continue to use static-checker after the upgrade, and commands.properties file will exist at /etc/cloudstack/management.\n- Reduces the cloudstack-common rpm size by half, by no bundling systemvm.zip file. This file is not needed and we don't package it in debian packages.\n- Since #1054 we're using mysql connector python, the last patch fixes the dynamic-roles migration tool/script to use mysql.connector as well.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/220236481/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/220237502","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1489#issuecomment-220237502","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1489","id":220237502,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMDIzNzUwMg==","user":{"login":"anshul1886","id":1712815,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MTI4MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1712815?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886","html_url":"https://github.com/anshul1886","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-19T06:20:49Z","updated_at":"2016-05-19T06:24:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@rhtyd Default value for dynamic.apichecker.enabled is true. role_id for default account is 1.
