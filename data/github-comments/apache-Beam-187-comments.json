don't think the technical portrayal of Travis is accurate here. We did hit some actual issues (a bit improved now with auto cancelation) but we were trying to use a wrench to hammer a nail. It is easy to use Travis in a way so that you have ~zero cost for a little benefit. It doesn't need to scale if you don't try to do everything. I view our failure to benefit from Travis as almost entirely our fault.\r\n\r\nThis discussion and decision about whether and how we choose to utilize the tool do not belong on a PR. I started this PR just to mitigate the Jenkins outage; now we don't have that option without flipping it back on anyhow so I am just going to close the PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/298096958/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/298099065","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/2767#issuecomment-298099065","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/2767","id":298099065,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5ODA5OTA2NQ==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-28T20:29:40Z","updated_at":"2017-04-28T20:29:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\n[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/builds/11296390/badge)](https://coveralls.io/builds/11296390)\n\nCoverage decreased (-0.007%) to 69.676% when pulling **fb3ae18a2707575bcd206720e9fcb7b3be3a60dd on meunierd:BEAM-2114** into **f9406c76657e7dc6cd094b1e7281242e3f5fc9e9 on apache:master**.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/298099065/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/298100156","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/2729#issuecomment-298100156","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/2729","id":298100156,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5ODEwMDE1Ng==","user":{"login":"jkff","id":343722,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MzcyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/343722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff","html_url":"https://github.com/jkff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-28T20:34:51Z","updated_at":"2017-04-28T20:34:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@aljoscha SDF code does not inspect watermarks, it only sets watermark holds.
