I think LogLevel is a better/generic name to suppress a field from getting logged. Currently only sensitive field is getting annotated with it. Going forward some non-sensitive field may also be annotated if someone wants to prevent it from getting logged. Also since LogLevel is already used in agent commands, having an uniform approach throughout the code is always better and creates less confusion.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/153690547/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/153690595","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1021#issuecomment-153690595","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1021","id":153690595,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MzY5MDU5NQ==","user":{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-04T11:22:22Z","updated_at":"2015-11-04T11:22:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@DaanHoogland if you look at the changes or the code that takes in Object (Response object) and serializes it; we create the json or xml response string by manually adding the delimiters ({, }, <, >, : characters etc).

I greatly appreciate the work @nlivens and you have done to contribute this capability to the community.  This plugin highlights a larger issue which is that, as a community, we are delivering releases containing code that cannot be verified.

In fact, we haven't, and they may be attempting to use something that is completely broken.\n\n@mlsorensen yes, plugins provide a mechanism for vendors to extend CloudStack.  However, there is no requirement for those plugins to be part of the community, OSS codebase.  Therefore, we should not conflate the ability of third-parties to extend CloudStack using plugins with the code that is accepted as part of the community's repositories.  All code in our repositories, regardless of being in the core or a plugin, should be held to the same standards.

For example, I reviewed the code for this plugin, and while I feel confident that it will behave well within the management server, I have absolutely no idea if the various network functions are being properly automated using the Nuage client APIs.  The only way for those aspects of the plugin's operation to be verified would be to run in a test environment with a Nuage device and realize a set of network topologies.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/153822915/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/153830070","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/801#issuecomment-153830070","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/801","id":153830070,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MzgzMDA3MA==","user":{"login":"remibergsma","id":1630096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzAwOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1630096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma","html_url":"https://github.com/remibergsma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-04T18:56:35Z","updated_at":"2015-11-04T18:56:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This PR will be merged once 4.6.0 is out and together with some other cool features (I counted at least 5 of them that have pull requests that are almost ready to be merged) it will become 4.7.0.\n\nAfter 4.6.0 is out we'll start to see the benefit of all te hard work to make master stable: we will deliver another stable release (4.7.0) in say a month with new cool features.

There should probably be a basic list of\nitems to look for so that the reviews themselves can be standardized. I\nthink that would also address the concern I have for the community culture,\nbecause contributors will fear the review process less if they can see up\nfront what the criteria are for merge.

It is more flexible for them. They can release new packages with new feature/improvement and bug fix, no need to wait for official cloudstack release.\nI also understand their concern that the code difference between their branch and master branch will become more and more bigger if they cannot merge most of their codes to main branch. It will be difficult to upgrade to new cloudstack versio. The upgrade means a lot of work, especially if there is framework refactoring. I believe many companies have their cloudstack branch with new features and customized UI , and they face the issue when they want new features and upgrade to new version.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/154363971/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/154383035","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1038#issuecomment-154383035","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1038","id":154383035,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NDM4MzAzNQ==","user":{"login":"DaanHoogland","id":2486961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODY5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2486961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland","html_url":"https://github.com/DaanHoogland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-06T11:10:13Z","updated_at":"2015-11-06T11:10:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bhaisaab the sprites seem not to have changed.
