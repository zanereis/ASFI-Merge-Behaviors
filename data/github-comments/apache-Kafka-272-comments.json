@junrao Thanks for helping with the review! I wanted to rebase earlier but got delayed due to the busy oncall week. I should be able to rebase/test the patch and review it myself again by this Friday. Hope we can get this reviewed and committed soon instead of another major rebase :)\r\n\r\n@junrao Thanks for the suggestion. It is definitely useful for the admin to be able to fix the bad disk while the broker is running. I think it requires a new KIP in addition to KIP-112 and KIP-113 because it takes new tool script and notification event which is not currently included in those two KIPs. Is it OK for me work on this as a new KIP after KIP-112 and KIP-113 is completed?\r\n\r\nThe handling of I/O exception in mmap seems similar to the sixth future work mentioned in KIP-112 wiki, i.e. handling various failure scenario case-by-case. KIP-112 currently only handles disk failure that can be caught in the form of IOException instead of JVM crash. I will think about how to handle this I/O exception and let you know my answer.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/306989136/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/306990183","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/3131#issuecomment-306990183","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/3131","id":306990183,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNjk5MDE4Mw==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-08T03:44:27Z","updated_at":"2017-06-08T03:44:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer to this link for build results (access rights to CI server needed): \nhttps://builds.apache.org/job/kafka-pr-jdk8-scala2.12/5039/\nTest PASSed (JDK 8 and Scala 2.12).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/306990183/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/306991162","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/3262#issuecomment-306991162","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/3262","id":306991162,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNjk5MTE2Mg==","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-08T03:53:19Z","updated_at":"2017-06-08T03:53:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM.
