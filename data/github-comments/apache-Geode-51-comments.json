I've opened a draft [PR](https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/5463) with your test and made a simple change within the `DiskStoreImpl` class, which seems to address this issue more easily with less impact (see [here](https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/5463/files#diff-05e3599f18f88368a85d5fbd987a1094L463)). Can you have a look and let me know your thoughts?.\r\n> I've also added some extra reviewers as they have some more knowledge around the `disk-store` area and the related `gfsh` commands.\r\n\r\nHi @jujoramos ,\r\nI agree with you and your proposal, as it will include less changes with less impact.\r\nI tested your changes and will create a new PR with your proposal and tests.\r\nThank you for a help!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/677527803/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/677529060","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/5175#issuecomment-677529060","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/5175","id":677529060,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3NzUyOTA2MA==","user":{"login":"jujoramos","id":8254001,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNTQwMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8254001?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jujoramos","html_url":"https://github.com/jujoramos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jujoramos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jujoramos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jujoramos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jujoramos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jujoramos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jujoramos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jujoramos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jujoramos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jujoramos/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-20T11:04:34Z","updated_at":"2020-08-20T11:04:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sounds good @mkevo, thanks for the update and sorry for all the back and forth, I wish I have had spotted the single line fix before to spare you some time :-/.
