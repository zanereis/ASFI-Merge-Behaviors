Anyone who has rights to create a dashboard has the ensuing ability to edit any chart they can view, no?\r\n- Should ownership be part of the permissions model, or more of a label on an object indicating who is responsible for it? Ownership should probably stand firmly on one side of that spectrum, and not in the middle. If we need both \"permissions\" ownership and \"responsibility\" ownership, maybe those should be two separate things.\r\n- What if there was a flow to easily replace someone else's chart in your dashboard with a clone that you own? Or to assign a dashboard as an \"owner\" of a chart? I think it's possible to find a solution that fits all user needs.\r\n- Superset needs a user testing/feedback infrastructure to verify these kinds of ideas.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/615550879/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/615563713","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/8686#issuecomment-615563713","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/8686","id":615563713,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxNTU2MzcxMw==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-18T05:08:51Z","updated_at":"2020-04-18T05:08:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity.

It's worth keeping in mind that adding `url_params` to the cache key will invalidate the cache key for every query/chart in a dashboard if a query parameter is added to the URL, even if it is not used by the query. It is for this purpose that `cache_key_wrapper` was added, ie. making sure that any additional variable that needs to be considered in the query is considered in the cache key. Given the fact that using `cache_key_wrapper` can solve this problem without impacting other charts/queries, I would propose using that for now.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/616206574/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/616207192","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/9584#issuecomment-616207192","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/9584","id":616207192,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxNjIwNzE5Mg==","user":{"login":"villebro","id":33317356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzE3MzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33317356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro","html_url":"https://github.com/villebro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-19T18:56:56Z","updated_at":"2020-04-19T18:56:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for reporting @karen-pal , I will investigate asap.

The behavior I wanted to describe: say if both you and I are the owner of a dashboard, and I create a brand new chart and add it to this dashboard, you'd become the owner of it. Currently this would only happen once I go in the dashboard and save it (it cascades ownership to charts). It's very likely I would go and position that new chart in the dash and save it, so the gap here is pretty small. Also you saving that dashboard for whatever reasons would cascade ownership too.\r\n- Currently ownership is part of the models ifself (many-to-many) while other non-resource-specific perms like can-read, can-modify, can-delete are part of RBAC. Business logic applies all required checks on actions. Seems ok to me. Ownership and ownership checks are [mostly] consistent across object types (charts, query, dashboard) and the same model / logic applies.\r\n- sounds tricky / complicated, users own chart seem better than dashboard owns chart\r\n- more tests around RBAC / ownerships would be great, I think we do make sure that non-owners cannot update / delete things, but not sure how well that's covered in tests\r\n\r\nI think the current model that is \"if you own the dashboard, we make you also own all of the charts in it\" is good. We need to make it clear that this is the case (at least when adding owners to a dashboard).\r\n\r\nI have yet to hear a user say \"I really want to make this user an owner of my dashboard, but only want to allow that person to modify a subset of the charts in my dashboard\". Personally I don't think we need to support that for now, and that it leads to confusing situations / more complex UI to enable that.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/616224064/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/616232218","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/9582#issuecomment-616232218","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/9582","id":616232218,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxNjIzMjIxOA==","user":{"login":"john-bodley","id":4567245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjcyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4567245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley","html_url":"https://github.com/john-bodley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-19T22:02:11Z","updated_at":"2020-04-19T22:04:11Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@villebro how do you want to proceed? I think are approaches are similar except you have the added step of `split_adhoc_filters_into_base_filters(...)`. \r\n\r\nI realize that the filter logic is is somewhat unpleasant as we still have ad-hoc (current) and base (previous) versions of the filters. I did think about re-converting the ad-hoc filters into base filters but felt that this was a step in the wrong direction. \r\n\r\nOrthogonal to this PR I think these ad-hoc filters should be a class as it feels fragile dealing with a non-typed dictionary for defining filters. We should also remove the code of the base filters and thus the only conversion which would be needed is for transforming old URLs. There's also been discussion of encoding a version number in the form-data which would make upgrading between versions somewhat trivial.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/616232218/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/616235403","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/9572#issuecomment-616235403","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/9572","id":616235403,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxNjIzNTQwMw==","user":{"login":"john-bodley","id":4567245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjcyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4567245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley","html_url":"https://github.com/john-bodley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-19T22:25:48Z","updated_at":"2020-04-19T22:25:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@villebro I agree with your point (and noted) that the presence of a URL parameter does not mean it will be used by the query but per the documentation, \r\n\r\n> As you create a visualization form this SQL Lab query, you can pass parameters in the explore view as well as from the dashboard, and it should carry through to your queries.\r\n> \r\n> Default values for URL parameters can be defined in chart metadata by adding the key-value pair `url_params: {'foo': 'bar'}` \r\n\r\nI perceive one would expect that if one were using them as defined they wouldn't expect the cached payload to be incorrect, i.e., it feels like a bug if they didn't know they needed to wrap the call with `cache_key_wrapper`. \r\n\r\nMaybe there's a common ground we could agree on (however I wasn't able to get it working but maybe you could shed some light on maybe how to do it).

Users can edit the scopes of a table chart with filter events in the dashboard's filter scope editor\r\n\r\nI am not sure you tested all **_filter related_** use cases. There are some pretty complicated logic for filter_box's and filter's scope:\r\n- add/remove a _filter viz_ from a dashboard, \r\n- move a chart in/out of a tab with filter scope,\r\n- move filter to a different dashboard layout position,\r\n- filter indicators to show what values are applied and by which filter component.\r\n- more...\r\n\r\nI want to make table filter as simple as possible, otherwise it's really hard to maintain the majority usage. I suggest:\r\n- Filter scope modal should not cover table filter, table filter should apply to all charts in dashboard (global scope only), \r\n- table filter should not be saved as default_filters in dashboard metadata\r\n- dashboard doesn't persist table filter's current state. for example, when you click `share dashboard` and share a shorten dashboard link, you will lose current table filter's selection.\r\n\r\nNo matter you want to make table filter fully work as filter_box filter or not, please add some unit tests and Cypress e2e tests for table filters, to show what functions that table filter will support.\r\n\r\n@mistercrunch ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/617008945/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/617019842","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/9563#issuecomment-617019842","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/9563","id":617019842,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxNzAxOTg0Mg==","user":{"login":"vdmitriyev","id":2291074,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTEwNzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2291074?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdmitriyev","html_url":"https://github.com/vdmitriyev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdmitriyev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdmitriyev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdmitriyev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdmitriyev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdmitriyev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdmitriyev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdmitriyev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdmitriyev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdmitriyev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-21T07:59:32Z","updated_at":"2020-04-21T07:59:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@cyang52 do you have the database, which can be accessed by your installation?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/617019842/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/617021873","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/9597#issuecomment-617021873","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/9597","id":617021873,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxNzAyMTg3Mw==","user":{"login":"Pinimo","id":14152858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTUyODU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14152858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pinimo","html_url":"https://github.com/Pinimo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pinimo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pinimo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pinimo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pinimo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pinimo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pinimo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pinimo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pinimo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pinimo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-21T08:03:28Z","updated_at":"2020-04-21T08:03:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @jayhjha, thank you for looking into this.

`it doesn't throw errors` is not good enough. Dashboard will _persist_ some information in its metadata, default_filters, layout, filter scopes., etc into **dashboards** table. For example, a chart was a filter with filter but then it became non-filter chart...then how about those persisted metadata? For the long term it will cause data quality issue and many potential bugs.\r\n\r\nI mean, it's the same as removing a FilterBox from the dashboard. Do we do anything special right now for filter boxes when they are removed from the dashboard? My point is, there is no need for special treatment. If we think outdated metadata would be an issue, then it must be an issue for FilterBox, too.\r\n\r\n`It doesn't throw errors` was referring to the case you described---when a filter chart is removed from dashboard but the dashboard still persists metadata related to it. IMO, as long as the initialization process can safely ignore the outdated metadata when it realizes the related slice ID is not a filter chart, it's OK to leave the small pieces of metadata in persistent storage, just in case users want to change the same slice to a filter chart again.\r\n\r\nI'm OK with NOT merging this fix if we think there are too much trouble or a better solution down the line.\r\n\r\n@mistercrunch , question for you and @bolkedebruin ,\r\n\r\n> Under which use cases [a filter table] is irreplaceable by a FilterBox?\r\n\r\nIt seems there is a significant risk to future maintenance cost if we reintroduce this feature. Kind of feel we should deprecate it for now until we have a better idea on how to make this more robust.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/617418414/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/617448651","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/9346#issuecomment-617448651","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/9346","id":617448651,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxNzQ0ODY1MQ==","user":{"login":"craig-rueda","id":2595291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTUyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2595291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda","html_url":"https://github.com/craig-rueda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-21T22:35:50Z","updated_at":"2020-04-21T22:35:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@fbalicchia - can you rebase with master?
