I am just not a big fan of copying things back and forth (especially in \"prepareSnaoshot()\", which we want to keep as lightweight as possible). Instead, can we have the contract that the offset committers always commit \"+1\" from the value they get (pretty much as it was in the 0.9 committer after FLINK-4618)?\n\nConcerning the tests, is the stability issue fixed there?\nWhat I frequently do is push the same commit to 10 different newly created branches to keep Travis busy over night with 10 test runs and see if I see a stability issue.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/251449954/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/251483753","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2578#issuecomment-251483753","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2578","id":251483753,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MTQ4Mzc1Mw==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-04T19:11:04Z","updated_at":"2016-10-04T19:11:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think this is good.

If you have 2 concurrent notifies going on you would pass the same FrontMetricGroup to the reporter, hence for both calls the reporter would work on the same referenced MetricGroup, even though they may be supposed to be different ones.\n\nI would propose keeping the current approach of creating a new FrontMetricGroup every time. This means you can simplify that class a lot, since you can now extend `ProxyMetricGroup`, and pass the index through the constructor as well. I don't see a solution where we can get away without creating a new object or putting the entire notification inside a synchronized block (which would be a no-go).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/251640893/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/251654871","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2430#issuecomment-251654871","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2430","id":251654871,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MTY1NDg3MQ==","user":{"login":"twalthr","id":5746567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDY1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5746567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr","html_url":"https://github.com/twalthr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-05T12:00:41Z","updated_at":"2016-10-05T12:00:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mushketyk thanks.

I hope I could fix all the feedback you gave me. I also added documentation for the website in my last commit.\n\nRegarding the two big changes you mentioned:\n1. IMHO window properties also summarize the data. So they can be considered as an aggregation of the data in a window. I also chose this approach to keep the code clean and readable (window properties and aggregations have more in common than window properties and grouping keys). Otherwise we have to somehow hack the window property into the record after the aggregation happened. I will try to improve this but I'm not sure if the outcome will be a nicer solution.\n2. Once #2595 is merged I will rebase this PR and convert ITCases to unit tests.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/252205364/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/252252454","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2605#issuecomment-252252454","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2605","id":252252454,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MjI1MjQ1NA==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-07T13:30:53Z","updated_at":"2016-10-07T13:30:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Updated,

Looks good to me! A couple of things I noticed: \n- The prefix of the interfaces (`Access*`) could be a bit confusing. What about these?\n  - interface: `ExecutionGraph`\n  - runtime:`RuntimeExecutionGraph`\n  - archive: `ArchivedExecutionGraph` \n  \n  That said, you probably chose to not rename the existing `ExecutionGraph` class to minimize changes.\n- How about having an interface `Archiveable<T extends Serializable>` containing the `T archive()` method? This interface could be implemented by all runtime classes which are archievable.\n- You chose not to port the `ExecutionConfig` or `ExecutionConfigSummary` to your changes while rebasing?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/252605040/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
