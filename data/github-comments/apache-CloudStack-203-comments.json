Therefore the server isn't listening at all and the connection cannot be made. The flag `_isRunning` must be turned `true` before submitting the task/thread.\r\n\r\nI still digging into Nio thread handler as we are experiencing some problem in production when quite a few agents try to connect at the same time to a management server.
