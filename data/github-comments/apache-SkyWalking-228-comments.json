For Java libraries' component IDs, we have this test to verify https://github.com/apache/skywalking/blob/2b9de2007f4ae2004765bbbf0437ee9fe4bcb227/oap-server/server-bootstrap/src/test/java/org/apache/skywalking/oap/server/starter/ComponentLibrariesTest.java#L39 , but in this case, we usually need to modify more file than `component-libraries.yml`, so the CI checks won't be skipped.\r\n\r\n- For non-Java components, we have no chance to check them at all actually, for example, malformed YAML like \r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nNginx:\r\n  id: 6000\r\n  languages: Lua\r\nKong:\r\n  id: 6001\r\n   languages: Lua # has one more space here\r\n```\r\n\r\ncan be detected when parsing the file, but YAML like \r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nNginx:\r\n  id: 6000\r\n  languages: Lua\r\n  Kong: # the entire section is indented as a child of Nginx section\r\n    id: 6001\r\n    languages: Lua # has one more space here\r\n```\r\n\r\ncannot be detected at all because it's also valid YAML and since we only read `Nginx.id` and `Nginx.languages`, and we don't know there is `Kong`, hence the other properties `Kong` is ignored.\r\n\r\nTherefore, for non-Java component IDs, malformed YAML cannot be detected unless developers add the E2E tests and put component id assertions in the tests, which I believe we have that currently, for example, Go2Sky E2E, PHP E2E, Python E2E, etc.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/819173449/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/819173910","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/6748#issuecomment-819173910","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/6748","id":819173910,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxOTE3MzkxMA==","user":{"login":"kezhenxu94","id":15965696,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTY1Njk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15965696?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94","html_url":"https://github.com/kezhenxu94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-14T02:23:02Z","updated_at":"2021-04-14T02:23:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"That
