I do appreciate the idea of consistency and I personally like it a lot, but I'm not sure how aligned is with other devops teams . \n\nA docker-compose approach may  also be used for integration tests between components.

Feedback on our deployment technologies is always very appreciated we're looking to make it as easy as possible for ourselves aswell. \n\nTwo thoughts to docker-compose and your comments:\n1. We've been on docker 1.9 for a reason. It's not because the deployment otherwise doesn't work, but we had issues with docker 1.10 and 1.11 in our production systems, which seem to be resolved with 1.12, which is why we're currently in the progress of migrating to it. Hopefully we'll be able to give green light to update all developer setups as well.\n2. We've also looked at docker-compose as a deployment tool (actually, I personally did the prototypes for docker-compose, ansible, chef etc.). I found that ansible is basically a superset of docker-compose (it really is with the newest version of the docker module) with a bit more flexibility when it comes to setting up VMs the way we want it, copying files around etc. All in all: The decision was deliberate.\n\nFeedback as I said is of course always welcome and I'm happy to give feedback on the docker-compose version of our deployment. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/249016873/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/249018587","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/426#issuecomment-249018587","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/426","id":249018587,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0OTAxODU4Nw==","user":{"login":"dubee","id":11520887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIwODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11520887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee","html_url":"https://github.com/dubee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-22T20:28:50Z","updated_at":"2016-09-22T20:29:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Added key/value labels and encoded the JSON.

there a way to add multiple travis builds in a pipeline kind of way?\nI am wondering because there is (besides the number of runtimes) in general the natural problem of ever increasing number of tests which will by definition at some point hit a time limit that is unacceptable.\n\nWe are currently executing the majority of tests in one huge suite in `:tests:test` which is also a nuisance if you want to e.g. update just documentation (which should also be tested btw.)\n\nSo if we were able to split those into smaller but faster pieces - for example with a pluggable runtime, but not necessarily stop there - be awesome. \n\nIf that does not work, my only other idea would be to split into multiple repos and assign one travis build for each repo and have them pick up each other.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/249120635/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/249161225","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/1316#issuecomment-249161225","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1316","id":249161225,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0OTE2MTIyNQ==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-23T10:52:37Z","updated_at":"2016-09-23T10:52:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@markusthoemmes

from discussion with @psuter today:\n\nIt might be going too far to define the empty object {} as an abort condition for sequences, since it's easy to imagine lots of actions that run correctly with empty inputs.   This is especially true when you consider that we can specify default values for parameters.\n\nPhilippe reminded me that we already have a convention that if the return object contains a field called \"error\", we have a convention that this indicates erroneous completion and terminates the sequence.\n\nPerhaps it would be better to use this kind of convention.   For example, perhaps we could further adopt the convention that if the value of \"error\" is `null`, then it aborts the sequence, but for the purposes of logging, this is not considered a real error.   Alternatively we could reserve another keyword (abort?  exit? stop?) ... however maybe we should avoid reserving more keywords since each such keyword increases the chances that someone uses the keyword by accident.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/249661657/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/249683277","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/1310#issuecomment-249683277","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1310","id":249683277,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0OTY4MzI3Nw==","user":{"login":"ioana-blue","id":17202292,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjAyMjky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17202292?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue","html_url":"https://github.com/ioana-blue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-26T20:12:03Z","updated_at":"2016-09-26T20:29:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"~~It turns out the two tests for sequences and parameters in ActionsApiTests are broken.
