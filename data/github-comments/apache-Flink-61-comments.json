The main problem is that  StreamOperatorState can be defined dynamically during runtime and thus, we need to allow dynamic checkpointers along with the operator states and include them in the state handles. \n\nAn alternative take which is slightly more restrictive is to enforce the user to pre-define all mappings from custom operator state names to checkpointers so we can configure these in the tasks themselves (kept in the execution graph once) instead of including them on each state handle. \nApart from this concern the PR is well tested and documented!\nAny other

The triggers are part of some tests only, because this is a unit test that checks many features independently.\n- There are two tests that validate behavior of triggers (regular case and exception case). Both hang with out a trigger.\n- Many tests test parameterization, timestamp alignments, and scheduling. They need no triggers or mock triggers, so those naturally run without proper triggers.\n- Some test define corner conditions around windowing / closing. These are valid even if everything happens in close(), so they are correct as well.\n- Some tests check pure closing behavior (emit trailing data, make sure exceptions are propagated)\n\nI will add another test that checks the correct operation of tumbling window triggers, but aside from that, I think the test coverage is
