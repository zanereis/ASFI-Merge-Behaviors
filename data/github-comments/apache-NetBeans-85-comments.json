What would be missing?\r\n\r\nThe only example where the _aware approach_ of cloning from a singleton has been used I know is `ContextAwareAction`. However, the essential aspect in there is related to _property change listeners and enablement_. `ActionProvider` doesn't work with such concepts.\r\n\r\nOr shall we rather (as a mental experiment) create additional interfaces for `ActionProgressAware` and `ExplicitProcessParametersAware` providers? How would the **composition** of all such interfaces work? I don't have answers to such questions now, but I am scared by the wide range of answers/problems such questions may raise.\r\n\r\nAnother problem of the _aware approach_ is enormous **complications of API** on the side of the caller. Calling into `ActionProvider` becomes complicated. That's probably caused by mixing API and SPI in the `ActionProvider`to begin with, but the need to _clone a copy from a singleton_ before calling makes it even more apparent.\r\n\r\n`invokeAction` with a `Lookup` was enough for passing `ExplicitProcessParameters`. I believe it is going to be enough for passing `ProjectConfiguration` as well. \r\n\r\nPS: Pointing out a use-case which would be significantly in favor _cloning approach_ may of course open my eyes and change my mind.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/841031018/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/841048274","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2954#issuecomment-841048274","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/2954","id":841048274,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0MTA0ODI3NA==","user":{"login":"JaroslavTulach","id":26887752,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODg3NzUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26887752?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach","html_url":"https://github.com/JaroslavTulach","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-14T06:45:46Z","updated_at":"2021-05-14T06:45:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Can we start running the tests on JDK17?

I'll cross-document it in ActionProvider APIs as well so it is easier to find. \r\n\r\nFor the records (persisting the off-PR conversation):\r\n- `ExplicitProcessParameters` is a different beast: the `execution` module does not know Projects, and vice versa. `ActionProvider` implementation in the process does not process that in any way, directly. Only code deeply in the execution infrastructure knows about it. So this is a clear case for Lookup.\r\n- `ActionProgress` is a better example; but unlike active `ProjectConfiguration`, it affects just `invokeAction`, not e.g. `getSupportedActions()`.\r\n- With the presented approach we face higher client costs: the client has to do `instanceof`s, ... - since the client actually uses SPI interface in the current design. If there was an API (delegating to the SPI), or even a helper utility method, the cost would be far less.\r\n- For compatibility (see `ProjectConfigurationProvider` docs), the `ProjectConfiguration` has to be in the Lookup anyway.\r\n\r\nSo as a wrap-up: \r\n- will remove the `ConfigurationAware`\r\n- [Create ProjectActions API](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NETBEANS-5680)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/841148947/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/841692566","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2956#issuecomment-841692566","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/2956","id":841692566,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0MTY5MjU2Ng==","user":{"login":"BradWalker","id":930871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzMDg3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/930871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker","html_url":"https://github.com/BradWalker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-15T16:56:30Z","updated_at":"2021-05-15T16:56:30Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Defective pull request..","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/841692566/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/841693873","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2957#issuecomment-841693873","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/2957","id":841693873,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0MTY5Mzg3Mw==","user":{"login":"BradWalker","id":930871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzMDg3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/930871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker","html_url":"https://github.com/BradWalker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-15T17:04:29Z","updated_at":"2021-05-15T17:04:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Please DO NOT integrate this after approval.

But most of the time this will be filled up by tabs, so the typical appearance of the IDE won't have this problem.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/853095328/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/853700352","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2981#issuecomment-853700352","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/2981","id":853700352,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg1MzcwMDM1Mg==","user":{"login":"sdedic","id":26788611,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg4NjEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26788611?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic","html_url":"https://github.com/sdedic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-03T08:46:42Z","updated_at":"2021-06-03T08:46:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"FWIW, the Darcula L&F has the selection active on the entire line out of the box.

I can test either. Now curious how they implemented full-row selection.\r\n\r\nThe thing with Windows Explorer and other apps that use the full-row behavior, is that the root-level context menu usually just provides shortcuts to actions that are available elsewhere (in the menu bar or in the context menu for individual nodes). So it's just an added convenience for cases where the user has nothing else to click, e.g. before creating a project. But in NetBeans, the \"Projects\" pane has a few actions which I'm not sure can be accessed in other ways, e.g. \"Collapse All\" or the \"View Java Packages As\" option. And if the root context menu has traditionally been easy to access, some people will get used to it over time.\r\n\r\n> Note that there was not an argument about the left-click (selection) behaviour\r\n\r\nOK, so perhaps left-click should still select the whole row. There's also the behavior when dragging and dropping a node on another node.
