Because don't want mac to call the `refresh_allocator_mem` method.\r\n\r\nIt seems that `refresh_proc_meminfo` doesn't call `refresh_allocator_mem` and the implementation of `refresh_allocator_mem` just interacts with `jemalloc` or `tcmalloc` and no platform specific logic is introduced. I don't think we need to introduce a new special definition like `refresh_proc_meminfo`. More special handlings will make the maintenance job more difficult.\r\n\r\nBy the way, the empty definition of `refresh_proc_meminfo` is temporary, we could implement it in the future.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/1320907944/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/1320911152","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/14417#issuecomment-1320911152","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/14417","id":1320911152,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBfSlxs5Ou4Ew","user":{"login":"HappenLee","id":10553413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTUzNDEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10553413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HappenLee","html_url":"https://github.com/HappenLee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HappenLee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HappenLee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HappenLee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HappenLee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HappenLee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HappenLee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HappenLee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HappenLee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HappenLee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-19T15:43:22Z","updated_at":"2022-11-19T15:43:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"why

why the fix just fix the case ?\r\n\r\nI discuss it with @zhangstar333 , this is because currently, we have to make sure that the column type in Doris\r\n is identical to the type in source table, or it will cause BE crash.\r\nIn this case, the `delete` column is with `boolean` type in source table, so the external table in Doris has to be `boolean` too.\r\n\r\n@zhangstar333 will find some other way to prevent BE from crash when type is different, maybe in next PR.\r\nSo I will merge it now to make regression test happy.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/1321154838/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/1321163030","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/14425#issuecomment-1321163030","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/14425","id":1321163030,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBfSlxs5Ov1kW","user":{"login":"ByteYue","id":43750022,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzUwMDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43750022?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ByteYue","html_url":"https://github.com/ByteYue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ByteYue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ByteYue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ByteYue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ByteYue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ByteYue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ByteYue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ByteYue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ByteYue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ByteYue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-20T15:37:43Z","updated_at":"2022-11-20T15:37:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> This PR will print too much logs. If you want to add log to debug temporarily, I suggest to commit in your own repo and test your own branch.\r\n\r\nSorry for so many annoying logs. I do agree it's too many logs and some of them might be redundant. And I do want to seek some help from reviews about which log should be added😂. \r\nI intend to add some useful logs like 1. printing the rows processed by add_batch 2. _pending_batches_bytes when closing the node_channel 3. skipped tablet id when add batch 4. print the afterwards log when it's the last rpc 5. print the logic that has something to do with eos.\r\nThe intention to add these logs is that recently we are encountered with one strange bug that one txn's logs show there were no delta writers for a node channel on one client BE. But it's curious cause when you open one node channel there must be at least one tablet and corresponding delta writer. And the afterwards load channel destructor log even show there is no memory usage indicating there is no write. It's so strange.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/1321163030/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/1321168108","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/14429#issuecomment-1321168108","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/14429","id":1321168108,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBfSlxs5Ov2zs","user":{"login":"hello-stephen","id":27881198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3ODgxMTk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27881198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hello-stephen","html_url":"https://github.com/hello-stephen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hello-stephen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hello-stephen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hello-stephen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hello-stephen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hello-stephen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hello-stephen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hello-stephen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hello-stephen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hello-stephen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-20T16:02:06Z","updated_at":"2022-11-20T16:12:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"TeamCity

Hi, this PR is try to fix a problem in audit with multiple statements. however, u change the parser of nereids, the new optimizer of Doris. so u use 1.1.2 with Nereids switch on and found this

has no relevance with Nereids, it is not a parse problem, the key is the behavior is not right when handling multiple statements and sending statements to audit queue, DorisSqlSeparator.g4 is used for spliting multiple statements to multi lines and sending these lines one by one)**.  Maybe i need to recurrence this problem by using master branch.
