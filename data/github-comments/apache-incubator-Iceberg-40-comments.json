I'll merge this to unblock next steps.\r\n> \r\n> Where does this fit in the overall plan for Hive support? \r\n\r\nWell, this is actually a good milestone as we now have everything that's needed to be able to _read_ Iceberg tables from Hive merged into master. \r\n\r\nUp next we were going to add back in the features like pushdowns, system tables, time travel reads etc. but they're all improvements, what is in Iceberg now should work end to end for the read path. One thing I'd like to change to make this easier to use is for the module to build an uber jar so you only have to add one jar to Hive's classpath instead of 6+ which is the case at the moment. Once that's done we also need to add documentation describing this all.\r\n\r\n> Are tests going to be added next? What works right now and what doesn't?\r\n\r\n@guilload ended up adding the tests in #1192 - the main test class is [TestHiveIcebergInputFormat](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/master/mr/src/test/java/org/apache/iceberg/mr/hive/TestHiveIcebergInputFormat.java).
