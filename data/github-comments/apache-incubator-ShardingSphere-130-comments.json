I hesitate to respond or not at first glance, since maybe It is no meaning to discuss why people have to talk with others in English in an Apache project community (**Apache ShardingSphere must conform to the regulation of Apache, speaking in English is included**).\r\n\r\nSecondly, **English is a universal language**, only in which people all over the world could learn more about Apache ShardingSphere better.\r\n\r\nThirdly, I am sorry for the changed APIs among different release versions, which I know is not friendly for users to upgrade. But **the purpose that the whole community works hard is to** provide a better, stable, and foresighted product. Frankly speaking, ShardingSphere is not so perfect since it is underway. But that is exactly what we are working on, i.e., **The API of 5.x release will settle down and provide a much simpler configuration for our community**.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, I can't entirely agree with your opinion. Apache ShardingSphere is open source and free for everyone. **You do need to pay nothing to use it, why do you only judge it? If you think it not so good, why do not you join this community to improve it and make it become what you want it to be?** You know it is also a chance to start your open source journey, and others could benefit from what you did as well!\r\n\r\nIf one person wants to become professional and influential(Maybe), or just out of his or her interests, it is a great way to join an open-source community and try to make some contributions. I believe.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nTrista","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/641703754/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/641704507","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/5892#issuecomment-641704507","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/5892","id":641704507,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MTcwNDUwNw==","user":{"login":"terrymanu","id":5516298,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTYyOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5516298?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu","html_url":"https://github.com/terrymanu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-10T03:54:02Z","updated_at":"2020-06-10T03:54:11Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"subquery
