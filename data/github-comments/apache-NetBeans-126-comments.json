Aren't you looking for the outgoing variants by chance? Do a gradlew oV in your project and see the output.\r\n> […](#)\r\n\r\nThe PR targets two things. First, the ability to find out product(s) of the project. Outgoing variants could be useful, but on the sample project (micronaut project, that includes native-image build plugin), the `gradlew oV` output does not contain an information that such thing is produced:\r\n```\r\nsdedic@sdedic-nb4:oci/microdemo5$ gradle oV  | grep build/\r\nPicked up _JAVA_OPTIONS: -Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=on -Dswing.aatext=true\r\n    - build/libs/microdemo-0.1.jar (artifactType = jar)\r\n    - build/libs/microdemo-0.1.jar (artifactType = jar)\r\n          - build/classes/java/main (artifactType = java-classes-directory)\r\n          - build/resources/main (artifactType = java-resources-directory)\r\n    - build/libs/microdemo-0.1-all.jar (artifactType = jar)\r\n    - build/libs/microdemo-0.1-all.jar (artifactType = jar)\r\n    - build/test-results/test/binary (artifactType = directory)\r\n```\r\nThere's no `build/native/nativeCompile/microdemo` in the output, althought the plugin is configured. That's natural, since it shows variant products for individual consumable configurations -- the `native-image` plugin does not create any specific configuration (maybe a deficiency ? especially in the .dll/.so scenario it could be).\r\nBut as I see the output, it seems that the implementation of the project artifact query could be greatly improved following the OutgoingVariants report implementation - a theme for another PR!\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1233874554/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1233885171","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/4575#issuecomment-1233885171","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4575","id":1233885171,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5Ji5fz","user":{"login":"Chris2011","id":795658,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NTY1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/795658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011","html_url":"https://github.com/Chris2011","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-01T07:49:48Z","updated_at":"2022-09-01T07:49:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The JS parser should be up to date with latest NetBeans 14 thanks to @matthiasblaesing .

I agree that instantiating tasks (= user code) could be dangerous. \r\n\r\nIt seems that instantiation happens every time, just because we're **enumerating tasks** from the buildscript, so we can (for example) present them, for example, in the `Navigator` window for a gradle project.\r\nNot only Jar task, which will be eventually executed as the part of buildscript, but all of them - e.g. `OutgoingVariantsReportTask` (`./gradlew oV`) is instantiated.\r\n\r\nSo, if the concern that task creation is harmful is valid and important, we should remove the task listing code and corresponding feature(s) in the IDE (or implement them using another technique).

I would not go that way: it might be bad (this is why we have 'Do you trust the build script' question, among other reasons)  ... but seems acceptable.\r\n\r\nIf there Tasks already instantiate ... why don't exploit the data then, so the IDE can evaluate using the most accurate values ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1234236277/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1234241761","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/4265#issuecomment-1234241761","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4265","id":1234241761,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5JkQjh","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-01T12:55:57Z","updated_at":"2022-09-01T12:55:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"please make sure the commit has a useful message prior to merge.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1234241761/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1234381493","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/4274#issuecomment-1234381493","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4274","id":1234381493,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5Jkyq1","user":{"login":"timboudreau","id":1901175,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDExNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1901175?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timboudreau","html_url":"https://github.com/timboudreau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timboudreau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timboudreau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timboudreau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timboudreau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timboudreau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timboudreau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timboudreau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timboudreau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timboudreau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-01T14:43:44Z","updated_at":"2022-09-01T14:43:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yeah, since I now have one big tree of non-modular libraries with `Automatic-Module-Name`, and for work am working on another big tree of modular libraries that depend on the non-modular ones (which are public and still JDK-8 compatible and broader in scope), I now have **two userdirs and two cache dirs**, one for working on modular projects and one for working on non-modular ones.\r\n\r\nAnd if I ever forget and open one of the non-modular projects, I have to go edit a `.properties` in my userdir.

And why I disagree with @matthiasblaesing that this is \"philosophical\" and doesn't belong in the review.  Where else do we review usability?!\r\n\r\n> using an explicit type for a var instead of an inline hint works only in code where one can write the explicit type. It does not work for reading existing code written by someone else, for example.\r\n\r\nFirstly there may be a point to having different inline hint defaults in editable vs non-editable code.  Not that that covers all bases.\r\n\r\nSecondly, could this particular hint be moved to the end of the line?  Similar to #2365 (and the still open #2785).  Direct use of `var` doesn't seem that important compared to assignment by method call?  ie. hints to the return type from methods in assignments (where the assignment is `var` _or_ an explicit supertype) might be more useful?  And putting it to the right hand side covers some of my concerns about how these influence formatting and written code.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1235532071/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1235631274","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/3962#issuecomment-1235631274","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/3962","id":1235631274,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5Jpjyq","user":{"login":"NicolaIsotta","id":18428155,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI4MTU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18428155?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicolaIsotta","html_url":"https://github.com/NicolaIsotta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicolaIsotta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicolaIsotta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicolaIsotta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicolaIsotta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicolaIsotta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicolaIsotta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicolaIsotta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicolaIsotta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicolaIsotta/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-02T15:24:53Z","updated_at":"2022-09-02T15:24:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Testing the command line option with Netbeans 14 on Windows 11 and Java 11\r\nThe issue persists","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1235631274/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1235650882","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/3962#issuecomment-1235650882","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/3962","id":1235650882,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5JpolC","user":{"login":"neilcsmith-net","id":3975960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3975960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net","html_url":"https://github.com/neilcsmith-net","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-02T15:43:42Z","updated_at":"2022-09-02T15:43:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks @NicolaIsotta Could you also try with `-J-DTopSecurityManager.disable=true`.\r\n\r\nWhen you say it persists, is it immediate, or does it happen after some time?
