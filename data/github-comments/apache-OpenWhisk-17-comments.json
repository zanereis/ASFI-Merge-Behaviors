Both CF and Bluemix name their CLI binary downloads with additional identification labeling.  Such as `Bluemix_CLI_0.3.3_amd64`, `cf-cli_6.19.0_winx64.zip`, `cf-cli_6.19.0_linux_i686.tgz`\n\nProbably something for us to consider.  We can handle the platform/architecture bits right now (if agreed), but will need some OpenWhisk wide version value (may be there and I just don't know about it) to add the version number.\n\n/cc @csantanapr @houshengbo \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/226569863/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/226570564","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/675#issuecomment-226570564","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/675","id":226570564,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNjU3MDU2NA==","user":{"login":"mdeuser","id":18535381,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTM1Mzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18535381?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser","html_url":"https://github.com/mdeuser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-16T18:23:20Z","updated_at":"2016-06-16T18:23:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@dubeejw - I did try to compress within Docker (no ansible), but the zip command was not available in the docker image, so I had to move the compression into the build scripts.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/226570564/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/226575764","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/675#issuecomment-226575764","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/675","id":226575764,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNjU3NTc2NA==","user":{"login":"dubee","id":11520887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIwODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11520887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee","html_url":"https://github.com/dubee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-16T18:41:27Z","updated_at":"2016-06-16T18:41:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@mdeuser, I see now.
