That will reduce memory pressure.\r\n> \r\n> If you truly want the server to run with each TaskManager, I think we can do what you are trying to do here, but lets add a flag, that controls the reuse behavior and turn it on only for Flink path? I do think this will also involve testing of the incremental sync part more rigorously. Without the incremental sync, I think we end up calling AbstractTableFileSystemView#runSync(), which will reset and reinit file listings anyway, by refreshing the timeline (causes more listings to .hoodie/ each call to timeline server to check if local view is behind, see RequestHandler#syncIfLocalViewBehind)\r\n> \r\n> Hope that helps!\r\n\r\nThanks so much for the feedback, add the config option is reasonable for me, adding the timeline service to `JobManager` is not a good choice because in Flink, it is hard to do RPC between `TaskManager` and `JobManager`, the logic in `JobManager` should be lightweight and clean.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/838074201/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/838077879","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/2012#issuecomment-838077879","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/2012","id":838077879,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzODA3Nzg3OQ==","user":{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-11T08:36:38Z","updated_at":"2021-05-11T08:36:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@n3nash `BaseAvroPayloadWithSchema` is this still needed, which keeps the schema in each record?

I see some of you guys already worked on some type of fix/workaround. How would you advise dealing with this? \r\n\r\nI tried to add `\"hoodie.datasource.hive_sync.support_timestamp\", true` as an option but it does not look like it's working.\r\n\r\nAlso, I've seen multiple Github issues raised about this issue, and in most of them there's a link to @li36909's [comment above](https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/2544#issuecomment-815849870) as a workaround. Unfortunately, as mentioned by @cdmikechen \"`TimestampWritableV2` is a hive3 class\", and unfortunately we are also relying on Hive2.\r\n\r\nIs there a workaround for Hive2?

A follow up on the incremental pull, how does Hudi keep track of which records were changed and which ones were inserted and deleted from a particular checkpoint among others. Does Hudi maintain the state of each record from previous commits even in the latest snapshot (which I thought was the sole purpose of the file versions). I guess what I am trying to get my head around is how Hudi fetches changes (updates, inserts and deletes) from a particular commit X to the latest snapshot when all the states (file versions?) from X to the current are no longer around. \r\n\r\nA follow up on hoodie.cleaner.fileversions.retained, how is this setting different from hoodie.cleaner.commits.retained?
