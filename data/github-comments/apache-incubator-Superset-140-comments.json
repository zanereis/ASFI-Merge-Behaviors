I tracked it down to `process_data` in `viz.py`\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/caa72675a5b69e0ba133a3e652e1f807e0163d9c/superset/viz.py#L1104-L1107, where `fd.get('groupby')` are uppercase, but the corresponding Series in `df` are lowercase. I was also able to confirm that the @jhettler hack works in my case. A simple fix in this case would be to lowercase the `groupby` columns, but not sure if that is ok under all circumstances.

I'm on version v0.24.0. For some reason, the filter is not being applied correctly. I looked at the query that is generated and the lookup is passed and the filter is also applied in the query.  This makes me think it is something on the druid end or how exactly the query is formed.  \r\nPossible solutions in fixing the query building piece:\r\n- Add an extractionFn to the selector filter which repeats the map from the list of dimensions. http://druid.io/docs/latest/querying/filters.html#filtering-with-extraction-functions\r\n\r\n- Use a having filter instead which will apply the filter after the grouping.\r\n\r\nThe former is slightly more performant.

would not pursue this, [from Dan Abranov ](\r\nhttps://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/75938353012011008) (on React team, creator of redux):\r\n\r\n> Don‘t use PureComponent everywhere. Measure.\r\n\r\nOn that Twitter thread he notes that equality checks for every `prop` for every component (which is what happens when you use `PureComponent`) is not necessarily cheap, and it can actually slow down your app in some cases.\r\n\r\nThis is what I've been told as well, you should only start doing this when you measure something (with dev tools) and know something expensive is happening. Or do some explicit measuring in this PR and only update significant improvements you see.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4496521/39463701-2db7b4f2-4cce-11e8-80e6-f6b784dddac0.png\" width=\"400\" />","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/385608926/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/385609581","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/4913#issuecomment-385609581","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/4913","id":385609581,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NTYwOTU4MQ==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-01T06:34:47Z","updated_at":"2018-05-01T06:34:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/4913?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#4913](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/4913?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/commit/e1d2150391ba827a64cebd0c0573aab0a82a3634?src=pr&el=desc) will **not change** coverage.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/4913/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&height=150&src=pr&token=KsB0fHcx6l)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/4913?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@           Coverage Diff           @@\n##           master    #4913   +/-   ##\n=======================================\n  Coverage   77.14%   77.14%           \n=======================================\n  Files          44       44           \n  Lines        8539     8539           \n=======================================\n  Hits         6587     6587           \n  Misses       1952     1952\n```\n\n\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/4913?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/4913?src=pr&el=footer).

@darylerwin @mistercrunch @mxmzdlv @Bamieh \r\nThanks to you guys (your guidance) I was finally able to connect my superset to bigquery in windows.\r\nFor some reason I was not able to set env

though.\r\n\r\n@Bamieh Idid not try using docker for running this. I have only heard about docker. Have never practically used it or worked with it. It would be great if you could point me to some resources on it so that I can learn the same.\r\n\r\nNow I can see tables and get their count and other things.
