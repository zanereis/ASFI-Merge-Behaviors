I hava met the same situation.\r\nWhen I use a single thread to perform paging queries,  the result of each query is correct.\r\nBut then I use a threadpool to excute  the same queries(Every 'Logic SQL' is as same as above),  I found repeated results of  different threads, or sometimes the result size of some threads is not correct.\r\n\r\n**Which version of ShardingSphere did you use?**\r\n3.1.0 &  4.0.0-RC1-SNAPSHOT\r\n\r\n**Which project did you use? Sharding-JDBC or Sharding-Proxy?**\r\nSharding-JDBC\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nPaging query gets the correct result when single or multi-threaded\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior**\r\nPaging query performance is random when multi-threaded\r\n\r\n**Reason analyze (If you can)**\r\nI found through debugging that the offset after rewrite in each thread is correct, but when the resultsets are merged, skipOff() gets the wrong limit object(in LimitDecoratorMergedResult.java). \r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the behavior, such as: SQL to execute, sharding rule configuration, when exception occur etc.**\r\n1.  There are 2 datasources in my test environment, and the sharding rule is: \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5668787/55371781-090bba00-5532-11e9-8643-35bc3f0843b1.png)\r\n2.  The original SQL is: \r\n 'SELECT l.id from tb_loan l where l.status in( ?,  ?)  and l.ACCOUNT_DATE < ? order by l.id\r\n    limit ? , ?; '    \r\n  the parameters are same except limit value;\r\n  ###  (the l.id is PRIMARY KEY and is Globally unique)\r\n3.  Create a threadpool and put some threads to excute query, the limit value of thread-1 is '0, 2'', of thread-2 is '2,2', and so on;   \r\n4.  In my test case, there are 15 records in ds_1 and 11 records in ds_2, so there are 13 pages need to be query;\r\n5.  Log the limit value in LimitDecoratorMergedResult,  we can find the same offset of different thread. \r\n6.  But now in ShardingPreparedStatement#getResultSet() method,  the value of ((SelectStatement) routeResult.getSqlStatement()).getLimit().getOffsetValue()  is as expected and has no repeated data.\r\n\r\nThanks to the work done by the open source team,  hope you can fix it. 💯
