I also have a `KeyValueStore` implementation that maintains an in-memory, limited-size LRU cache (e.g., `InMemoryLRUCacheStore`) of recently used entries. Sometimes a processor wants to track up to _n_ recently-used items, and this is a convenient way to do this. I'm willing to contribute it via a new pull request if you are interested.\n\nIt does need a few enhancements to `MeteredKeyValueStore` to better support entries being \"automatically\" removed by the 'inner' store. \n\nBut a larger problem is that `MeteredKeyValueStore` currently assumes it can get the key and value serializers and deserializers from the context. IIUC this is not always valid since those are merely the _default_ key and value serializers and deserializers. For example, I might have a topology that uses multiple processors with different key and value types, in which case the context's default (de)serializers will be valid for only one of the processors. Or, I might have a single processor that uses a key value store with different key and value types than the processor. So this seems like an invalid assumption that needs to be fixed.\n\nIf you agree that the latter is a problem, I'd be happy to create a PR to address it. If you're interested in the `InMemoryLRUCacheStore` class, that could be a separate PR.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/142719926/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/142722217","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/234#issuecomment-142722217","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/234","id":142722217,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MjcyMjIxNw==","user":{"login":"granders","id":1295932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTU5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1295932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/granders","html_url":"https://github.com/granders","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granders/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granders/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granders/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granders/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granders/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granders/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granders/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granders/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granders/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-23T20:41:25Z","updated_at":"2015-09-23T20:41:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@SinghAsDev

I will need to change both UnknownConsumerException and IllegalGenerationIdException to Non-retriable.\n\nThere are two scenarios:\n1. A consumer that has been kicked out of the group wants to commit offsets. In this case, we should throw exception rather than retry.\n2. A coordinator failover happened (in the current checked in code it is as if all the consumers are kicked out of the group), we need to retry.\n\nToday a consumer is not able to distinguish between those two scenarios. But I think moving forward, we should persist the group metadata for coordinator failover. The coordinator failover should either throw a GroupMetadataLoadingInProgressException or hold the offset commit request until the failover finish.\n\nIf we follow that path then making UnknownConsumerIdException and IllegalGenerationIdException non-retriable is reasonable. Today, making both of them non retriable means that we expose the coordinator failover to the users in (2), so user needs rejoin the group and retry commit with correct offset. It is a little bit ugly but not too big a deal.

That's a good point about the coordinator failure case. Unless we have persistence, the new coordinator will have no choice but to reject the commits, and the only thing the client can do is propagate the error to the user. This pretty much guarantees that broker failures (or even clean broker shutdowns) will generally lead to duplicate consumption, which is unfortunate. Do you guys think this problem is serious enough to push for persistence in the initial release? Either way, it seems like making IllegalGeneration and UnknownConsumer non-retriable is the right thing to do since rebalancing in commit is not really an option.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/142980291/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/142983911","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/237#issuecomment-142983911","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/237","id":142983911,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0Mjk4MzkxMQ==","user":{"login":"gwenshap","id":1189030,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODkwMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1189030?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap","html_url":"https://github.com/gwenshap","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-24T16:45:13Z","updated_at":"2015-09-24T16:45:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Changes
