I see a lot of the increase comes from moving some of the other replication APIs (\"list files\", \"get index version\") from core over to the \"api\" module -- I've actually got another PR that takes a stab at some of those changes as well, so if we rebase one on top of the other, that should shrink this PR back down a good bit.  Will take a crack at that shortly, and check back in when that's done!\r\n\r\nVery curious about the \"StreamingOutput\" type you found.  I've used `InputStream` in a few similar cases with other APIs (e.g. there's a \"filestore\" API that returns raw files, similar to this /replication one), though maybe StreamingOutput is better?

that sounds good, as I feel we might be trying to expand the scope of this change too much for 1 PR. I agree, making the public modifiers change is needed, then we can document how to do a typical simple use-case of a custom aggregate in plugin code using only String values from json. That's enough for this PR. I'll work on that next, although I don't know much about the RefGuide as I've not written for it before, will look.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, next steps of work for another PR would be to add another method to ValueSourceParser and call it from FacetParser, so we fully support parent facets and non-String complex json config. I can produce a 2nd PR with my proposed diff for that change.\r\n\r\nAnd further steps are your Plan B, with complete ability to override or replace the FacetModule mechanism, and define new kinds of

done another round of thinking, polishing and experimenting, my comments follow on the various open topics:\r\n### Tests\r\nI spent a good 2-3 hours trying to refactor the tests from the current RestTestBase to SolrJettyTestRule.\r\nIt proved less intuitive than expected, didn't manage to finish, still a lot of errors, bits of code that were handy in RestTestBase and had to be duplicated, and I couldn't foresee any particular improvement in readability or other benefits.\r\nSo is this a route we really need to adhere to?\r\nCurrent tests seem decently readable, with a good coverage and easy to extend.\r\nLooking around I couldn't find a uniform landscape, different modules use different tests style, so If it's about consistency and we care in uniforming this, maybe it's worth doing in a separate issue and by someone with enough knowledge and focus to do this in a decent timeframe?\r\nOn the other hand if there are real blockers/wrongdoing with the current tests I am more than happy to fix them.\r\n\r\n### FileStore vs ManagedResource\r\nCurrent Requirement:\r\nA model is a simple tiny Json that contains the parameter to connect to an embedding service.\r\nDiscussion:\r\nSpent some time offline with David around this topic and it seems using the FileStore could be an overkill for this requirement.\r\nI then explored configSets in Solr and how we manage them, including managedResources.\r\nIn the end, I returned to square 1:\r\nthe current EmbeddingModelStore is a ManagedResource that supports persistency.\r\nThe code seems simple and readable enough.\r\nSo, do we really need to replace it with something else?\r\nAnd in case, what do you think we should replace it with?\r\nLet me know your thoughts, and thanks again for the help so far!\r\nI believe we are making progress!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2471257341/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2472188518","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2809#issuecomment-2472188518","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2809","id":2472188518,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6TWppm","user":{"login":"dsmiley","id":377295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzI5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/377295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley","html_url":"https://github.com/dsmiley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-13T02:07:34Z","updated_at":"2024-11-13T02:07:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks

To summarize: StreamingOutput is easier for various JAX-RS supported interceptor hooks (MessageBodyWriter, ResponseFilter, etc.).  The example given is an interceptor that implements gzip-encoding - apparently that's tough to do on an OutputStream, but easier in some way for JAX-RS to handle when wrapped as a 'StreamingOutput'.\r\n\r\nThat said - supporting this type in our Java code-generation might take a bit more effort than we want to bite off here and now.  The API should be fine as far as Javascript and Python clients are concerned, but the custom template we're using for Java makes that one a bit trickier.\r\n\r\nI'll exempt `fetchFile` from Java code generation (we have an annotation for that purpose), and create a followup JIRA ticket around standardizing on and supporting StreamingOutput.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2476943623/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2477285696","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2742#issuecomment-2477285696","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2742","id":2477285696,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6TqGFA","user":{"login":"mkhludnev","id":807522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/807522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkhludnev","html_url":"https://github.com/mkhludnev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkhludnev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkhludnev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkhludnev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkhludnev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkhludnev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkhludnev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkhludnev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkhludnev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkhludnev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-14T19:51:56Z","updated_at":"2024-11-14T19:51:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> you can already achieve the desired results using the existing mechanism `type:func`\r\n\r\nWait a sec.

If you're speaking about the documentation such as README file then I will add one how to start local environment, until we'll have complete integration with backend solution, it won't help.

I believe the module's / angular project's README file is the best place to tell other developers how to get started with this sub-project.

The environment files under `/src/environments` are missing and causing an error when launching the app with `ng serve`.\r\n\r\nAnd one last tip, it's fine and also recommended to include `package-lock.json` in the VCS, as it ensures reproducable states of the project. :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2480897920/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2480968084","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2856#issuecomment-2480968084","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2856","id":2480968084,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6T4JGU","user":{"login":"dsmiley","id":377295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzI5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/377295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley","html_url":"https://github.com/dsmiley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-17T07:01:12Z","updated_at":"2024-11-17T07:01:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"If I should break this up, or file another JIRA, let me know.

There are two issues in the referencing, one the libs.langchain4j and the other one was `libs.apache.solr.testframework`.\r\n\r\nThe first one is actually a tricky one and I will have to provide a note in the documentation in case this happens again. When you have in `libs.versions.toml` `langchain4j` and `langchain4j-cohere` (for example), then you have to reference the first dependency as `libs.langchain4j.asProvider()`, otherwise it is just a group of dependencies, not the dependency itself. An alternative solution in this case is to simply add another keyword and extend `langchain4j` in `libs.version.toml`, like I did. Usually for \"core\" libraries that have simple names like in this case, you can use `core` or the module name itself (`langchain4j-langchain4j`).\r\n\r\nThe second dependency `libs.apache.solr.testframework` could not be resolved, either because you mean `libs.apache.lucene.testframework` or `project(':solr:test-framework')`. I assumed the second one, but if wrong, please update it.\r\n\r\nIf you update the permissions of this PR, I can push these changes together with a cleanup of the newly added license files (there is another issue there) and and update locks /

If you search our ref guide for \"Kerberos\", it still exists in this PR. See `authentication-and-authorization-plugins.adoc`.\r\n\r\n@dsmiley  I wanted to follow up on this.  Is it possible that Kerberos still exists without Hadoop Auth?   I assumed Hadoop Auth was different thatn Kerberos, in that with Kerberos you could authenticate in a Kerberos environment, and that didn't require Hadoop Auth..   That Hadoop Auth was a place to validate kerberous credentials, but you might validate elsewhere?   There do seem to be lots of references to Kerberos that aren't tied to Hadoop Auth..   I think I need some guidence on where to go...   Should I just remove the rest of the Kerberos code?    cc @janhoy  @risdenk  as well for visibility...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2488589191/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2488602738","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2876#issuecomment-2488602738","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2876","id":2488602738,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6UVRBy","user":{"login":"risdenk","id":3384157,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzODQxNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3384157?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk","html_url":"https://github.com/risdenk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-20T13:33:48Z","updated_at":"2024-11-20T13:33:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"s3mock was a problem when I last looked at Jetty 11/12 due to it needing to stay on 2.x due to Java 17 required in 3.x.
