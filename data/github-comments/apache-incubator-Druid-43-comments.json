reproduced this in test.\n\nThe issue only occurs if the duplicate dimension has never been seen before.\n\nEach time an InputRow is added we initialize a 2D array (1 cell in top level for each dimension, with an array containing the unique values for this dimension) with size = the # of dimensions seen so far.\nWe then loop through the dimensions, updating the 2d array (or an overflow buffer) with the values for each dimension.\n\nWe will see the duplicate dimension twice in this update loop. On the second time, we will find an index for this dimension (set the first time), and attempt to set the new set of values for this dimension to this index in the 2D array.  However, this array was initialized based on the number of dimensions seen as of the last call to add (which is 1 too small, since we've never seen this dimension before), and we hit index out of bounds.\n\nIn the case that the duplicate dimension had been seen before (in a previous call to add), the 2D array will already be properly sized.  We will find an index for the duplicate dimension both times we see it in the update loop, and set it to the same set of values in the 2D array.\n\nIt seems to me like duplicate dimensions should be an error, but I would like to clarify what the expected behavior is in this case.\n\n80d8eedcf7422479020fa9388cd66f55dc74230d\nthis commit illustrates the second condition (the duplicate dimension has been seen before, and the add has no issue). By commenting out the first call to add, you can see it fail when it attempts to access the 2D array.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/158743408/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/158854773","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1728#issuecomment-158854773","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1728","id":158854773,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1ODg1NDc3Mw==","user":{"login":"himanshug","id":246308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjMwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug","html_url":"https://github.com/himanshug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-23T05:10:51Z","updated_at":"2015-11-23T05:10:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@gianm addressed comments\nalso, changed getMergingFactory() default implementation to just throw unsupported op exception.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/158854773/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/159000327","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1999#issuecomment-159000327","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1999","id":159000327,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1OTAwMDMyNw==","user":{"login":"xvrl","id":815147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNTE0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/815147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl","html_url":"https://github.com/xvrl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-23T17:17:17Z","updated_at":"2015-11-23T17:17:17Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Have we officially deprecated them in the docs?

assuming it is aggreed that this case is an error I see two approaches.\n\n1) eliminate the possibility of duplicates by having the InputRow return a Set instead of a List (implications on dimension ordering)\n\n2) on each call to add, maintain a set of the dimensions seen in this input row, throwing a descriptive error on duplicate dimensions. \n\nThe existing lookup (does this dimension have an index) can be used to detect duplicates on the first occurance of the dimension (i.e. Found an index but array is too small, turning what is now an index out of bounds into something more descriptive), however it is not sufficient to detect duplicate dimensions if this dimension was seen on a previous row (the index will be found and the array sufficiently large).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/159781903/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/159972979","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/2007#issuecomment-159972979","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2007","id":159972979,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1OTk3Mjk3OQ==","user":{"login":"nishantmonu51","id":5023786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjM3ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5023786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51","html_url":"https://github.com/nishantmonu51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-26T18:26:15Z","updated_at":"2015-11-26T18:26:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"closing
