other points\r\n\r\n1. We should upload some pre-tuned parameters for resnet and delete the old records in x86/conv2d.py\r\n\r\n2. In terms of graph level tuner. We should think about the formalization introduced by the paper we discussed in  #1585 .\r\nCurrently we have different implementations for x86 cpu and arm cpu. Specifically, we have spatial pack, NCHWc_common, NCHWc_1x1 and winograd. On both x86 and arm, each of them has the chance to be the best for some input shapes. So the optimal solution is to merge the templates for x86 and arm cpu, and let the graph tuner choose them by considering both kernel time and layout transform time.\r\nYour current graph tuner only supports NCHWc template. Do you think it is easy to generalize it to support arbitrary templates? I think this can improve the performance a lot at least on arm cpu. And the framework will be quite generalizable since we can add many templates and let the graph tuner make the final optimal solution.

The key point is to define how to generate layout transformation given a schedule template. For now I just add built-in layout transform generator for NCHWc, but it is not hard to add support for other formats.\r\n\r\nI agree that we should finally tune different algorithms, The key part is still managing possible layout transforms between given schedules, which might come from different algorithms.\r\n\r\nIn terms of problem formulation, I would like to treat it more related to solver. For PBQP solver, we may want to formulate it as graph and cost matrices. For DP or RL methods, it might be more suitable to use states/actions representation. Current design is base class converts records from autotvm and manages fundamental data structure. In specific solver, these data structures are used to formulate the problem in a way suitable for this solver. What do you think about this way? In current graph tuner implementation, there is some information specific to DP solver in base class.

But just think a second PR is necessary to sort that out.\r\n\r\nMy main point is to introduce a fresh incomplete type ```?T``` for handling composite incomplete types like```Tuple(?A, ? B)``` . With the following reasons:\r\n\r\n- The current algorithm tries to implement a fast version of inference that does lazy triggers of the active relations in the bipartite graph\r\n- Specifically, when a Type get updated by the solver, all the unsolved relations that refer to the Type will get triggered.\r\n- However, to make sure such relation propagates nicely, we will need to allocate a node for each type that is incomplete, say a relation which relies on a Tuple(?A, ? B), which is compositional. If there is no node in the bipartite graph to represent this type, then the triggering is flawed.\r\n   - Conceptually, when a composite type contains incomplete holes, we can also view it as a constraint between ?T and ?A, ?B if we generate a fresh ```?T```, and the relation is ```MakeTupleRelation(?A, ?B, ?T)```\r\n- The main concern I have is when the inference gets ties into symbolic integers, in this case, actually, the symbolic integer itself can be incomplete, which means TensorType is a composite type instead of a primitive one, having a strict rule such that incomplete type composition is always represented by relation might help mitigate this issue.\r\n\r\nGiven these thoughts, I feel it is better to bring a second PR to solve these issues. Note that the original way of treating incomplete composite type solves the issue of composite tuples but not the symbolic integer case. I hope we can check in things that are clean, limited but known to work on limited cases, then improve them to cover a broader set of things that we care about.\r\n\r\n### Example to Illustrate the problem.\r\nImagine we have relation\r\n```\r\n- R1(1, ?B)\r\n- R2(?B, ?E)\r\n- R3(Tuple(?B, ?E), ?C)\r\n```\r\nWhen we call R1 to update ?B into a concrete type, R2 will be triggered, because ```?B``` have maintains a list of pending relations on it which includes R2. It is harder to tell whether we should trigger R3(we need to maintain the reverse depending by unpacking the tuple recursively), because although B is concrete, E is still not solved.\r\n\r\nA better way would be storing things as(which I am arguing for)\r\n```\r\n- R1(1, ?B)\r\n- R2(?B, ?E)\r\n- MakeTupleRelation(?B, ?E, ?T)\r\n- R3(?T, ?C)\r\n```\r\nIn this case, E will R1 will trigger MakeTupleRelation, which will fail, then once ?E get updated, it will trigger MakeTupleRelation again. Or we can enhance the solver to be aware of that any only trigger when things are concrete.\r\n\r\nThe potential drawback of introducing intermediate type though is that when we are trying to unify two tuple types, they don't necessarily propagate to the relation in the child. For example \r\n```\r\nTuple(?A, 1) == Tuple(2, ?B)\r\n```\r\nwill reduce to ```?A == 2 and ?B == 1```, but if they are expanded as relations, it becomes\r\n```\r\n- ?T1 == ?T2\r\n- MakeTupleRelation(?A, 1, T1)\r\n- MakeTupleRelation(2, ?B, T2)\r\n```\r\nSpecial rules are necessary to detect duplicated MakeTupleRelation in this case and propagates the constraints to the child equivalence (?A == 2) and (?B == 1).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/425283500/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/425283909","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/1780#issuecomment-425283909","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1780","id":425283909,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNTI4MzkwOQ==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-28T00:34:41Z","updated_at":"2018-09-28T00:34:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The index here is not really array index, but index within a computational graph.

The graph itself is not a graph for the exactly the same reason that it is already CSed as user constructs them.\r\n\r\ni.e. if a user constructs the program via DSL(i.e. IRBuilder), she might write\r\n```python\r\nx = some relay_expr\r\ny = relay.op.add(x, 1)\r\nlet z = relay.op.add(y, y)\r\n```\r\nIf we simply print out the expression as they are, it will explode as a tree\r\n```\r\nlet %z = add(add(%x, 1), add(%x, 1))\r\n``` \r\nThe information that the intermediate value is CSEd is missing here, instead, a better way would be \r\n```\r\n%1 = add(%x, 1)\r\nlet %z = add(%1, %1)\r\n``` \r\n\r\nI understand this is normally not considered as good pratice for normal programs, but this makes sense for deep learning workloads, where each operations can be arbitrarily nested.\r\n\r\nMost users still think in terms of computational graphs, and it is important for us to support that concept well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/425503611/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/425596076","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/1770#issuecomment-425596076","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1770","id":425596076,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNTU5NjA3Ng==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-28T23:50:58Z","updated_at":"2018-09-28T23:50:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks

I have gone through the code. The key challenge here as raised in the #1756 is that certain part of code will require platform dependent API, specifically:\r\n\r\n## API specificity\r\n\r\n- Fork system call\r\n   - Only supported in linux, there is windows equivalent, not supported by andoir\r\n- filesys dir query\r\n   - Current implementation linux only, it is possible to get a windows/linux compatible version\r\n- socket related things\r\n   - select API is relatively linux, however, we can port a windows/linux compatible select from https://github.com/dmlc/rabit/blob/master/src/socket.h#L423\r\n\r\n## Where to put the code\r\nThe general principle is everything under src/runtime need to be stable and works on all systems, the ```apps/cpp_rpc``` would be more relaxed, and make use of APIs like fork.\r\n\r\nGiven the current status of the code, I would recommend to encapsulate the RPCServer as a class and put most of the listen, accept and filesystem logic into ```apps/cpp_rpc``` first.  Ideally, I would  recommend to make it windows and linux compatible, but this is not a must as python version of rpc server can still be used.\r\n\r\nThere are still value to put certain code into src/runtime/rpc, specifically the tracker reporting logic, if we can encapsulate that as a class e.g. (TrackerClient) and encapsulate certain reporting feature there, we could put some of the tracker related logic into there.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/425678296/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/425678516","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/1731#issuecomment-425678516","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1731","id":425678516,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNTY3ODUxNg==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-29T22:05:24Z","updated_at":"2018-09-29T22:05:24Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks
