Therefore I assume a lot of people have installed it. I assume that with your m2e additions both the m2e connector as well as the bundle-plugins m2e lifecycle management will kick in. But I am not too sure about that either, therefore I asked the question on the m2e-users mailing list (http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/m2e-users/msg05444.html)\n\n>  some ideas to improve this:\n> -     in case of incremental build detect which files changed since last build and trigger manifest generation only if the changeset includes a file with SCR annotations.\n\nActually the manifest will not only change in that case, but also if a new package has been added which does not have \"impl\" in its name (because it will be automatically exported). Another use case is that the version annotation on the package has been changed (this will be reflected in the export-package directive as well)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/felix/issues/comments/195718014/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/felix/issues/comments/196166539","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/felix/pull/57#issuecomment-196166539","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/felix/issues/57","id":196166539,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5NjE2NjUzOQ==","user":{"login":"rombert","id":21237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rombert","html_url":"https://github.com/rombert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rombert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rombert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rombert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rombert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rombert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rombert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rombert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rombert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rombert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-14T06:36:22Z","updated_at":"2016-03-14T06:36:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":">

@dleangen it looks good to me - it's a large pull request so I might have missed something, but I would go ahead and merge.\r\n\r\nThere is one thing however that we should change, maybe in a separate commit. The serializer contains the org.osgi.service.serialize package for its API and I see that in this commit you added additional interfaces to that API. As at this stage the API is not really coming from OSGi any more and OSGi is currently not actively developing the serialize API, we should rename this package to org.apache.felix.serializer (or something similar) so that people don't get confused about this.
