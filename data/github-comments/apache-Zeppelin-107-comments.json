I also think `notebook` is a little bit weird :) I merged your PR thanks.\n\nThis change will affect other insufficient privileges error messages as well:\n- Insufficient privileges to `read` ~~notebook~~\n- Insufficient privileges to `update` ~~notebook~~\n- Insufficient privileges to `remove` ~~notebook~~\n- Insufficient privileges to `write` ~~notebook~~\n- Insufficient privileges to `clear output` ~~notebook~~\n\nI prefer removing `notebook`. What do you think guys? If anyone has a concern about this, please tell.\n\nAnd about CI, I suffered from that error when I tried to compile only one project (e.g. `zeppelin-server`). Since `zeppelin-server` depends on `zeppelin-interpreter` and `zeppelin-zengine`, I had to build two dependencies and `install` them on local maven repo, which can be done with `mvn clean package install -DskipTests`. If not, when it tries to compile `zeppelin-server`, it cannot find symbols of `zeppelin-zengine` and goes to fail.\n\nHowever, I'm not sure that CI only recompiles changed files. I will look into it, and tell you if I get some more information.\n(CI was green before 😭)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/261773204/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/261788961","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1614#issuecomment-261788961","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1614","id":261788961,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTc4ODk2MQ==","user":{"login":"gss2002","id":8833819,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MzM4MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8833819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gss2002","html_url":"https://github.com/gss2002","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gss2002/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gss2002/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gss2002/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gss2002/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gss2002/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gss2002/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gss2002/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gss2002/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gss2002/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-20T16:42:08Z","updated_at":"2016-11-20T16:42:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Going to close and re-open to re kick the tests.

is my personal opinion.\r\nFor the Node.js 6x or 7x version, there is no problem in itself.\r\nHowever, I know that many of the libraries in Node.js have problems starting from version 6x or later, or are not being built.\r\n(I think this is due to a rapid change in the 6x version.)\r\n\r\nIf you are upgrading to the 6x version first, we will greatly reduce the choice of many libraries now supported by the node.js community.\r\nOn the other hand, I also agree with you that the current version of node.js is too low.\r\n\r\nHowever, we do not use node.js directly, we use it for dependency management and build management.\r\nSo, what do you think about upgrading to the 5x or 4x version first?\r\n\r\n(Indeed, since the 6x LTS version is constantly changing over time, Zeppelin also has to

They are just concated and added to HTML. Are not they?

it?\r\n\r\nAlthough it's not configurable through the web, `ZEPPELIN_INTERPRETER_CONNECT_TIMEOUT` is  already configurable through conf/zeppelin-env.sh or conf/zeppelin-site.xml. \r\nSo some unusual

Maybe we can put it on the top left corner of a paragraph and other interpreters can use the location to give their interpreter specific buttons, options.\r\n- What about using uppercase chars like `SPARK JOB` because we are already using uppercases in `FINISHED`\r\n- If when I clicked `hide output` button on a paragraph, `Spark job` button doesn't disappear.
