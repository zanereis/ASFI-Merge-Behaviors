Since adding a policy in ranger will lead to several secs delay, and we use sleep() to ensure policy is ready. If we add policy for each query, the total sleep time is linear to the case number. So we choose to use run all the queries by different users and add policies firstly and then sleep only once, finally we run all the queries again with added policies to check whether policies work.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hawq/issues/comments/282958449/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hawq/issues/comments/282959020","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hawq/pull/1149#issuecomment-282959020","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hawq/issues/1149","id":282959020,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4Mjk1OTAyMA==","user":{"login":"edespino","id":1277466,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzc0NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1277466?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edespino","html_url":"https://github.com/edespino","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edespino/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edespino/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edespino/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edespino/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edespino/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edespino/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edespino/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edespino/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edespino/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-28T06:59:20Z","updated_at":"2017-02-28T06:59:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the review @stanlyxiang.

'make install DESTDIR=/destdir/usr/local/apache-hawq' is not working for all the files. For example: our configuration files under 'etc' folder. Build rpm from source tarball relies on this 'DESTDIR' option.\r\n\r\n2. Some python modules(pygresql etc...) compile is not in 'make' stage, but in 'make install' stage, it will cause compile errors if we enabled 'DESTDIR' as it can't find some pre-installed dependencies in the '--prefix' directory. See:\r\n\r\n`Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"setup.py\", line 104, in <module>\r\n    mk_include()\r\n  File \"setup.py\", line 75, in mk_include\r\n    for f in os.listdir(pg_include_dir_server):\r\nOSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/usr/local/apache-hawq/include/postgresql/server'`\r\n\r\nWill spend some more time to check if we can fix above issues quickly.\r\n\r\nNow we have a hack to set the install directory directly to %{buildroot}%{installdir}, then we do 'make install' without 'DESTDIR' option.
