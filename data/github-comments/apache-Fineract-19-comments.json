But let's not redo this, but keep going. (The beautificating your IDE did behind your back appears to be related to max. line length? That is actually one of the Checkstyle modules... note `LineLength` - but let's get to that later, only; it has less priority (value) than e.g. the logging and exception handling related checks. But when we do get to that, we can discuss just exactly how long we want lines to be maximum. I think your IDE has it set to be too short; there's no need to break everything at 80 - the (right now still commented out) config currently has it at 120, but personally I'd probably even go for something bigger, like 160 or perhaps 140.
