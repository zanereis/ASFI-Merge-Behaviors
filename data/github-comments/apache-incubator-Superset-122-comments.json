Is there any configuration like if i add a new database on one instance the same database is automatically added on the other instance. \r\nFor example I have one instance of a superset running on one server and i add a database on it.\r\nI have one other superset on a other server. If i open this second instance i could see the database which i  added in the first server automatically reflecting on the second server.\r\n\r\nHope i made my query understandable","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/367252238/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/367252721","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/4453#issuecomment-367252721","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/4453","id":367252721,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NzI1MjcyMQ==","user":{"login":"xrmx","id":12932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx","html_url":"https://github.com/xrmx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-21T08:44:56Z","updated_at":"2018-02-21T08:44:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@devJamdagni I was talking about the database used by superset to store the metadata.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/367252721/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/367253086","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/4453#issuecomment-367253086","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/4453","id":367253086,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NzI1MzA4Ng==","user":{"login":"devJamdagni","id":36667221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NjY3MjIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36667221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/devJamdagni","html_url":"https://github.com/devJamdagni","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devJamdagni/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devJamdagni/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devJamdagni/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devJamdagni/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devJamdagni/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devJamdagni/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devJamdagni/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devJamdagni/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devJamdagni/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-21T08:46:28Z","updated_at":"2018-02-21T08:46:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Ok.. sorry i am new to suerset.
