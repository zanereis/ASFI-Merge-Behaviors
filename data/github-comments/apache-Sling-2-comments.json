Therefore the retry is only done with the next cycle of the OSGi Installer (e.g. when a new bundle is supposed to be installed/updated). That seems to be wrong here, because it may cause a very long delay until the bundle update is actually retried. I would therefore go for a sleep and retry approach here.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/sling-old-svn-mirror/issues/comments/280012234/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/sling-old-svn-mirror/issues/comments/280013401","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/sling-old-svn-mirror/pull/199#issuecomment-280013401","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/sling-old-svn-mirror/issues/199","id":280013401,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MDAxMzQwMQ==","user":{"login":"karlpauls","id":410610,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMDYxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/410610?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlpauls","html_url":"https://github.com/karlpauls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlpauls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlpauls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlpauls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlpauls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlpauls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlpauls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlpauls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlpauls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlpauls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-15T13:42:13Z","updated_at":"2017-02-15T13:42:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I'm going to apply this patch and do a release. \r\n\r\n@kwin I did comment a bit more on your points on SLING-5457.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/sling-old-svn-mirror/issues/comments/280013401/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/sling-old-svn-mirror/issues/comments/280019659","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/sling-old-svn-mirror/pull/199#issuecomment-280019659","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/sling-old-svn-mirror/issues/199","id":280019659,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MDAxOTY1OQ==","user":{"login":"DominikSuess","id":3097393,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTczOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3097393?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DominikSuess","html_url":"https://github.com/DominikSuess","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DominikSuess/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DominikSuess/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DominikSuess/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DominikSuess/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DominikSuess/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DominikSuess/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DominikSuess/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DominikSuess/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DominikSuess/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-15T14:08:30Z","updated_at":"2017-02-15T14:08:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@kwin the osgi installer cycle at the end compacts the persistentList in case any Resource is left the next cycle is immediately triggered (return ACTION.CYCLE;) This is why setting to IGNORE breaks the cycle but exiting a TaskResource unhandled causes the next cycle.
