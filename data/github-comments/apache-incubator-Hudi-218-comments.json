When will commit the `SAVE_SCHEMA_ACTION` file? Once that schema is changed ?\r\n> 4. How to make the Hudi Table with old version like 0.10 compatible with this ? If enable `hoodie.schema.evolution.enable` on an existed old-version hudi table, what will happen? Or we are not about to make them compatible,  then how to refuse this.\r\n> 5. this pr can work when enable `hoodie.metadata.enable` ?\r\n> 6. why we need to separate Spark3.1 and Spark3.2?

If I understand correctly, this change in schema evolution results in vectorized reading not working in BaseFileOnlyViewRelation. Correct? If so, can we fix it in this PR itself instead of next PR.  Are tables only with schema evolution enabled will not have vectorized working or all the tables (even when there is no schema evolution) affected with the change in BaseFileOnlyViewRelation?  \r\n\r\nAlso, you mentioned that you have removed old hudi relation. Is this the fix for improving the vectorized reading.

However in my case, I did a full load of a table that had close to a billion records and with 30 worker nodes, it took around 16 minutes using a partitioning key on a data column. When I tried to run an upsert operation on the same table with about 1.5 million records, the Glue job fails with no more containers available, which indicates that there is a memory issue/disk spill.

If I understand correctly, this change in schema evolution results in vectorized reading not working in BaseFileOnlyViewRelation. Correct? If so, can we fix it in this PR itself instead of next PR.

We use the internal schema to control all evolution logic. There is no internal schema in the history table. They directly fall back to the original logic，\r\n2）we can also use this  feature to operate old hudi table,  We just need to start schema evolution,\r\n3）if we use old hudi version to query new version evolved hudi table,  compatibility is not guaranteed.  but if you evolution is consisent with the evolution of old version of hudi， old hudi version call still query new version evoled hudi table\r\n**question4**： \r\nthis pr can work when enable hoodie.metadata.enable ?\r\nOf course, it's obvious， hoodie.metadata.enable is enabled by default\r\n\r\nquestion5：\r\nwhy we need to separate Spark3.1 and Spark3.2? See more repeated codes. so try to optimize them if indeed need to deal with spark3.1 and spark3.2 separately.\r\nanwer： This is very difficult\r\n1）we donot support datasourceV2 on spark3.1， In other words, Hudi currently does not support all DDL operations on spark3.1 we sould inject rule to support that;  howver hudi  support dsV2 on spark3.2.1\r\n2）dsV2 DDL opertion  interface changed drasticly in spark3.1 and spark3.2.1  and This change will tend to be stable in the future, At least spark 3 2.1 and spark 3 3 is consistent\r\n3）we need a new paruqet reader to support schema evolution.  but the interface also changed in spark3.1 and spark3.2.1， and This change will tend to be stable in the future, At least spark 3 2.1 and spark 3 3 is consistent\r\n4) Unlike iceberg, hudi do not implement its own parquet file reader. Iceberg directly writes the capability of schema evolution into his file reader, so Hudi must adapt to different versions at present","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1080120016/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1080120399","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/4910#issuecomment-1080120399","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4910","id":1080120399,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5AYVRP","user":{"login":"xiarixiaoyao","id":13514703,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTE0NzAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13514703?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiarixiaoyao","html_url":"https://github.com/xiarixiaoyao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiarixiaoyao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiarixiaoyao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiarixiaoyao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiarixiaoyao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiarixiaoyao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiarixiaoyao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiarixiaoyao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiarixiaoyao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiarixiaoyao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-28T02:38:47Z","updated_at":"2022-03-28T02:38:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bvaradar   addressed all comments\r\nAre there any other concerns?
