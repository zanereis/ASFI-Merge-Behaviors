i keep the same params like `--partition-path-field=timestamp16, --hive-sync-partition-fields=timestamp16`. There will be some question:\r\n1、In the schema the _timestamp16_ is a bigint type. When we use _timestamp16_ as a partition field. It will be a string type in hive schema. The bigint type can't convert to a string. So that `select timestamp16 from testTable;` will also return null.\r\n\r\n2、In KeyGenerator we use the _PARTITIONPATH_FIELD_NAME_  to get a partition path, we use the _HIVE_SYNC_PARTITION_FIELDS_  as a partition field sync to hive . Sometimes these two params keep same will be good when the field is string type . But The TimestampBasedAvroKeyGenerator relies on timestamps for the partition field. The field values are interpreted as timestamps and not just converted to string while generating partition path value for records . When use  TimestampBasedAvroKeyGenerator the `1596074902000L`  will converted to a string partition path like `2020-07-30` . In this case the hive partition field should use another field as a partition field instead of use the partition path field which the field values is another values.

Before going into the details please also consider: \r\n\r\n**Hudi Changes**\r\n- Recently we have upgraded to Hudi 0.10.0 and thus all our tables now have been updated accordingly \r\n- The table(s) in question use BLOOM index (previously this was GLBOAL_BLOOM) \r\n- _hoodie.payload.ordering.field_ has been set to the same value of _hoodie.datasource.write.precombine.field_\r\n- _hoodie.upsert.shuffle.parallelism_ has been set to same value of _spark.sparkContext.defaultParallelism.toString_\r\n\r\n**Real Time Flow**\r\n- We have a real-time flow consuming, processing, and persisting data to Hudi using Spark structured streaming\r\n- In the most common scenario the flow reads 1 or 2 files of avro data each around 25MB (compacted via NiFi)\r\n- This flow has been successfully running for a while but we think performance can be improved\r\n- Our question at this point is if all this resources (seen hereunder) are needed given the small data input size that we have\r\n> num-executors 3 \r\n> executor-cores 3 \r\n> executor-memory 5400m \r\n> spark.driver.memoryOverhead=1024m \r\n> spark.sql.shuffle.partitions=18 \r\n> spark.default.parallelism=18 \r\n\r\n **Reload Flow**\r\n- Apart from the real-time flow we sometimes require to reload data in a separate flow, pausing the real-time one. \r\n- The input data for this flow is as originally described (Avro Files | 25MB each | 250 / 6GB per day)\r\n- In our opinion this flow is taking too long to execute given the amount of resources (see hereunder) and size of data\r\n- Is there any recommended parameter and/or option to look into which might drastically improve performance? \r\n\r\n> num-executors 5\r\n> executor-cores 5\r\n> executor-memory 7900m \r\n> spark.driver.memoryOverhead=1020m \r\n> spark.sql.shuffle.partitions=50 \r\n> spark.default.parallelism=50\r\n\r\n\r\nShould you require any additional details please reach out to us so that we may provide them.

Very valuable idea!\r\n> \r\n> Further, maybe we can do more interesting things based on this very valuable hudi metastore server, which is beneficial to realize **Hudi Lake Manager** which could decouple hudi ingestion and hudi table service, including cleaner, archival, clustering, compaction and any table services in the feature.\r\n> \r\n> And this lake manager could unify and automatically call put services such as cleaner/clustering/compaction/archive(multi-writer and async) based on this metastore server.\r\n> \r\n> Users only need to care about their own ingest pipline
