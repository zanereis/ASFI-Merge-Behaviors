I have been explaining to you guys in previous comments: my broader concern is NOT about generated POJO, is about using a same user defined POJO class across many different systems using AVRO as the standard serialization format where people are using `ReflectData` not `ReflectData.AllowNull` (the second case explained at https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/3741#issuecomment-469506795). \r\n\r\n> my implementation could just have easily set allow null.

It should preserve what AVRO *preserves* for everyone because this is the rules of all other systems follow when using AVRO. That's the most important thing when AVRO is used as a standard data format across data systems.
