this is isn't my area of expertise (I'm not sure who at Typesafe/EFPL is currently responsible for the development/maintenance of the REPL, thus I don't know who could comment on future plans/roadmap)\n\nHowever,\n1. I think the reliance of this patch on `invalidateClassPathEntries` (removed in scala/scala#3884) is inconsequential because I get from @gkossakowski’s comment (https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/3884#issuecomment-49277957) that this functionality can easily (and will most likely) be provided by the 2.11.x’s new classpath handling code. So, the approach taken in this PR is _probably_ still valid into 2.11. Though, obligatory to note that of course, we don't know yet what it'll look like, or precisely when it’ll hit, but since SI-6502 is \"major\" and it has an owner, I would bet on it being included in 2.11.x.\n2. There were some questions above about reflection – I second your Java reflection-based approach for two reasons. (1) As many know, Scala reflection is not thread-safe in 2.10.x, but perhaps more importantly (2) it’s an experimental API that is still fluctuating, and has fluctuated quite a bit so far between 2.10.x and 2.11.x. That said, it’s just a safer, stabler bet to rely on Java reflection if you can for now.\n\nSince I’m not the foremost expert on this stuff, I’m also going to ping @gkossakowski (our best bet haha) – hopefully he can confirm/deny/clarify these insights?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/52532231/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/52532375","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/2018#issuecomment-52532375","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/2018","id":52532375,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNTMyMzc1","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-18T18:15:40Z","updated_at":"2014-08-18T18:15:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"

, some questions:\n- How do you plan to resolve the protobuf version requirement/conflict (akka 2.3 specifically requires protobuf 2.5, hadoop1 specifically requires 2.4), I think currently this patch is still using 2.4\n- Is it really necessary to import all of SparkILoop.scala? From what I understand for 2.11 (and onwards) we can have a scala version independent repl without having to import any such code from scala. I have a prototype implementation of such a repl (2.11+ based) I did for Mahout, which seems to be much smaller/simpler.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/52544191/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/52544364","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/2019#issuecomment-52544364","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/2019","id":52544364,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNTQ0MzY0","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-18T19:45:18Z","updated_at":"2014-08-18T19:45:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"

Marcelo,\n\nI took a look through this - I also discussed in some detail with @srowen this past weekend. If we want to fix this problem using shading in our build, this seems like as good a way as any to do it. It does substantially increase the complexity of the build which is not great, so maybe longer term we could consider moving towards just publishing a shaded version of guava upstream.\n\nRegarding this specific implementation, I noticed there is a lot of effort to mirror this logic in the sbt build. I wonder if maybe we should just leave this out of the sbt build entirely to reduce the complexiy and in the sbt build simply have guava be a compile time dependency like it was before. We've said in the past that our official reference build for packagers is maven, so I think it's fine if some of the more esoteric build configurations do not exist in sbt.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/52549981/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/52551067","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1934#issuecomment-52551067","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1934","id":52551067,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNTUxMDY3","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-18T20:35:23Z","updated_at":"2014-08-18T20:35:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"
