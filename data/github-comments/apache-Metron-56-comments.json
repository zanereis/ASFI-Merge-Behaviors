They are:\r\n\r\n- solr.zookeeper\r\n- solr.commitPerBatch\r\n- solr.commit.waitSearcher\r\n- solr.commit.waitFlush\r\n- solr.commit.soft\r\n- solr.collection\r\n- solr.http.config\r\n\r\nCurrently Ambari only exposes the \"solr.zookeeper\" parameter which is necessary to get the indexing topology writing to Solr.  I think a reasonable solution would be to include all the others except \"solr.http.config\" since it's an advanced config.  Storm tuning parameters are independent of the writer implementation and already exposed in Ambari.  \r\n\r\nFor the collection service actions, it would mirror what we expose for ES:  creating and deleting templates (schemas in Solr terms).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/364972221/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/365234535","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/936#issuecomment-365234535","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/936","id":365234535,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NTIzNDUzNQ==","user":{"login":"JonZeolla","id":1385510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODU1MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1385510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla","html_url":"https://github.com/JonZeolla","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-13T11:11:07Z","updated_at":"2018-02-13T11:12:10Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Would you also mind updating the [main README](https://github.com/apache/metron/blob/master/metron-platform/metron-indexing/README.md)?

latest commit switches the persistence for storing user settings to HBase rather than a RDBMS as discussed on the dev list.  Instead of fields being stored in RDBMS columns, the user settings object is now serialized with Jackson and stored in HBase as a byte[].  This required several changes including:\r\n\r\n- Added code to setup HBase in the MPack, following the update table pattern in the indexing MPack scripts as an example\r\n- Added default table/cf values to REST properties\r\n- Added a Config class to the REST app to setup an HBase client\r\n- Added a Service class to the REST app that manages user settings in HBase\r\n- Added tests for all new classes and updated existing tests\r\n- Updated the REST README\r\n\r\nI also refactored some areas to make things clearer and easier to understand:\r\n\r\n- Renamed AlertProfile to UserSettings and moved the endpoints to the UserController.  The thinking is that we may not want this to be limited to just the Alerts UI.\r\n- Refactored the REST MPack scripts to more closely align with other components in regards to setting up Kafka, HBase, etc.\r\n- Removed the Optional fields from a couple model classes.  This was causing issues with Jackson and I don't believe it benefits us enough to have to deal with that complexity.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of design issues to consider when reviewing this.  The implementation in the REST app is specific to this use case.  I considered trying to make it more generic for future HBase use cases but decided to keep it simple for now.   Instead of trying to predict what those use cases look like and choose a pattern that works, I decided to leave that to whoever implements a new use case in the future.  I also considered making this generic to all of Metron but again, decided to keep it simple.  Should these settings be limited to just REST/UIs?  Any thoughts on this?\r\n\r\nThis has been tested in full dev and all tests are passing.  In full dev, navigate to the UserController and use the various endpoints to save and retrieve settings for the currently logged in user.  You should also be able to log in as the admin user and see all user settings and delete an individual user's settings.  I also tested evolving the user settings model by adding new fields and it worked without issue.  Users with existing settings just return null for new fields.

I'm not familiar enough with why we forked to understand what we're possibly giving up or exchanging by switching to the main centos Vagrant image.\r\n\r\nSure, I'll try to explain what I remember and justify the change.  Better to do our due diligence here.\r\n\r\nBack then, we had some issues where the CentOS image would be updated and our Ansible deployment scripts would no longer work.  A couple times we'd wake up in the morning with a broken dev environment when we hadn't changed anything in Metron.  \r\n\r\nAs I remember it, this was back when we were just getting started.  All of Metron was deployed via Ansible, different Ansible versions would have different behaviors and break things, and it was generally a very painful experience.  \r\n\r\nBack then we valued a stable dev environment over more rigorous testing.  The Ansible scripts themselves have always just been a means to deploy Metron in a dev environment and not necessarily something that we want to support as part of Metron.  We didn't care all that much if the Ansible scripts didn't work in all CentOS environments, they are just for our dev environment.\r\n\r\nFast forward to now and most of the deployment process is part of the MPack. The MPack is something that we expect our users to actually use in their own environments.  Today, the MPack is a core part of Metron itself.  \r\n\r\nIf a patch in CentOS occurs that breaks our MPack, then I definitely want to know about that.  Given that, today I think we want to prioritize rigorous testing over a stable dev environment.
