for the report. While the bug was unintended, I'm tempted to file as \"won't fix\", with the following rationale:\n- We've discussed before our preference for deprecating the `whisk` object and moving towards an `npm` module.\n- The `.async()`/`.done()` flow can be implemented with `Promise`s (even in the older Node runtime)\n- Invoking actions and firing triggers can be done with the [`npm` `openwhisk` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/openwhisk).\n  - The required credentials can be retrieved as environment variables: `process.env.EDGE_HOST` and `process.env.AUTH_KEY`. **Addendum**: see end of post.\n  - It is in fact easier to test actions locally this way.\n  - We still have the issue that the action namespace (or name) is not exposed to the user, which may be an issue in certain scenarios (see #387 on a related topic).\n\nI propose to make the points above part of the official documentation and proceed with marking the `whisk` object as unavailable in packaged actions.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\nCC @rabbah @sjfink \n\n**Addendum**: it turns out `AUTH_KEY` is not actually available in the environment. I suspect this is an oversight; there is code in the proxy to set it at `init` time, which is wrong, as the value is communicated at `run` time (I suspect it wasn't always the case).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/256412420/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/256417472","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/1439#issuecomment-256417472","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1439","id":256417472,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NjQxNzQ3Mg==","user":{"login":"cbickel","id":13397688,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzk3Njg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13397688?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel","html_url":"https://github.com/cbickel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-26T17:19:25Z","updated_at":"2016-10-26T17:19:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"For me, this solution would be fine as well, but I think the best would be, if the `api path` (e.g. https://openwhisk.ng.bluemix.net/api/v1/) is directly available and not only the IP of the Edge-machine.\nWill this module be added to the default module, that can be used without the zip-upload?\nThen we would have the same mechanisms for plain js-actions and zip-js-actions.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/256417472/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/256421520","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/1382#issuecomment-256421520","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1382","id":256421520,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NjQyMTUyMA==","user":{"login":"mdeuser","id":18535381,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTM1Mzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18535381?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser","html_url":"https://github.com/mdeuser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-26T17:34:14Z","updated_at":"2016-10-26T17:34:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@dubeejw - Would you please rebase.
