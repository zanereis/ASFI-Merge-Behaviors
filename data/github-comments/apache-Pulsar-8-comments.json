It means\r\n1. If client doesn't receive `TooManyRequestError` then client will keep this persistent-connection forever.

Also guaranteeing ordering would be challenging as there would be no relation for different publish requests on the same topic.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, I'd be really happy to have a gRPC based proxy service. Contributions welcome! 😄 \r\n\r\nIt may be also interesting to offer the same interface (or at least a significant portion of it) as GCP pub-sub: https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/reference/rpc/google.pubsub.v1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/283774221/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/283801688","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/273#issuecomment-283801688","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/273","id":283801688,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MzgwMTY4OA==","user":{"login":"yahoocla","id":6155154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNTUxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6155154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahoocla","html_url":"https://github.com/yahoocla","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahoocla/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahoocla/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahoocla/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahoocla/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahoocla/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahoocla/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahoocla/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahoocla/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahoocla/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-02T22:22:06Z","updated_at":"2017-03-02T22:22:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you for submitting this pull request, however I do not see a valid CLA on file for you.
