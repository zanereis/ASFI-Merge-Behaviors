Previously, the user could just configure a volume chooser for the logger scope, since that was the only scope where we were constructing a volume chooser. Since introducing volume choosers for the init scope would require the user to change their config, Karthick's latest patch falls back to a random chooser when the neither the desired nor the default scope are specified.

I did see that issue, which was why I wanted to explicitly discuss the desired behavior. My impression from reading over the comments was that it was decided that misconfiguration should definitely throw an error, but I was less clear on whether it is important that absent configuration should throw an error. I suppose there are three possibilities:\r\n\r\n1. require a new configuration property when using the preferred and per table volume choosers (general.custom.volume.preferred.default or general.custom.volume.preferred.init must be specified)\r\n2. fall back to the random chooser instead of throwing an exception when scope-specific and default properties are not specified (absent configuration no longer throws an error for the logger scope, implemented in the current patch)\r\n3. handle absent configuration differently for the logger and init scopes, so that init falls back to random while logger throws an exception (preserving existing behavior for both scopes, while allowing new configurability for the init scope).\r\n\r\nMy order of preference is 2, 3, 1, but I am open to any of these and to other suggestions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/566264417/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/566387421","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/1450#issuecomment-566387421","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1450","id":566387421,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NjM4NzQyMQ==","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-17T05:28:31Z","updated_at":"2019-12-17T05:28:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Based on the intent of the previous issue, only option 1 seems acceptable to me, as it is the only one that properly protects against partial / improper configuration. Any fall-back to a random chooser can place data improperly on a system, that is very expensive to correct later. In general, I think it's a good idea to require explicit configuration from a user, rather than the system to try to infer user's intentions from incomplete or incorrect configuration.\r\n\r\nThe behavior I strongly prefer: the default config should work out of the box, without any special configuration (it does, as the default is the `RandomVolumeChooser`), but if the other choosers are used, they *must* be fully configured, with explicit configuration for any relevant scope they will be executed for. Here, I think this means that during system initialization, the corresponding init scope configuration property, or the default scope property, must be set.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/566387421/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/566596284","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/1450#issuecomment-566596284","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1450","id":566596284,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NjU5NjI4NA==","user":{"login":"billierinaldi","id":1810597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTA1OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1810597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/billierinaldi","html_url":"https://github.com/billierinaldi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billierinaldi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billierinaldi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billierinaldi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billierinaldi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billierinaldi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billierinaldi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billierinaldi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billierinaldi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billierinaldi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-17T15:40:39Z","updated_at":"2019-12-17T15:40:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ctubbsii Are there semver implications to changing how the PerTableVolumeChooser and PreferredVolumeChooser need to be configured?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/566596284/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/566774300","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/1462#issuecomment-566774300","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1462","id":566774300,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2Njc3NDMwMA==","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-17T22:17:36Z","updated_at":"2019-12-17T22:17:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":" I have not tested this yet.

Because it scan more quickly, its able to complete more scans.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ grep -a Normal master_localhost.debug.log | grep 'scan time'\r\n2019-12-18 13:26:43,564 [master.Master] DEBUG: [Normal Tablets]: scan time 78.00 seconds\r\n2019-12-18 13:27:22,673 [master.Master] DEBUG: [Normal Tablets]: scan time 39.00 seconds\r\n2019-12-18 13:27:44,160 [master.Master] DEBUG: [Normal Tablets]: scan time 21.38 seconds\r\n2019-12-18 13:28:04,659 [master.Master] DEBUG: [Normal Tablets]: scan time 20.39 seconds\r\n2019-12-18 13:28:21,197 [master.Master] DEBUG: [Normal Tablets]: scan time 16.43 seconds\r\n2019-12-18 13:28:40,954 [master.Master] DEBUG: [Normal Tablets]: scan time 19.65 seconds\r\n2019-12-18 13:28:59,316 [master.Master] DEBUG: [Normal Tablets]: scan time 18.25 seconds\r\n2019-12-18 13:29:16,469 [master.Master] DEBUG: [Normal Tablets]: scan time 17.05 seconds\r\n2019-12-18 13:29:42,952 [master.Master] DEBUG: [Normal Tablets]: scan time 26.37 seconds\r\n2019-12-18 13:29:58,854 [master.Master] DEBUG: [Normal Tablets]: scan time 15.80 seconds\r\n2019-12-18 13:30:13,870 [master.Master] DEBUG: [Normal Tablets]: scan time 14.91 seconds\r\n2019-12-18 13:30:37,890 [master.Master] DEBUG: [Normal Tablets]: scan time 23.92 seconds\r\n2019-12-18 13:30:55,565 [master.Master] DEBUG: [Normal Tablets]: scan time 17.57 seconds\r\n2019-12-18 13:31:11,776 [master.Master] DEBUG: [Normal Tablets]: scan time 16.11 seconds\r\n2019-12-18 13:31:29,372 [master.Master] DEBUG: [Normal Tablets]: scan time 17.49 seconds\r\n2019-12-18 13:31:45,990 [master.Master] DEBUG: [Normal Tablets]: scan time 16.51 seconds\r\n2019-12-18 13:32:00,815 [master.Master] DEBUG: [Normal Tablets]: scan time 14.72 seconds\r\n2019-12-18 13:32:12,827 [master.Master] DEBUG: [Normal Tablets]: scan time 11.91 seconds\r\n2019-12-18 13:32:23,969 [master.Master] DEBUG: [Normal Tablets]: scan time 11.04 seconds\r\n2019-12-18 13:32:35,357 [master.Master] DEBUG: [Normal Tablets]: scan time 11.28 seconds\r\n2019-12-18 13:32:49,911 [master.Master] DEBUG: [Normal Tablets]: scan time 14.40 seconds\r\n2019-12-18 13:33:02,303 [master.Master] DEBUG: [Normal Tablets]: scan time 12.28 seconds\r\n2019-12-18 13:33:11,660 [master.Master] DEBUG: [Normal Tablets]: scan time 9.26 seconds\r\n2019-12-18 13:33:21,043 [master.Master] DEBUG: [Normal Tablets]: scan time 9.28 seconds\r\n2019-12-18 13:33:30,695 [master.Master] DEBUG: [Normal Tablets]: scan time 9.51 seconds\r\n2019-12-18 13:33:40,911 [master.Master] DEBUG: [Normal Tablets]: scan time 10.11 seconds\r\n2019-12-18 13:33:49,516 [master.Master] DEBUG: [Normal Tablets]: scan time 8.50 seconds\r\n2019-12-18 13:33:59,547 [master.Master] DEBUG: [Normal Tablets]: scan time 9.93 seconds\r\n2019-12-18 13:34:09,308 [master.Master] DEBUG: [Normal Tablets]: scan time 9.65 seconds\r\n2019-12-18 13:34:18,776 [master.Master] DEBUG: [Normal Tablets]: scan time 9.37 seconds\r\n2019-12-18 13:34:26,681 [master.Master] DEBUG: [Normal Tablets]: scan time 7.80 seconds\r\n2019-12-18 13:34:34,827 [master.Master] DEBUG: [Normal Tablets]: scan time 8.04 seconds\r\n2019-12-18 13:34:43,155 [master.Master] DEBUG: [Normal Tablets]: scan time 8.22 seconds\r\n2019-12-18 13:34:50,803 [master.Master] DEBUG: [Normal Tablets]: scan time 7.55 seconds\r\n2019-12-18 13:34:57,880 [master.Master] DEBUG: [Normal Tablets]: scan time 6.97 seconds\r\n2019-12-18 13:35:05,446 [master.Master] DEBUG: [Normal Tablets]: scan time 7.46 seconds\r\n2019-12-18 13:35:12,476 [master.Master] DEBUG: [Normal Tablets]: scan time 6.93 seconds\r\n2019-12-18 13:35:19,125 [master.Master] DEBUG: [Normal Tablets]: scan time 6.54 seconds\r\n2019-12-18 13:35:25,909 [master.Master] DEBUG: [Normal Tablets]: scan time 6.66 seconds\r\n2019-12-18 13:35:31,793 [master.Master] DEBUG: [Normal Tablets]: scan time 5.75 seconds\r\n2019-12-18 13:35:37,770 [master.Master] DEBUG: [Normal Tablets]: scan time 5.87 seconds\r\n2019-12-18 13:35:41,815 [master.Master] DEBUG: [Normal Tablets]: scan time 3.94 seconds\r\n2019-12-18 13:35:43,774 [master.Master] DEBUG: [Normal Tablets]: scan time 1.86 seconds\r\n2019-12-18 13:35:45,194 [master.Master] DEBUG: [Normal Tablets]: scan time 1.32 seconds\r\n2019-12-18 13:36:46,198 [master.Master] DEBUG: [Normal Tablets]: scan time 0.90 seconds\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following shows the progression of tablets (I didn't look at this info for 1.9.3, would have been useful) under log recovery.

Watching the assignment thread in the master (using `jstack <master pid> | grep -A 30 'Watching Normal'`)  I observed it spending time in the following places.\r\n\r\n * sending load tablet messages\r\n * logging debug message about tablet state (like `2019-12-18 13:26:45,819 [master.Master] DEBUG: Normal Tablets location State: 2;3C44AJIF;3C3KH4MT@(localhost:10006[10001b787ff0019],null,null)`)\r\n * reading from metadata table\r\n\r\nWhen this bug was seen on a cluster, jstack mostly showed it doing existence checks in HDFS.  Did not see those with this change.\r\n\r\nBecause my VM was under such stress, I did not add data to tables.   I attempted to do this with the following commands, but abandoned that effort.  Want to do this on the next round.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# create 1000 random entries an insert them into accumulo\r\n$ echo table foo > inserts.txt\r\n$ cat /dev/urandom | base32 -w 16 | head -1000 | xargs printf 'insert %s f q v\\n' >> inserts.txt\r\n$ cat inserts.txt | accumulo shell -u root -p secret\r\n\r\n# could run the following command before and after log recovery to verify data\r\naccumulo shell -u root -p secret -e 'scan -t foo -np' | grep 'f:q' | sha1sum\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/567185234/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/567325667","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1464#issuecomment-567325667","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1464","id":567325667,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NzMyNTY2Nw==","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-19T04:21:12Z","updated_at":"2019-12-19T04:21:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"You would need to be very careful to catch and propagate any exceptions from the renames in the executor, so that the FaTE operation fails properly, without leaving behind a bunch of threads, and without breaking any reproducibility or rollback problems.\r\n\r\nLooking at the bulk import code you linked, it seems like it's trying to handle failures, so if that same design can be adopted here, it seems like it could be a good thing.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to consider is conflicting with the unfinished work in #1060 to ensure multi-volume support works for import table.

The master would thinks its dead, but it would keep running.  I can think of three ways to accomplish this.  \r\n\r\nFirst, we could just make it configurable but this feels wrong.  \r\n\r\nSecond we could write some code in accumulo-testing that uses byte buddy to create a java agent which mutates the behavior of the tablet server code.  I did something like this for [nanoop](https://github.com/keith-turner/nanoop).  Maybe there is an easier way to mutate the behavior of compiled java code.  This javaagent could be built in accumulo-testing and configured in accumulo-env.sh for a test.  This option is very complicated, but it allows testing of released binaries w/o having to rebuild.\r\n\r\nThird we could maintain a patch somewhere that changes the behavior of Accumulo on lock loss.  For test you build Accumulo with this patch.  I think this option is the most straightforward.  For testing released versions, would need to get the source for that release and rebuild.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/572696835/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/572715793","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/1446#issuecomment-572715793","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1446","id":572715793,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MjcxNTc5Mw==","user":{"login":"milleruntime","id":11872539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODcyNTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11872539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime","html_url":"https://github.com/milleruntime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-09T19:26:29Z","updated_at":"2020-01-09T19:26:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Re opened as https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/1471","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/572715793/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/572813292","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/1450#issuecomment-572813292","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1450","id":572813292,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MjgxMzI5Mg==","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-10T00:05:15Z","updated_at":"2020-01-10T00:05:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"My IT run aged out of my CI server over the December holiday season...
