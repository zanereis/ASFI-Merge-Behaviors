The compaction for MOR doesn't have a good use case for our streaming app as the app is doing deduplication on the run and every records delivered will not be modified, not by the streaming app itself. We do have batch external modifications jobs that ran occasionally, but we have the requirements to not interrupt the running streaming app as the most fresh data is always used. With the hudi commits, it seems we can't run parallel hudi jobs committing to the same location even though the streaming app and the external modification jobs are touching different partitions of the table. Not sure whether there is any way that we can achieve this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/918685414/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/918728589","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/3635#issuecomment-918728589","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3635","id":918728589,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM42wq-N","user":{"login":"yanghua","id":2283778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODM3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2283778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua","html_url":"https://github.com/yanghua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-14T01:55:47Z","updated_at":"2021-09-14T01:55:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @vinothchandar Can you chime in to answer this question?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/918728589/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/918733522","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/3571#issuecomment-918733522","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3571","id":918733522,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM42wsLS","user":{"login":"yuangjiang","id":17827037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODI3MDM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17827037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuangjiang","html_url":"https://github.com/yuangjiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuangjiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuangjiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuangjiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuangjiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuangjiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuangjiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuangjiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuangjiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuangjiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-14T02:08:03Z","updated_at":"2021-09-14T02:08:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"    this is my maven pom! scan version ?

Refer to other projects, e.g. Apache Flink, the release branches follow this pattern `release-a.b`, the tags pattern like this `release-a.b.c`.

@vinothchandar Thanks for your attention. Let me explain in more detail :\r\nFirst of all this rejectClustering strategy will do clustering validation three times : \r\n\r\n1. Before clustering performed, checking xxx.replacement.request.reject.\r\n2. After clustering finished, checking xxx.replacement.inflight.reject.\r\n3. Before clustering committing which will create clustering commit file\r\n\r\nThere's actually a race condition that reject file could be created **during clustering committing**. This step will create a clustering commit file and I believe it's a quick move.\r\n```\r\n      table.getActiveTimeline().transitionReplaceInflightToComplete(replaceCommitInflightInstant,\r\n          Option.of(metadata.toJsonString().getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)));\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso Thanks for @satishkotha reminding, I add another validation after clustering commit created, if reject file created during clustering committing, and there's a reject file remainder after clustering committed. We has to throws an exception here to avoid losing update data. -> **More strict we may delete committed clustering meta? and revert clustering commit, I am not sure if it's an appropriate action**.\r\n\r\nIn short this reject clustering strategy can reject request clustering, inflight clustering and finished but not committed clustering. Although when clustering is committing, we can't reject it anymore and have to throw exception.\r\n\r\n\r\n> Anyway, my high level thought is that it is better to find a way to integrate this with Multi-writer conflict resolution mentioned here https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/HUDI/RFC+-+22+%3A+Snapshot+Isolation+using+Optimistic+Concurrency+Control+for+multi-writers#RFC22:SnapshotIsolationusingOptimisticConcurrencyControlformultiwriters-OptimisticConcurrencyusingatomicrenameswithConflictResolution\r\n> \r\n> If we integrate with multi-writer, this can be done in a generic for any two operations (instead of adding very specific strategy for clustering.) Some changes may be needed in multi-writer implementation to enforce priority of operations (clustering is lower priority than ingestion). But this is better long term IMO. Happy to discuss more details/other alternatives.\r\n\r\nI strongly agree that multi-write can solve this conflict more completely. But the disadvantage of this solution is that Introduced external dependencies like ZooKeeper. As the data lake becomes larger, ZooKeeper or something else maybe become the bottleneck which needs to maintain and tune.\r\n\r\nSo that maybe just introduce a new strategy is more convenient to use. \r\nAnyway, each solution has its own advantages and disadvantages :)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/919678701/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/919678981","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/3509#issuecomment-919678981","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3509","id":919678981,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM420TAF","user":{"login":"zhangyue19921010","id":69956021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5OTU2MDIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69956021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010","html_url":"https://github.com/zhangyue19921010","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-15T03:58:14Z","updated_at":"2021-09-15T03:58:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Happy to discuss more details/other alternatives.
