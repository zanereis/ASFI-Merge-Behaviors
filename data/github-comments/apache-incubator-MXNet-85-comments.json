I'm letting the user decide between **L1-SVM** and **L2-SVM** too, so it makes optional 3 parameters besides data and labels.\n\nI made a toy test based on the gtc_tutorial MNIST example and had some bad time because **NDArrayIter** expects by default some **\"softmax_label\"**. I worked around calling **mx.io._init_data** and setting the **default_name=\"svm_label\"**, but I'm sure I shouldn't be calling a underlined function. It looks like a _bug_ ;)\n\nRight now I'm having poor results with my toy test, 7.01%, I believe that's because I should be training a SVM model. I got a bit confused whether K on the derivatives equations are SVM weights or node weight, after this experiment I'm pretty convinced they are really for SVM.\n\nI may need to create two **new Tensor operators**, **L1_SVM** and **L2_SVM**, just like **Softmax** did.
