performance comparison between `master` and `cluster-`, I conducted the above test. The test results show that the read and write performance of `cluster-` and `master` branches is basically the same, which is basically in line with our changes.\r\n\r\nAs for why @chengjianyun tests for a huge performance difference,  I suspect there are two reasons:\r\n1. The query time is too short, only a few seconds of the query, such a short time test results are often inaccurate. So I made the query loop larger during above test.\r\n2. Leader distribution in the case of `default_replica_num=3` may also affect read and write performance. So I chose `default_replica_num=1` for comparison\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/957932611/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/958598635","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iotdb/pull/4234#issuecomment-958598635","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/4234","id":958598635,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCXnElM45Iw3r","user":{"login":"liuminghui233","id":36565497,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTY1NDk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36565497?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuminghui233","html_url":"https://github.com/liuminghui233","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuminghui233/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuminghui233/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuminghui233/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuminghui233/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuminghui233/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuminghui233/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuminghui233/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuminghui233/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuminghui233/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-03T02:07:33Z","updated_at":"2021-11-03T02:09:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> @liuminghui233 Hi, I have some changes on the ANTLR part.

Before merging your PR, you can experiment with the parsing performance of some critical statements (such as insert and query statements).

In the original implementation, when the data type is INT32, INT64, and BOOLEAN, using 0 and False instead of null values will mislead users and fail to recognize null values. Because numpy does not support null values of this types, the new implementation is to use pd.NA instead of null values of this data
