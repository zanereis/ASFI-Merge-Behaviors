But I have small questions about your PR, that are plaguing me. Can you clarify them?\r\n\r\nI've looked at the method #onSessionWrite(). The `sslSys` variable, from my point, shows us that the stage of the current session interaction is on the `establishing SSL` state. I think we may not to register an OP_WRITE here as we don't need it at all for the SSL handshaking and it has its own queue to process such requests. Will it work? (of course, some additional changes at `processWriteSsl` required to do for this case)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/ignite/blob/master/modules/core/src/main/java/org/apache/ignite/internal/util/nio/GridNioServer.java#L3545\r\n\r\n`\r\nboolean sslSys = sslFilter != null && msg instanceof ByteBuffer;\r\n\r\n                if (sslSys) {\r\n                    if (!ses0.procWrite.get() && ses0.procWrite.compareAndSet(false, true)) {\r\n                        GridNioWorker worker = ses0.worker();\r\n\r\n                        if (worker != null)\r\n                            worker.registerWrite(ses0);\r\n                    }\r\n\r\n                    return null;\r\n                }\r\n\r\n`\r\nIn general, about OP_WRITE operation I think the approach can be: \r\n- If we have something to write we just try it. \r\n- If write() returns zero bytes then we will register OP_WRITE (and not OP_READ)\r\n- If write completes successfully then deregister OP_WRITE and register an OP_READ.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/comments/466088622/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/comments/466325057","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ignite/pull/6093#issuecomment-466325057","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/6093","id":466325057,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NjMyNTA1Nw==","user":{"login":"alamar","id":793561,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MzU2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/793561?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alamar","html_url":"https://github.com/alamar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alamar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alamar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alamar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alamar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alamar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alamar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alamar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alamar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alamar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-22T09:02:23Z","updated_at":"2019-02-22T09:02:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Mmuzaf I'm not ready to deep comment TcpCommunicationSpi but I don't see how we will flush data to socket without setting OP_WRITE?

The biggest issue for me was to understand logic behind classes hierarchy and \r\nrelationships between IgniteSecurity, GridSecurityProcessor, IgniteSecurityProcessor, etc.\r\n\r\nAnswer: \r\nIgniteSecurity is an interface that AI is used to authorize operations. \r\nDevelopers can obtain IgniteSecurity through GridKernalContext#security method.\r\n\r\nThere are two implementations of IgniteSecurity:\r\n- NoOpIgniteSecurityProcessor - is used when security is in disabled mode.\r\n- IgniteSecurityProcessor - is used when security is enabled. \r\nIgniteSecurityProcessor gets an instance of GridSecurityProcessor while constructing and delegate it performing of authorizing operations.\r\n\r\nWhich GridSecurityProcessor should be used is defined through plugin as it was earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. do we really need \"withContext()\" notation?\r\nIs that true that we never need to call withContext() several times wrapping and unwrapping the context multiple times?\r\n\r\nAnswer: That's not true, regular case is to start processing with the node's context, \r\nthen switch to request's context or listener creator's context, and then restore the node's context.\r\nSeems, also possible case is to call withContext() inside another withContext() when you have user1's task causes user2's task, \r\nbut, currently we had no such feature at Ignite as far as I know.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/comments/484103115/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/comments/485407696","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ignite/pull/5656#issuecomment-485407696","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/5656","id":485407696,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NTQwNzY5Ng==","user":{"login":"nizhikov","id":880793,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MDc5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/880793?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nizhikov","html_url":"https://github.com/nizhikov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nizhikov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nizhikov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nizhikov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nizhikov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nizhikov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nizhikov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nizhikov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nizhikov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nizhikov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-22T12:35:56Z","updated_at":"2019-04-22T12:35:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I propose several things related to this PR:\r\n\r\n1.

We should support `checkConsistency` for all cache API. \r\nIs there any reason to not support it?\r\n\r\n2. We should add support of `checkConsistency` to any cache related API - queue, set, data streamers, thin client cache proxy. Can you, please, file a ticket for this changes?\r\n\r\n3. We shouldn't restrict any `TransactionConcurrency` or `TransactionIsolation` for `withConsistency` proxy. In many cases, user code will obtain IgniteCache instance from some library code. In the time of execution specific query, there is no way to define if `IgniteCache` can execute the specific query.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/comments/485446811/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/comments/485456731","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ignite/pull/5656#issuecomment-485456731","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/5656","id":485456731,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NTQ1NjczMQ==","user":{"login":"nizhikov","id":880793,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MDc5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/880793?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nizhikov","html_url":"https://github.com/nizhikov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nizhikov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nizhikov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nizhikov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nizhikov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nizhikov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nizhikov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nizhikov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nizhikov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nizhikov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-22T15:52:08Z","updated_at":"2019-04-22T15:52:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Let's
