Currently, we are careful that those IDs are always the same, but this change would cause them to differ. It may be safe, but I'd test very thoroughly and possibly put this behind a flag.\r\n\r\nI'd also like to understand why this is needed. Partition field IDs are stored in manifest files, not data files. Partition field IDs should generally not mix with data field IDs from the Iceberg schema.\r\n\r\nThe only case I can think of right now is projecting the `_partition` metadata field when reading a table... but in that case I think there needs to be a better solution. Running into a collision at 10,000 fields is still possible with this PR. We should just assign new field IDs to the `_partition` metadata fields.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1341825580/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1342074689","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/5967#issuecomment-1342074689","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/5967","id":1342074689,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85P_m9B","user":{"login":"stevenzwu","id":1545663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDU2NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1545663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu","html_url":"https://github.com/stevenzwu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-08T05:33:25Z","updated_at":"2022-12-08T05:33:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@hililiwei

When user remove ownership on a table, revert the owner of the table to default owner (current UGI)\r\n> 2. When user alter the ownership on a table, change the owner of table accordingly\r\n\r\nI think it does make sense to have a support for altering ownership.

me.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1344302142/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1344352419","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/2301#issuecomment-1344352419","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2301","id":1344352419,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85QITCj","user":{"login":"pvary","id":19705742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzA1NzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19705742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary","html_url":"https://github.com/pvary","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-09T14:07:48Z","updated_at":"2022-12-09T14:07:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Are

what it's worth, I think that **the biggest mistake I made with Iceberg was introducing the \"Hadoop\" tables** that rely on atomic rename.\r\n\r\nThese tables have a lot of problems and limitations in HDFS, but the bigger problem is that people choose to use them on unsafe object stores to avoid having a catalog/metastore. I think that introducing these in the Python implementation will only cause people to think that this is a reasonable choice and cause a lot of problems.\r\n\r\nI'm a firm -1 on adding this to the Python implementation.

Even the [getting started page](https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/latest/getting-started/) uses only Hadoop catalog and no warnings are mentioned on that page. I have seen many users using the same catalog in concurrent scenarios and asking for help.  \r\n\r\nBut I do worry that if we deprecate it or remove it, It may hamper the adoption rate. So we are leaving it as it is. \r\nMaybe we can improve the warnings in the document section and introduce a page for catalogs in detail.

PyArrow was imported on the file level, while it should have been inlined. So if you didn't have PyArrow installed, this would cause an issue.

I think the docs are a good place to centralize everything you need to install pyiceberg, setup your development environment, and everything around releases.

Extract a value to aggregate in `eval(StructLike)` or `eval(DataFile)`, which is similar to how `eval` is used for other expressions\r\n2. Create an `Aggregator` that keeps track of the aggregate state\r\n\r\nThen this also adds `AggregateEvaluator` that operates on a list of aggregate expressions\r\n* `aggEval = AggregateEvaluator.create(tableSchema, expressions)` binds the expressions and creates aggregators for each one\r\n* `aggEval.update(StructLike)` and `aggEval.update(DataFile)` updates each expression aggregator\r\n* `aggEval.result()` returns a `StructLike` with the aggregated values\r\n* `aggEval.resultType()` returns a `StructType` for the aggregated values\r\n\r\nThis is based on #6252, but tries to keep as much logic as possible in core/API.

We could have avoided it by more carefully partitioning before the insert, but it's too late for that. This definitely created too many small files -- we've cleaned them up via calling `rewriteDataFiles` in a loop over subsets of the table. But we can't expire the snapshots in a similar piece-by-piece way. The driver reports that it cannot broadcast more than 8GB -- our driver memory is already set much higher than this, so increasing driver memory won't fix it.\r\n\r\nIs there any way to partially distribute this operation to executors? For instance, in rough pseudo-code just based on copying the code from the original post (and making it more Scala-esque),\r\n```\r\nval joinCond = nameEqual.and(actualContains);\r\nval orphanFiles = actualFileDF.join(validFileDF, joinCond, \"leftanti\").persist(DISK_ONLY)\r\n\r\nval orphanFileCount = orphanFiles.count()\r\n\r\norphanFiles\r\n    .repartition(Math.ceil(orphanFileCount/1000))\r\n    .map{fileBatch => \r\n        Tasks.forEach(fileBatch)\r\n        .noRetry()\r\n        .suppressFailureWhenFinished()\r\n        .onFailure((file, exec) => LOG.warn(\"Failed to delete file: {}\", file, exec))\r\n        .run(deleteFunc::accept)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdding a small `sleep` call would limit the QPS against the distributed file store, if that's a concern.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut without a change like this, I'm not sure how we can expire old snapshots/delete orphan files. Are there any other workarounds, besides increasing driver memory?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1345717163/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1345972897","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/6394#issuecomment-1345972897","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/6394","id":1345972897,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85QOeqh","user":{"login":"hililiwei","id":59213263,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MjEzMjYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59213263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei","html_url":"https://github.com/hililiwei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-12T06:41:08Z","updated_at":"2022-12-12T06:41:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"```\r\ndiff
