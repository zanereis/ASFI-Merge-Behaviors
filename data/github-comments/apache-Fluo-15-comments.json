I opened [CURATOR-448](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CURATOR-448) because looking into this  I found the error message confusing.  The error message leads one to believe that curator was not started yet, however I think you could see the error message when it was stopped.\r\n\r\nLooking at Fluo's code it closes the leaderSelector before closing the curatorFramework.  I looked at the implementation of the leaderSelector close method and it does not wait for thread it created to terminate.  So its possible that when leaderSelector is closed and then the curatorFramework is closed that the thread created by the leaderSelector is till running.\r\n\r\nIt would be good to verify that the state is STOPPED when we see this error message.  If it is I think one possible approach is to do something like the following in the takeLeadership method.  However I am not sure how to have  strong check to ensure the exception came from curator because of the wrong state.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  @Override\r\n  public void takeLeadership(CuratorFramework curatorFramework) throws Exception {\r\n\r\n    try {\r\n    } catch (IllegalStateException e) {\r\n      //TODO how can we verify this exception came from Curator????  Don't want to suppress other illegal state exceptions.\r\n      if(curatorFramework.getState() == STOPPED) {\r\n        log.debug(...);  //log a debug message that this happened\r\n      } else {\r\n        throw e;\r\n      }\r\n    } finally {\r\n      isLeader = false;\r\n\r\n      if (started) {\r\n        // if we stopped the server manually, we shouldn't halt\r\n        Halt.halt(\"Oracle has lost leadership unexpectedly and is now halting.\");\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/359848825/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/359852270","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fluo/pull/1004#issuecomment-359852270","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/1004","id":359852270,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1OTg1MjI3MA==","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-23T16:42:36Z","updated_at":"2018-01-23T16:48:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Maybe we don't need to verify that the illegal state came from curator.

My original solution I sit and\ncheck curator state inside of the function takeLadership and wait until its\nready.\n\nI tried moving this check to the start method and I ran Maven verify on\nthis a few times and to my surprise I kept getting some exceptions on the\nstate of that curator framework again.\n\nSo what I did is I left it in that method that is called by leader selector\nand when the check is in that method with a couple other checks like this\nsynchronized on the leader variable then the errors are not present.\n\nThis made me wonder after tracing the flow of what I thought was going on\nin Oracle server, well what the heck is happening somebody else is screwing\nwith something in the background thread somewhere so, I still didn't really\nunderstand what was going on but I left the check inside of the i, I still\ndidn't really understand what was going on but I left the check inside of\nthe is take leadership method.\n\nMy only thought is possibly multiple instances but I thought those were\nprivate variables so not exactly sure what's going on with that.\n\nAnyways I really appreciate you responding and looking into this with me\nthis is the help I totally needed.

Below are two possible ways to accomplish this.\r\n\r\n# Use synchronized\r\n * Make all methods synchronized\r\n * Drop all volatile, not needed with sync\r\n * Drop CountDownLatch and replace with Object wait and notify methods (can do this since methods are sync).  When using java wait, it should always be called in a loop.  The while loop could call wait while the new boolean is not set.\r\n * Add a boolean that tracks if one of the 4 methods was called.  For each method check the boolean and throw exception if set.  If not set, then set it.\r\n\r\n# Use AtomicBoolean\r\n * Add an AtomicBoolean that tracks if one of 4 methods were called\r\n * When a method is called, use compare and set on atomic boolean to change from false to true. If compare and set fails, it means something else called method so throw exception.\r\n\r\nFor either method, Guava's `Preconditions.checkState()` method can be used.\r\n\r\nI posted this on helpwanted.\r\n\r\nhttps://helpwanted.apache.org/task.html?a3862f6ea243e0003cb0992beb127c57598f80ef","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/361649576/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/361655862","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fluo/issues/967#issuecomment-361655862","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/967","id":361655862,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MTY1NTg2Mg==","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-30T16:46:04Z","updated_at":"2018-01-30T16:46:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Project Loom is something to consider when thinking about adding async methods to Fluo's public API.\r\n\r\nhttp://cr.openjdk.java.net/~rpressler/loom/Loom-Proposal.html\r\n\r\nNot sure what the timeline for Loom is.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/361655862/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/361683012","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fluo/pull/995#issuecomment-361683012","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/995","id":361683012,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MTY4MzAxMg==","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-30T18:10:38Z","updated_at":"2018-01-30T18:10:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This seems to be working well.

Or if using a PrintStream, then `checkError()` could be called less frequently like every 100 or 1000 lines.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/362296190/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/362901848","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fluo/issues/1011#issuecomment-362901848","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/1011","id":362901848,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MjkwMTg0OA==","user":{"login":"asr21","id":9569152,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1NjkxNTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9569152?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asr21","html_url":"https://github.com/asr21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asr21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asr21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asr21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asr21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asr21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asr21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asr21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asr21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asr21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-04T12:06:28Z","updated_at":"2018-02-04T12:06:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"hi keith I have submitted a PR.

Something like this:\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/alanblueshift/85437466d7ecf5a001e9a991532275c7\r\n\r\nI really like this idea.  Maybe this could be done without adding anything to Fluo's API by using the Java 8 consumer and injection via Guice.  For example assume someone implemented the following.  \r\n\r\n```java\r\npackage com.foo;\r\n\r\nclass FluoAvro implements Consumer<CellScanner>, Closeable {  \r\n//Closeable could be optionally implemented, if implemented scanner would close the consumer\r\n\r\n   @Inject\r\n    FluoAvroScanner(SimpleConfiguration config) {\r\n       ///unsure if should pass Map<String, String> or SimpleConfiguration\r\n    }\r\n  \r\n    void accept(CellScanner scanner) {}\r\n    void close();\r\n}\r\n``` \r\nCould possibly do injection in the following way.  Injection needs to work with service discovery and instantiation. I am not sure what the best way to do the injection is.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npackage com.foo;\r\n\r\nclass FluoAvro implements Consumer<CellScanner>, Closeable {\r\n   @Inject\r\n    private SimpleConfiguration config;\r\n    void accept(CellScanner scanner) {}\r\n    void close();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nOn the command line could call the consumer as follows.  Having a short name for the consumer would be awesome, didn't realize that could be done with SPI.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nfluo scan -a myapp --consumer avro \\\r\n    -o \"avro.schema.url=hdfs://user/xxx/schemas/file.avsc\" \\\r\n    -o \"avro.output.codec=snappy\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead of using `-o` could have `-co` for consumer options.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nfluo scan -a myapp --consumer avro \\\r\n    -co \"avro.schema.url=hdfs://user/xxx/schemas/file.avsc\" \\\r\n    -co \"avro.output.codec=snappy\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nEither way the options would be injected.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/372339772/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/372370036","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fluo/pull/1018#issuecomment-372370036","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/1018","id":372370036,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MjM3MDAzNg==","user":{"login":"blueshift-brasil","id":34691570,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NjkxNTcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34691570?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueshift-brasil","html_url":"https://github.com/blueshift-brasil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueshift-brasil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueshift-brasil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueshift-brasil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueshift-brasil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueshift-brasil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueshift-brasil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueshift-brasil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueshift-brasil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueshift-brasil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-12T16:21:43Z","updated_at":"2018-03-12T16:21:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"We have to certify the developer respect the scan consumer contract, if not to throw an exception.
