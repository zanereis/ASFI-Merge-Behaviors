a no-std runtime is a nice idea!

There's definitely some common functionality here. Also, once the VTA Chisel port is ready, we'll need a way to streamline building TVM modules, extracting their data, pushing the memories into the (Chisel) simulator stack, and running the test harness.\r\n\r\nRight now I'm trying to get the data extraction rolling. If I understand correctly, you're working on getting VTA programs into your simulation cluster. It seems like the common bit of functionality is flat-packing the VTA module and design in a common format that can be shipped to an arbitrary simulator. In that case, the current sw sim, viviado xsim, the eventual treadle sim, and your setup can all consume the same underlying format.\r\n\r\nIf the above is true, what beyond the initial memories are you trying to extract? It might be worth putting together a proper RFC to see what else people need.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/459936566/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/459936595","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/2543#issuecomment-459936595","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2543","id":459936595,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1OTkzNjU5NQ==","user":{"login":"zhiics","id":5145158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDUxNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5145158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics","html_url":"https://github.com/zhiics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-02T05:14:48Z","updated_at":"2019-02-02T05:14:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"+1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/459936595/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/459937116","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/2543#issuecomment-459937116","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2543","id":459937116,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1OTkzNzExNg==","user":{"login":"tmoreau89","id":5974488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQ0ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89","html_url":"https://github.com/tmoreau89","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-02T05:25:52Z","updated_at":"2019-02-02T05:25:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/459937116/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/459938072","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/2512#issuecomment-459938072","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2512","id":459938072,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1OTkzODA3Mg==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-02T05:45:28Z","updated_at":"2019-02-02T05:45:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Here

I personally think function style works better and is more consistent with the current design\r\n\r\nThe general guideline is to make passe manager minimum, and also allows developer to quickly hack things by plugin simple imperative style python functions","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/459938072/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/459938141","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2524#issuecomment-459938141","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2524","id":459938141,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1OTkzODE0MQ==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-02T05:46:49Z","updated_at":"2019-02-02T05:46:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"docker image tvmai/ci-cpu has been updated","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/459938141/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/459939887","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2292#issuecomment-459939887","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2292","id":459939887,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1OTkzOTg4Nw==","user":{"login":"ZihengJiang","id":17693755,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NjkzNzU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17693755?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang","html_url":"https://github.com/ZihengJiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-02T06:22:44Z","updated_at":"2019-02-02T06:22:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@nhynes The jenkins image has been updated.

Currently, most of the current pass such as relay.ir_pass.FoldScaleAxis, is a simple function of Expr->Expr. This is a simple function, without any states. \r\n\r\nI feel that most of the passes should be exposed as a function, which allows us to do Module->Module or Function->Function. Ideally, there should be no pass states, which is hard to reason about. The pass construction function could be a functor that takes in the configurations and returns you a Pass, which contains an operator(), or __call__ that runs the transformation. In that way, you can use a Pass in the same way as you use current imperative pass functions, except that you might get more meta-data field about the pass for reasoning.\r\n\r\n## Why it is Important to Support Imperative Style\r\nThis is the same story when we talk about declarative vs imperative style code for deep learning. \r\n\r\nThe imperative style code is popular because we can easily show examples to your audience in jupyter notebook, it lowers the bar of entry, we can construct an Expr, run a FoldScaleAxis, print it :)\r\n\r\nThe drawback of imperative style is that it lacks metadata, so that we cannot do automatic reasoning and addition of passes. In the first generation of DL frameworks, we have graph and execution session(which has a rough analogy to the pass manager style) .\r\n\r\nWhat we really want, is the second generation of deep learning frameworks. e.g. functional Keras, or hybridize in gluon for passes. Which exposes the same imperative API, but uses the graph underneath.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/459942347/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/459942839","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2533#issuecomment-459942839","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2533","id":459942839,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1OTk0MjgzOQ==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-02T07:16:01Z","updated_at":"2019-02-02T07:16:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@zhiics can you remove the << in C++ for now and let us first merge in the python side, which is the mostly convenient part?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/459942839/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/459943399","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2533#issuecomment-459943399","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2533","id":459943399,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1OTk0MzM5OQ==","user":{"login":"zhiics","id":5145158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDUxNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5145158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics","html_url":"https://github.com/zhiics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-02T07:25:44Z","updated_at":"2019-02-02T07:25:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@tqchen Removed.

I am not sure how do we define state here. If the function/module changes, we might say it is not stateless. I understand your point that we can do Moudle/Function -> Module/Function passes. But why can we apply the same rule/pass to all the functions? I think we still need module in this case if globals are needed. I might miss something here. \r\n3.

addition to memory maps, data and program management, and notifications, there are two more dimensions you will need: \r\n1. concurrency between cpu and accelerator: \r\n2. interrupts/panics/debug/single-step control\r\n\r\nRegarding 1) the driver of a machine like a GPU or a tensor processor will need to manage concurrency between the cpu address space and the accelerator address space as both the cpu and the remote accelerator might have multiple kernels running, possibly within a time-shared resource manager and multiple users. That concurrency will have timing complexity as the execution on either side can be long lived and is likely to be protected by semaphores and/or monitors\r\n\r\nRegarding 2) you will need a mechanism to deal decisively with failures and observability. Numerical problems, such as divisions by 0, underflow/overflow, NaN/NaR need to be dealt with, as well as resource management problems, such as dead-lock, live-lock, infinite-loop, etc.\r\n\r\nIMHO what the DeviceAPI object needs to expand into is the definition of all these attributes of an execution machine for the language presented by the IR. The TVM release should ALWAYS include a full software emulation of that object so that folks can always run a full stack. When a driver finds a specific target that offers acceleration, then it should connect to the accelerated hardware.\r\n\r\nIt is typically not pleasant to rely on a real hw driver, like OpenGL or Vulkan, for the actual software as the complexity of keeping that stuff consistent is very labor intensive.\r\n\r\nWe need to elevate this to a real discussion topic. This discussion is the definition of what the 'virtual' accelerator's attributes need to be to execute the IR. DeviceAPI is slightly 'bigger' in scope as it represents the least common denominator that unifies all the possible hardware accelerators.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/459991903/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/459991926","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/2543#issuecomment-459991926","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2543","id":459991926,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1OTk5MTkyNg==","user":{"login":"ehsanmok","id":6980212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5ODAyMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6980212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok","html_url":"https://github.com/ehsanmok","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-02T19:23:03Z","updated_at":"2019-02-02T19:23:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/459991926/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/459992423","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2550#issuecomment-459992423","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2550","id":459992423,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1OTk5MjQyMw==","user":{"login":"ehsanmok","id":6980212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5ODAyMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6980212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok","html_url":"https://github.com/ehsanmok","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-02T19:30:29Z","updated_at":"2019-02-02T19:36:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tqchen That's a new rustfmt rule.

We need to elevate this to a real discussion topic\r\n\r\nYes, this should be done now before too much real discussion gets lost in this thread.\r\n\r\n> there are two more dimensions you will need\r\n\r\nI think that the first dimension is something that can reasonably be expected of a `DeviceAPI` since synchronization comes up in any context that's not (host cpu)=(target cp). I'm not so sure about the second, though.\r\n\r\n### Dimension 1: Concurrency\r\n\r\n> multiple kernels running, possibly within a time-shared resource manager and multiple users\r\n\r\nSuch functionality would be amazing to see and is certainly a logical goal. My only concern would be that the scheduler implementation is highly specific to each deployment (e.g., multi-tenancy on an F1 instance vs time/user sharing a device fleet in an on-prem datacenter) and would be more suited to a collection of externally maintained libraries. If anything, the core project would only have stubs that allow such extensions.\r\n\r\n### Dimension 2: Device Control\r\n\r\nI agree that a DeviceAPI should be able to fully control \r\n\r\n> include a full software emulation of that object\r\n\r\nNot quite sure I agree here. Part of the issue is that the TVM IR can be wildly different before and after scheduling for a given platform. Emulation wouldn't offer a reliable estimate of performance unless the program is fully lowered. In that case, you'd be stuck writing an emulator for each and every platform (and, indeed, is what we see with the bespoke VTA C++ simulator).

I am trying to understand the view point of this proposal from LLVM pass manager. If I have wrong principle point, please correct me.\r\n\r\nFirstly, why we need `int opt_level` in pass_node? For the optimization pass, if we turn on O2, pass manager should add SimplyReference, OpFusion and so on. In O3, we should add FoldScaleAxis, however, the pass itself should not have this property. Like LLVM, O2 / O3, the pass manager maintains which passes should be enbled.\r\n\r\nI agree we should have pass structure. Module pass / Function pass / Expr pass. Like LLVM, on module pass, we can have runOnModule, then we can get function. Function pass, we have runOnFunction, we can have BasicBlock. And I don’t think we should have pass state, if you really want global information in Module, please overrride Module pass. Most of cases should override Function pass like we do in LLVM.\r\n\r\nLet us discuss deeper together and pay more time on this topic, I think this is very important to other developers for writing opt pass in TVM in the future.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/460024452/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/460024913","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2216#issuecomment-460024913","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2216","id":460024913,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MDAyNDkxMw==","user":{"login":"srkreddy1238","id":14215163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjE1MTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14215163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238","html_url":"https://github.com/srkreddy1238","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-03T05:36:51Z","updated_at":"2019-02-03T05:36:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ZihengJiang
