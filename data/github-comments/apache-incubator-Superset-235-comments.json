stacktrace is generally super useful, but has potential security concerns. It may inform an attacker about specificities around the environment, and we don't control what gets bubbled up or not.\r\n\r\nI think the intent with `SHOW_STACKTRACE` (config key was introduced super early by me) was to make showing the stacktrace optional. Ideally all areas of the code that may show a stacktrace should boil down to calling a same function so that logic isn't duplicated and can be centrally managed. For instance in the future we maybe want to redact only some parts of the stacktrace, or we may want to assign RBAC-style controls to it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/505076901/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/505077345","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/7752#issuecomment-505077345","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/7752","id":505077345,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNTA3NzM0NQ==","user":{"login":"etr2460","id":7409244,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDkyNDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7409244?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/etr2460","html_url":"https://github.com/etr2460","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etr2460/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etr2460/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etr2460/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etr2460/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etr2460/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etr2460/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etr2460/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etr2460/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etr2460/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-24T16:12:30Z","updated_at":"2019-06-24T16:12:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@john-bodley according to here (https://flask-login.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#your-user-class) `is_active` would be preferable because it ensure that they are authenticated and have an active account\r\n\r\n@mistercrunch Maybe i'm missing some historical context here, but from a security/privacy perspective, I don't see any reason why the `/queries` endpoint would need its own role.

By default this permission isn't added to any roles, but if you add can_only_access_owned_queries to alpha or gamma roles users will only be able to search their own queries. You can do something similar to add a role for Saved Queries. https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7234","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/505643863/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/505651336","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/7748#issuecomment-505651336","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/7748","id":505651336,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNTY1MTMzNg==","user":{"login":"betodealmeida","id":1534870,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzQ4NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1534870?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida","html_url":"https://github.com/betodealmeida","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-25T22:50:44Z","updated_at":"2019-06-25T22:51:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@etr2460 \r\n\r\n> What happens if someone has the same SQL Lab tab in two different browsers? Do we provide a cursor for updating the tabs/queries, or do we just let people overwrite it automatically? How do we sync the state of the backend to the frontend?\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what's the best way of handling this. Currently the last edit is persisted, but not propagated to other open tabs. The implementation proposed would preserve that behavior.\r\n\r\nWe could use `localStorage`(or https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/BroadcastChannel) to store if a given tab is being edited, so that when the user opens the same tab in a new browser tab they get a message warning them, or the tab textarea is rendered as read-only, with option to takeover. Any thoughts?\r\n\r\n> Can the bootstrap payload include the tab details for the active tab too? That would improve load time I think\r\n\r\nGood point, thanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/505651336/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
