Have the Dockerfile along side the src, `COPY` the (already cloned) src into the container and build that beast. It pretty much acts like a Makefile. In that case having the Dockerfile in a different repo wouldn't make much sense. The upside is cloning the repo only once and being aware of local changes the developer might have made.\n2. Pull in the Dockerfile from `couchdb-docker`, clone the repo inside of the container and build. Downside: having to clone twice and it doesn't take local src changes into account because it always pulls from the remote (that's how https://github.com/klaemo/docker-couchdb/tree/master/2.0-dev works atm)\n\nA combination of 1 and 2 is possible, but it seems weird to have the Dockerfile in a different repo if it depends on the source code being

see following use cases for docker images:\n1. Use docker to build couchdb on systems without building tools.\n2. Use docker to run single node couchdb for testing.\n3. Use docker to run cluster of couchdb nodes for testing.\n4. Use docker to run couchdb in production.\n\nI think `#4` is out of the scope.\nFor `#1` you would do\n1.1. Write a build script (`dev/docker/build`) which does the build and COPY it into the image. Update PATH so build command could be found.\n1.2. bind current directory to the docker container under any known location (`/usr/src/couchdb`) \n1.3. pass name of the command to docker (`build` in this case).\nI.e. `docker run -it -name 'db1' -d`pwd`:/usr/src/couchdb docker-image build`\n\nFor `#2` you would do\n\n```\ndocker run -it -name 'db1' -e \"name=db1\" -d `pwd`/dev/data:/data -d `pwd`:/usr/src/couchdb  -p 15984:5984 15986:5986 docker-image run\nOR\ndocker run -it -name 'db1' -d `pwd`/dev/data:/data -d `pwd`:/usr/src/couchdb -p 15984:5984 15986:5986 docker-image run db1\n```\n\nFor `#3` you could use `https://docs.docker.com/compose/`\nOR you could use links manually \n\nSince the commands are long we could have a helper CLI like:\n\n```\ndev/docker-cli run db1\ndev/docker-cli run db2\ndev/docker-cli run db3\ndev/docker-cli run lb\ndev/docker-cli run cluster # --- starts 3 nodes cluster\ndev/docker-cli run cluster 10 # --- starts 10 nodes cluster\ndev/docker-cli build\ndev/docker-cli test\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/144113688/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/144113815","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/340#issuecomment-144113815","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/340","id":144113815,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NDExMzgxNQ==","user":{"login":"iilyak","id":9804420,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MDQ0MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9804420?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iilyak","html_url":"https://github.com/iilyak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iilyak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iilyak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iilyak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iilyak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iilyak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iilyak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iilyak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iilyak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iilyak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-29T16:37:09Z","updated_at":"2015-09-29T16:37:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It is just an idea.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/144113815/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/144117649","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/340#issuecomment-144117649","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/340","id":144117649,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NDExNzY0OQ==","user":{"login":"klaemo","id":778624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3ODYyNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/778624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/klaemo","html_url":"https://github.com/klaemo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klaemo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klaemo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klaemo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klaemo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klaemo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klaemo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klaemo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klaemo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klaemo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-29T16:48:41Z","updated_at":"2015-09-29T16:48:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"You make some good points. :) I'll give it some more thought.
