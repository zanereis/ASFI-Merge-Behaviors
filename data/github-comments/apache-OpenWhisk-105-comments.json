What kinds of performance increment do you expect with custom sharding key?\r\n\r\nI am exploring support for running OW on Mongo and Cosomosdb which support specifying custom partition key. Looking at views used by Couchdb I see following types of queries\r\n \r\n* Activations\r\n  * byDateWithLogs - [doc.start]\r\n  * cleanUpActivations - [doc.start]\r\n  * activations - [doc.namespace, doc.start]\r\n* Whisks\r\n  * [root namespace, date] - For each of rules, packages, actions, triggers\r\n\r\nFrom my understanding of flow the \"whisks\" are mostly read. In a sharded setup this may benefit by using \"root namespace\" as sharding (partition key). In such a case the query would only need to be evaluated on single shard and avoid hitting all the shards for the whisks access. \r\n\r\nThis would be specially useful for databases where sharded queries are done from client which may add higher latency. Compared to this Couchdb proxies the queries and talks to all the shards on behalf of client. As such calls happen within same data center they may incur less latency. \r\n\r\nSo I am interested in this PR to see how to model OW entities on other sharded storage
