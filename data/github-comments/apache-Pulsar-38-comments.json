consideration.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/394479030/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/394479197","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/1871#issuecomment-394479197","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/1871","id":394479197,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NDQ3OTE5Nw==","user":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-04T19:57:58Z","updated_at":"2018-06-04T19:57:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@ivankelly

Avro specific validation on the server side\r\n\r\nI image there should be a validation method in the `Schema` instance. so when broker get the schema info and retrieve the schema instance, it can use that schema instance to do validation. \r\n\r\nthe validation should be part of `Schema` interface or a class in the schema package, and called in broker. but I think we are missing that, that's why I
