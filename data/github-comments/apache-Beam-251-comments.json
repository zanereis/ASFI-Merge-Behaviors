@jkff !\r\n- yes, I had moved delimiter to separator because of the name of the method `findSeparatorBounds()`, as soon as there is only one name, it's fine for me.\r\n- for the `isSelfOverlaping()` implementation: it is more compact and maintainable but a little less performant :) (if we mesure complexity using number of comparison of bytes the new implementation will always do 1+2+ ...+n comparison if overlaps is n bytes or n = length -1 if no-overlap) but it is not important as this method will be run only once per text file, I agree maintainability is more important than performance in that case, just kidding
