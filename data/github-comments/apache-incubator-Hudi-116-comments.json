Although, if you want to later turn on the metadata table, you will need to delete data under `basepath/.hoodie/metadata`. Once the metadata folder is empty, you can toggle the metadata back on and things will work fine.\r\n> There is a change to do this automatically in master now but for your case to debug the issue, I would recommend just deleting the metadata folder.\r\n> \r\n> Sure, I can help you with making the changes so you can build it and deploy the custom build. Before turning the metadata table `off`, you should make the following changes, deploy your custom build and get the logs because once you turn the metadata table `off` and then `on` the problem may not be reproducible.\r\n> \r\n> 1. Checkout the 0.7.0 release tag by doing `git checkout tags/version 0.7.0`\r\n> 2. Add a bunch of logs to the following method -> https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/release-0.7.0/hudi-timeline-service/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/timeline/service/FileSystemViewHandler.java#L342. We ideally want to know which line of code is throwing the runtime exception and why. So, add logs before and after at any method invocation inside will be helpful.\r\n> 3. Run the following command : mvn clean package -DskipTests\r\n> 4. New bundle jars will be available under package/*. Use these new bundle jars to deploy and run to collect logs.\r\n\r\nThanks @n3nash \r\nI have added some additional print outs and I think I got an exception message. The stack trace is still not getting spit out though. I will keep trying to get a better error output but for the meantime, wanted to send you this info asap.\r\nLooks like it is failing on some http request...\r\n\r\n21/04/04 18:28:35 ERROR FileSystemViewHandler: StackTrace:\r\n--\r\n21/04/04 18:28:35 ERROR FileSystemViewHandler: Exception message: Unable to execute HTTP request: The target server failed to respond\r\n21/04/04 18:28:35 ERROR FileSystemViewHandler: Got runtime exception servicing request partition=message_year%3D2017%2Fmessage_month%3D9&maxinstant=20210404152412&basepath=s3%3A%2F%2Fmybucket%2myprefix%2Fmydb%2Fmytable%2F&lastinstantts=20210404172501&timelinehash=1ed939c1abc03590b2f0efbbabea706ca8aef931fdb496732cddaffed5a2b552\r\n21/04/04 18:28:35 WARN ExceptionMapper: Uncaught exception\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/813103178/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/813111663","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/1786#issuecomment-813111663","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1786","id":813111663,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxMzExMTY2Mw==","user":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-04T22:54:54Z","updated_at":"2021-04-04T22:54:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing this due to inactivity.

\r\n\r\nThis looks like a problem due to the version differences between `io.dropwizard` in [prometheus-java client](https://github.com/prometheus/client_java/blob/master/simpleclient_dropwizard/pom.xml#L40) (3.1.2) vs `io.dropwizard` dependency in [Hudi](https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/master/pom.xml#L105) (4.1.1)\r\n\r\nSince Hudi brings in 4.1.1, the prometheus client is unable to find the required method

3.1.2.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how this was tested by the contributor but looks like might have only been tested with unit tests where this issue will not be caught. There are 2 possible solutions here:\r\n\r\n1. Downgrade `io.dropwizard` in Hudi to 3.1.2 -> My guess is this will require some code changes in Hudi since package and API's have moved between 3.1.2 and 4.1.1.\r\n2. Upgrade prometheus client to 4.1.1, build it and then build the Hudi bundle jars with that version -> My guess is this may not require any code changes in prometheus client. \r\n\r\n@vobukh Let me know what you think.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/814678338/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/814682374","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/2771#issuecomment-814682374","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/2771","id":814682374,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxNDY4MjM3NA==","user":{"login":"n3nash","id":2722167,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MjIxNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2722167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash","html_url":"https://github.com/n3nash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-07T07:40:17Z","updated_at":"2021-04-07T07:40:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@stackfun I see that you have some conflicting configs\r\n\r\n```\r\n        \"hoodie.datasource.compaction.async.enable\": True,\r\n        \"hoodie.index.type\": \"SIMPLE\",  \r\n        \"hoodie.compact.inline\": True,  \r\n```\r\n\r\nYou have enabled `inline` as well as `async` at the same time.

However, as you pointed out, this solution should also work against empty inflight files, I.e. clustering. \r\nI consider this a start to clean up and clarify various commit file logics as we have another issue of creating completely empty `REQUESTED` commit files.

Record level TTL -> We don't have such a feature in Hudi. Like others have pointed out, using the `hudiTable.deletePartitions()` API is a way to manage older partitions. Yes, you could partition based on _hoodie_commit_time or any other date based partitioning that structures your table to be eligible for deleting older partitions completely. \r\n2. Duplicates across partitions -> If you have an update workload and are using the `upsert` API, yes, using a GlobalIndex will help eliminate duplicates for your table. \r\n\r\nAs @nsivabalan pointed out, we don't have such support out of the spark datasource but have a low level API as pointed above. We welcome contributions and would be good to add this support in spark datasource - let me know if you want to contribute this feature and we can guide you","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/815456351/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/815457616","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/2783#issuecomment-815457616","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/2783","id":815457616,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxNTQ1NzYxNg==","user":{"login":"n3nash","id":2722167,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MjIxNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2722167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash","html_url":"https://github.com/n3nash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-08T05:27:29Z","updated_at":"2021-04-08T05:27:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@garyli1019 The CI is failing, can you take a look ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/815457616/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/815460958","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/2707#issuecomment-815460958","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/2707","id":815460958,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxNTQ2MDk1OA==","user":{"login":"n3nash","id":2722167,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MjIxNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2722167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash","html_url":"https://github.com/n3nash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-08T05:35:06Z","updated_at":"2021-04-08T05:35:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ssdong Thanks for opening the PR!
