pull request generally looks good as far as the integration with Druid is concerned.  Nothing really seems to jump out at me as fundamentally wrong (mostly just ByteBuffer API usage and code style nits).\n\nIn the IRC channel, it was mentioned that the cardinalities seem to blow up suddenly as the number of things increases.  I haven't spent much time with the stream libraries, but I do remember we had a number of issues around our HLL implementation and merging of the intermediate forms.  There were some less-than-obvious bugs that we ran into and things we learned as we messed with it.  I'd start by trying to duplicate the event stream and merging that you expect Druid to be doing in a unit test on the library itself and see if you can reproduce there (and either eliminate it from the issue or figure out that it is the issue and give them a unit test to fix).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/27354852/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/27363341","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/279#issuecomment-27363341","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/279","id":27363341,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MzYzMzQx","user":{"login":"fjy","id":428325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODMyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy","html_url":"https://github.com/fjy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-10-30T03:44:57Z","updated_at":"2013-10-30T03:44:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"High level comment because I have not yet had time to look at this, but I think this pull request should directly be committed into Druid 0.6 to save the time to port things over.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/27363341/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/27372130","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/279#issuecomment-27372130","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/279","id":27372130,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MzcyMTMw","user":{"login":"himadrisingh001","id":4350464,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNTA0NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4350464?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/himadrisingh001","html_url":"https://github.com/himadrisingh001","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himadrisingh001/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himadrisingh001/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himadrisingh001/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himadrisingh001/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himadrisingh001/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himadrisingh001/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himadrisingh001/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himadrisingh001/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himadrisingh001/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-10-30T08:28:35Z","updated_at":"2013-10-30T08:28:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This can be used for discussion.
