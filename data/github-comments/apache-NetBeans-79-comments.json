On dev@ I suggested to @matthiasblaesing we either delay the integration window on this or it would have to wait unless it fixed a critical / blocking issue. nb-javac landing late in the process has caused problems and delays before, so we need to ensure adequate beta testing with it.\r\n- If this was just fixing NETBEANS-5109 there would be no issue IMO. It's conflating where nb-javac is distributed from with an nb-javac update that hasn't been in testing yet.  I'm not sure if there is a list of changes in the update?  To be considered for 12.3 we'd need to be able to assess what other issues are fixed and whether to roll further betas with emphasis on testing those things.\r\n- Leaving aside ASF and release issues, there are two big end user things to consider - the OSUOSL connection and delivery of prompt updates - as things are we rarely deliver nb-javac updates (I think I RM'd the only one so far), and the update process is confusing for ends users due to multiple cycles.\r\n- Assuming binary compatibility(?) my entire reason for pushing for an NBM on the Oracle side of this is that I think it would be nice to look at pushing fixes to users of 12.3 if needed within weeks, rather than having to wait until 12.4.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/772366450/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/773174527","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2726#issuecomment-773174527","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/2726","id":773174527,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MzE3NDUyNw==","user":{"login":"neilcsmith-net","id":3975960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3975960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net","html_url":"https://github.com/neilcsmith-net","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-04T09:44:25Z","updated_at":"2021-02-04T09:44:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"At the moment, we don't have another beta scheduled, although discussions elsewhere might lead to one.

On dev@ I suggested to @matthiasblaesing we either delay the integration window on this or it would have to wait unless it fixed a critical / blocking issue. nb-javac landing late in the process has caused problems and delays before, so we need to ensure adequate beta testing with it.\r\n> * If this was just fixing NETBEANS-5109 there would be no issue IMO. It's conflating where nb-javac is distributed from with an nb-javac update that hasn't been in testing yet.  I'm not sure if there is a list of changes in the update?  To be considered for 12.3 we'd need to be able to assess what other issues are fixed and whether to roll further betas with emphasis on testing those things.\r\n> * Leaving aside ASF and release issues, there are two big end user things to consider - the OSUOSL connection and delivery of prompt updates - as things are we rarely deliver nb-javac updates (I think I RM'd the only one so far), and the update process is confusing for ends users due to multiple cycles.\r\n> * Assuming binary compatibility(?) my entire reason for pushing for an NBM on the Oracle side of this is that I think it would be nice to look at pushing fixes to users of 12.3 if needed within weeks, rather than having to wait until 12.4.\r\n\r\nSome of the changes that have been made in the nb-javac 15.0.0.1 release is:\r\n•\tMoving the code into githib away from Oracle and OSSOUL Infrastructure \r\n•\tBug fix, usage of “permits” as variable throws error ; https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NETBEANS-5055\r\n•\tBuild and readme related changes so as to enable uploading of nb-javac jar's on Maven central\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/773227009/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/773238067","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2726#issuecomment-773238067","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/2726","id":773238067,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MzIzODA2Nw==","user":{"login":"entlicher","id":5479271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NzkyNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5479271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/entlicher","html_url":"https://github.com/entlicher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/entlicher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/entlicher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/entlicher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/entlicher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/entlicher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/entlicher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/entlicher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/entlicher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/entlicher/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-04T11:28:27Z","updated_at":"2021-02-04T11:28:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Although this PR improves significantly the behavior of C/C++ breakpoints, I don't feel it's really critical for 12.3.\r\nI expect to do further improvements in 12.4 timeframe, thus this can move there as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/773238067/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/773251441","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2724#issuecomment-773251441","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/2724","id":773251441,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MzI1MTQ0MQ==","user":{"login":"neilcsmith-net","id":3975960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3975960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net","html_url":"https://github.com/neilcsmith-net","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-04T11:52:57Z","updated_at":"2021-02-04T11:52:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks @arvindaprameya Assuming the only functional fix is for NETBEANS-5055, and the possibility of regressions is low, then whether we target this for 12.3 or 12.4 comes down to assessing how important it is to get that fix in place.
