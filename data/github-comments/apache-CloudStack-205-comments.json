But that said I don't see how restore is going to be hindered if the vm was created using a full clone. The image is not deleted.\r\nad 2. No it is only marking templates for gc and not touching any cleanup process, it relies on the regular process to do the actual cleanup. The benefit is that short lived templates that will be replaced by cron jobs for instance will be cleaned without having to wait until the VMs cloned from it are all gone (on a per primary store basis btw)\r\nad 3. Yes so far it is I have not studied other hypervisors on this area. The code is now in the vmware plugin but not tightly coupled to the vmware API so generalizing it shoud be rather trivial.\r\nad 4. the host scan task was an empty placeholder with only todo. The vcente clusters are not scanned for new hosts atm. If you look at the old code you can find that the task consists of only a comment:\r\n```\r\n    private Runnable getHostScanTask() {\r\n        return new Runnable() {\r\n            @Override\r\n            public void run() {\r\n                // TODO scan vSphere for newly added hosts.\r\n                // we are going to both support adding host from CloudStack UI and\r\n                // adding host via vSphere server\r\n                //\r\n                // will implement host scanning later\r\n            }\r\n        };\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nhope this is explanation to your satisfaction ;)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/294168606/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/294169715","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/2044#issuecomment-294169715","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/2044","id":294169715,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NDE2OTcxNQ==","user":{"login":"serg38","id":16176702,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTc2NzAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16176702?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38","html_url":"https://github.com/serg38","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-14T15:04:35Z","updated_at":"2017-04-14T15:04:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@DaanHoogland Thanks.

That makes sure we don't issue a session key when user/pass are OK but we still reject it based on the CIDR. In my testing that also fixes the UI issue. There are two ways to authenticate so that makes sense I'd say. It'll then also work with authentication plugins, such as LDAP/AD.\r\n\r\nSwitching the scope of the config is easy, but indeed you'll be querying it on every API call. That does have the benefit you don't need to restart the mgt server when you make a change, but the downside is also obvious. One way to resolve it, is to make a global config setting that switches the feature on/off (and that config is loaded at bootstrap) so you can opt-in for the more heavy checks.\r\n\r\nI'll play a bit more with it tonight.\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\nImplemented the above, will continue testing it in the coming days. Works great, and hitting the DB also seems fine. Loads of queries are done already, so one per API call extra seems to make no noticeable difference. But let's see how it behaves. At least good to keep an eye on.\r\nFYI my code is here: https://github.com/MissionCriticalCloud/cosmic/pull/350","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/294436803/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/294444770","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1900#issuecomment-294444770","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1900","id":294444770,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NDQ0NDc3MA==","user":{"login":"anshul1886","id":1712815,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MTI4MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1712815?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886","html_url":"https://github.com/anshul1886","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-17T10:11:13Z","updated_at":"2017-04-17T10:11:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Fixed minor conflicts.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/294444770/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/294447871","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1960#issuecomment-294447871","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1960","id":294447871,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NDQ0Nzg3MQ==","user":{"login":"koushik-das","id":11499860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk5ODYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11499860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das","html_url":"https://github.com/koushik-das","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-17T10:37:17Z","updated_at":"2017-04-17T10:37:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @serverchief \r\n\r\nThanks for bringing out the old mail thread.

If 'host HA' is proposed as a solution for fixing the VM HA issue in KVM then the questions I have asked is very much relevant.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/294447871/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/294498659","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/2044#issuecomment-294498659","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/2044","id":294498659,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NDQ5ODY1OQ==","user":{"login":"serg38","id":16176702,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTc2NzAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16176702?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38","html_url":"https://github.com/serg38","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-17T14:40:03Z","updated_at":"2017-04-17T14:40:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@DaanHoogland storage.template.cleanup.enabled  is a current global setting so you can't really use it to control a behavior you are about to introduce.

In this case we need to have  both storage.template.cleanup.enabled and storage.cleanup.enabled to be set to 'true'. If we keep logic in your PR in this case it will also start cleaning up templates copies for full clone based templates which might be unwanted in some
