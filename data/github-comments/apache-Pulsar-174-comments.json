Thank the great efforts from Apache Pulsar community with over 110 commits, covering improvements and bug fixes.\r\n\r\nFor detailed changes related to 2.4.2 release, refer to [release notes](../release-notes.md#2.4.2).\r\n\r\nI will highlight some improvements and bug fixes in this blog.\r\n\r\n<!--truncate-->\r\n## xxx\r\n- In Pulsar 2.4.2, windowed functions can work well whether Java Functions instances use shaded JAR or classLoaders, and functionClassLoader is set correctly when the `--output-serde-classname` option is enabled.\r\n\r\nBefore Pulsar 2.4.2, Java Functions instances are started with a shaded JAR, and different classLoaders are used to load the internal Pulsar code, user code, and the interfaces that the two interacts with each other. This change results in two issues:\r\n  - The windowed functions does not work well if Java Functions instances use classLoaders. \r\n  - When using the `--output-serde-classname` option, functionClassLoader is not set correctly.  \r\n\r\n## Start Broker with Functions worker  \r\n- In Pulsar 2.4.2, we can start Broker with Functions worker when broker client is enabled with TLS. \r\nBefore Pulsar 2.4.2, when we run Functions worker with the broker, it checks whether TLS is enabled in the `function_worker.yml` file. If TLS is enabled, we will use TLS port. However, when we enable TLS on Functions worker, it checks the `broker.conf`. Since Functions worker runs with the broker, it makes sense to check the `broker.conf` as the single source of truth about whether or not to use TLS. \r\n  \r\n  In Pulsar 2.4.2, xxx will check whether TLS is enabled on the broker client, and then check whether is enabled with Functions worker. (TBD)\r\n   changed the code to check the broker client is configured to use TLS. If it is, then use TLS for the function worker, otherwise use plain text. (check broker client first--functions worker)\r\n\r\n- In Pulsar Functions, BookKeeper is supported to store the state of Functions. When users attempt to fetch a key that does not exist from function state, an NPE(NullPointerException) error occurs. In Pulsar 2.4.2, we add error code and error message for the case when a key does not exist.\r\n\r\n## Deduplication\r\n- Since deduplication removes messages based on the the largest sequence id recorded pre-persist, if there’s an error persisting to BK, a retry attempt will just be “deduplicated” with no message ever getting persisted. In version 2.4.2, we fix the issue from the following two aspects:                                                                                                \r\n    - Double check the pending messages and return error to the producer when the duplication status is uncertain. For example, a message is still pending.\r\n    - Sync back the lastPushed map with the lastStored map after failures.\r\n\r\n## Consume data from the earliest location\r\n- In Pulsar 2.4.2, we add `--subs-position` for Pulsar Sinks, so users can consume data from the earliest location. Before 2.4.2 release, data in topics is consumed from the latest location in Pulsar Sinks by default, and users can not consume the earliest data in sink topic. \r\n\r\n## xxx\r\n- When the cursor is recovered from a ledger, the ledgerHandle is kept open so that we can delete that ledger after updating the cursor status. If we attempt to close the cursor before having had any updates on the cursor itself, we would end up having a harmless error, saying that we're trying to append xx to a read-only ledger. \r\n(2.4.2 new)(Also, when we append on the ledger during the close operation, we need to explicitly close the ledger to avoid the expensive recovery when loading the topic.)(TBD)\r\n\r\n- If the subscription type of a topic changes, a new dispatcher is created and the old one is discarded. However, the old dispatcher is not closed, which causes memory leaks. If the cursor is not durable, the subscription is closed and removed from the topic when all consumers are removed. The dispatcher should be closed at this time. Otherwise, RateLimiter instances will not be garbage collected, causing a memory leak. \r\n\r\nIn Pulsar 2.4.2, when the type of a subscription changes, a new dispatcher is created, and the old dispatcher is closed, thus avoiding memory leaks.\r\n\r\n## Select an active consumer based on the subscription order\r\n- Instead of sorting the consumers based on priority level and consumer name, an active consumer is selected, which causes subscription getting into a flaky state, where the \"active\" consumer joins and leaves, and no consumer is actually elected as \"active\" and consumes the messages. \r\n\r\nIn Pulsar 2.4.2, based on the subscription order, the first consumer in the consumer list is selected as an active consumer. \r\n\r\n## xxx\r\n- Before Pulsar 2.4.2, broker tries to clean up stale failed-producer from the connection however, while cleaning up producer-future, it tries to remove newly created producer-future rather old-failed producer because of that broker still gives below error:\r\n    ```text\r\n    17:22:00.700 [pulsar-io-21-26] WARN  org.apache.pulsar.broker.service.ServerCnx - [/1.1.1.1:1111][453] Producer with id persistent://prop/cluster/ns/topic is already present on the connection\r\n    ```  \r\n\r\nIn Pulsar 2.4.2, we remove failed stale producer from the connection.                          \r\n## Add new APIs for schema\r\n- In Pulsar 2.4.2, we add the following APIs for schema, in order to xxx:\r\n\r\n    - `getAllVersions`: return the list of schema versions for a given topic.\r\n    - `testCompatibility`: be able to test the compatibility for a schema without registering it.\r\n    - `getVersionBySchema`: provide a schema definition and provide the schema version for it.\r\n\r\n## Expose `getLastMessageId()` method in consumerImpl\r\n- In Pulsar 2.4.2, we expose `getLastMessageId()` method in consumerImpl. It will benefit users when they want to know the lag messages, or only consume messages before the current time.                                                     \r\n\r\n## Add new `send()` interface in C++/Go\r\n- In Pulsar 2.4.2, we add new `send()` interface in C++/Go, so the `MessageID` will be returned to users. The logic is consistent with that in Java. In Java client, the `MessageId send(byte[] message)` returns `MessageId` for users.\r\n\r\n## xxx\r\n- In Pulsar 2.4.2, we ensure consumer background tasks are cancelled after subscribe failures. Some background consumer tasks are started in the ConsumerImpl constructor though these are not cancelled if the consumer creation fails, leaving active references to these objects. \r\n\r\n- Before 2.4.2, it's not possible to delete topics when there is a regex consumer attached to them. The reason is that the regex consumer will immediately reconnect and cause the topic to be re-created. \r\n\r\n## Delete topics with regex consumers\r\nIn Pulsar 2.4.2, we can delete topics with regex consumers. The followings are our methods:\r\n  - Add a flag in CommandSubscribe so that a regex consumer will never trigger the creation of a topic.\r\n  - Subscribe to a non-existing topic, and a specific error occurs, that the consumer will interpret as a permanent failure and thus will stop retrying.\r\n\r\n## Offloading\r\n- There's a bug in how user metadata is attached to a block that if the user doesn't specify both the region and the endpoint, offloading will throw an exception, as you can't add a null value to an immutable map. \r\n\r\nIn Pulsar 2.4.2, change elides null to the empty string in these cases, so that offloading can continue.\r\n  \r\n## Reference\r\n\r\nDownload Pulsar 2.4.2 [here](https://pulsar.apache.org/en/download/). \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, contact us with mailing lists or slack. \r\n- [users@pulsar.apache.org](mailto:users@pulsar.apache.org) \r\n- [dev@pulsar.apache.org](mailto:dev@pulsar.apache.org) \r\n- Pulsar slack channel: https://apache-pulsar.slack.com/\r\n- You can self-register at https://apache-pulsar.herokuapp.com/\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your contributions to [Pulsar](https://github.com/apache/pulsar).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/564573098/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/564574669","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/5809#issuecomment-564574669","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/5809","id":564574669,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NDU3NDY2OQ==","user":{"login":"fangpengcheng95","id":35449692,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NDQ5Njky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35449692?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95","html_url":"https://github.com/fangpengcheng95","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-11T14:40:37Z","updated_at":"2019-12-11T14:40:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"run integration tests","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/564574669/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/564758267","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/5726#issuecomment-564758267","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/5726","id":564758267,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NDc1ODI2Nw==","user":{"login":"phreed","id":211644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTY0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/211644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phreed","html_url":"https://github.com/phreed","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phreed/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phreed/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phreed/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phreed/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phreed/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phreed/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phreed/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phreed/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phreed/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-11T22:16:40Z","updated_at":"2019-12-11T22:16:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The more I have dug into testing Pulsar io-connectors/functions the more issues I have found.\r\nIt appears that the ClassNotFoundException/NoClassDefFoundError is more common that I thought.\r\nI will make a PR for it.

In above case bookie config ` -Xms2g -Xmx2g -XX:MaxDirectMemorySize=2g` should take effect.\r\nIt is a little confuse, But seems no easy way to solve this issue. \r\n\r\n@murong00 From my point of view, 5675 is not too much conflict with 4555, in current code, we could have all the env in bkenv exported, and in these shell scripts, they could be used directly. so that avoid the need to set `extra bookie opts` in different places.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/565303527/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/565305718","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/5845#issuecomment-565305718","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/5845","id":565305718,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NTMwNTcxOA==","user":{"login":"jiazhai","id":6348208,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNDgyMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6348208?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai","html_url":"https://github.com/jiazhai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-13T05:27:35Z","updated_at":"2019-12-13T05:27:43Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks @tkram01 for report this requirements.\r\n> I think it makes sense to be able to consolidate them into a single topic\r\n\r\nThe 'topic' in log4j2 appender is configurable,\r\nIf user want to append all logs into a single topic, only need to set the same `topic` name. \r\nIf want to append to different topic, user also could set the different `topic` name. \r\nI may not understand it well, Would you please provide an example for the requirement?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/565305718/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/565308644","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/5847#issuecomment-565308644","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/5847","id":565308644,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NTMwODY0NA==","user":{"login":"jiazhai","id":6348208,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNDgyMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6348208?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai","html_url":"https://github.com/jiazhai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-13T05:42:57Z","updated_at":"2019-12-13T05:42:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks @julio666 , Seems you already found the version issue .

the main issue I see with #5675 is it's a breaking change. Users who update to a newer version of pulsar will have to change their configurations and that's not a good user experience. Also, all of the kubernetes charts default to using PULSAR_MEM to set resources for the bookies and that will no longer work.\r\n\r\nI agree with @murong00 only variables from `pulsar_env.sh` should

Building on @rcollina 's comment about Confluent, a potential third option may be to reach out to some of the companies that are building platforms around Pulsar (Streamlio?) and see if they would be interested in contributing to one of the existing repos or starting their own. This would give Pulsar an equivalent to Confluent which would greatly increase the confidence that dotnet and Pulsar will be a good pair moving forward, broadening the adoption of Pulsar.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/565587963/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/565597171","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/5847#issuecomment-565597171","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/5847","id":565597171,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NTU5NzE3MQ==","user":{"login":"julio666","id":18533310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTMzMzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18533310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/julio666","html_url":"https://github.com/julio666","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julio666/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julio666/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julio666/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julio666/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julio666/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julio666/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julio666/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julio666/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julio666/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-13T20:28:05Z","updated_at":"2019-12-13T20:28:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@jiazhai no problem, I'll do it.
