comments for the implementation:\r\n- I replaced the `writers` list to a set. Actually to a `LinkedHashSet` in order to be consistent with the `List` implementation regarding to the ordering of the elements. (Although the logic doesn't depend on the ordering.)\r\n- The `writers` variable was moved into the `try-catch` block as it isn't used outside of it.\r\n- I moved the `writers.add(bucketWriter)` call to right after the `append()` call. It means that the first `BucketWriter` won't be added if it has been closed already (so a new `BucketWriter` was created), but it isn't necessary as flushing a closed `BucketWriter` does nothing (and flush happened during the close, anyway).\r\n- I had to change the visibility of the `initializeBucketWriter()` method to package private to be able to mock the `BucketWriter`s in the test.\r\n\r\nTests in `flume-ng-sinks/flume-hdfs-sink` pass, checkstyle as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/issues/comments/295755531/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/issues/comments/297569614","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/logging-flume/pull/128#issuecomment-297569614","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/issues/128","id":297569614,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NzU2OTYxNA==","user":{"login":"eskrm","id":6371196,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzExOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6371196?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskrm","html_url":"https://github.com/eskrm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskrm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskrm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskrm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskrm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskrm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskrm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskrm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskrm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskrm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-26T23:29:04Z","updated_at":"2017-04-26T23:29:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bessbd

It has [getDuration()](https://typesafehub.github.io/config/latest/api/com/typesafe/config/Config.html#getDuration-java.lang.String-) and [getBytes()](https://typesafehub.github.io/config/latest/api/com/typesafe/config/Config.html#getBytes-java.lang.String-) methods.\r\nIf we used the already existing library we wouldn't need to have our own implementation, which, even if we had tests for it, would be very error prone.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\nFor the time unit: the above mentioned `getDuration()` interprets the numbers without any unit as milliseconds, so for cases where Flume expects it to be in seconds we should first try to parse it as number (or explicitly check whether there is no unit set) and if it fails then use the `getDuration()` and convert the returned milliseconds to seconds.\r\n\r\nThe user guide can be found here: https://github.com/apache/flume/blob/trunk/flume-ng-doc/sphinx/FlumeUserGuide.rst\r\nTo render the user guide to html to check your changes use the following commands:\r\n```\r\nexport LC_ALL=C.UTF-8 # Required to build the javadocs on some platforms and in some locales\r\nmvn clean install -Psite -DskipTests\r\n```\r\nThe compiled file will be placed in the `target/site` directory.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/issues/comments/305500097/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/issues/comments/305689504","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/logging-flume/pull/135#issuecomment-305689504","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/issues/135","id":305689504,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNTY4OTUwNA==","user":{"login":"iaiengxia","id":9113145,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMTMxNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9113145?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iaiengxia","html_url":"https://github.com/iaiengxia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iaiengxia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iaiengxia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iaiengxia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iaiengxia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iaiengxia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iaiengxia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iaiengxia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iaiengxia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iaiengxia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-02T04:55:41Z","updated_at":"2017-06-02T07:23:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"To be honest, before I write the tool class, I did not find a library that could meet my needs. Thank you for increasing my knowledge @adenes . I read the source code of config.jar and read the development documentation and did some basic Of the test, now listed under the advantages and disadvantages I know:\r\n**Advantages of using config.jar:**\r\nThe solution is more mature and does not need to test the parsing parameters part of the code\r\n\r\n**Disadvantages of using config.jar:**\r\nThere is no separate way to directly parse a string with a unit, you must reload the configuration file, the change is relatively large, not fully compatible with the original program\r\nCan only parse a number and a unit of the parameters, such as 1g500m this with a number of units can not be resolved (do not know if there is such a demand)\r\n\r\n**Advantages of using custom tool classes to parse:**\r\nYou can parse parameters with multiple units\r\nEasy to use, the change is very small (read the time through a static method can be processed), and has been achieved\r\n\r\n**Disadvantages of using custom tool classes to parse:**\r\nRequires complete testing\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\nFor the time unit, I suggest that some of the recommendations, if I provided in the `Context` class `getDuration ()` method used to resolve the time, if no unit does not need to parse the direct return number, there are units I will analyze the actual unit , Internally stored in milliseconds, but what number of units do I return?\r\n\r\nFor example, the default unit in milliseconds, timeout = 3000, I will return 3000, timeout = 3s (internal resolution into 3000ms), I will return 3000 (return the number of units in milliseconds).But in the default unit for the case of seconds, timeout = 3, I will return 3, timeout = 3s, How much should I return , if according to the above logic I will still return 3000, but the user expects to return the unit for seconds, How do I know the user's expectations unit?\r\n\r\nPerhaps you can use the `getDuration (String key, TimeUnit unit)` method to let the user tell me what unit it needs to return value, but this will lead to another problem, if the default unit is seconds, timeout = 3, I can not know 3 real units and convert them into units that the user expects, because no unit can not simply return the number, and need to be converted into the unit desired by the user.\r\n\r\nIt seems a bit difficult to analyze the time unit, because I need to meet the needs of existing components for time parameter resolution. I can not provide a common way to meet all the needs of the present situation. Based on the current situation, **my suggestion is** , No unit number directly return the number, there are units according to the actual unit analysis, and unified return in milliseconds as a unit of the number, if the user needs seconds, then their own conversion (really, the user needs for the second unit is not the beginning support time units, resulting in too long settings to read up is not convenient)...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/issues/comments/305689504/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/issues/comments/306992807","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/logging-flume/pull/137#issuecomment-306992807","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/issues/137","id":306992807,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNjk5MjgwNw==","user":{"login":"stakafum","id":2041402,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDE0MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2041402?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stakafum","html_url":"https://github.com/stakafum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stakafum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stakafum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stakafum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stakafum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stakafum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stakafum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stakafum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stakafum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stakafum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-08T04:07:54Z","updated_at":"2017-06-08T04:07:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@adenes  Thanks for the review.
