: Thanks for the patch. A couple of comments.\r\n\r\n1. Since none of the topics is available until the broker has received the first UpdateMetadataRequest. Perhaps we could add a method like isMetadataReady() in MetadataCache. isMetadataReady() is only true after the first UpdateMetadataRequest is received. If isMetadataReady() is false, we just return UnknownTopic to MetadataRequest.\r\n\r\n2. We already cache brokerId and rack in MetadataCache.

Thanks for the review. I updated the patch and added a unit test for invalid `DefaultRecordBatch`. I gave it a shot on the refetch as well but I feel it is might be a little too much. There are a few reasons:\r\n1. In order to ensure it was the same batch failed validation, we need to keep track of this state and clear it up when necessary.\r\n2. Now we need to always check to see if a batch is a refetch or not. It is cheap but still feels a little weird to do that for such an edge case.\r\n3. Regardless we do the refetch or not, users that care about message loss will always have to handle the exceptions.\r\n\r\nSo I left the refetch out of this patch.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/305060523/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/305061102","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/3141#issuecomment-305061102","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/3141","id":305061102,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNTA2MTEwMg==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-31T02:03:52Z","updated_at":"2017-05-31T02:03:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer

for the comments @junrao. Both very good points. Maybe we can solve these two improvements separately.\r\n\r\nRegarding comment 2: this is very similar to what AdminManager does. Looking at AdminUtils and AdminManager, there's a partial overlap in functionality. It seems we should eventually put all of the logic in one place. Now that KafkaAdminClient exists, maybe it's best to get rid of AdminUtils as we know it and put the topic creation logic either in AdminManager or in some new internal utils class that clients wouldn't use.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/305089752/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/305090052","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2940#issuecomment-305090052","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2940","id":305090052,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNTA5MDA1Mg==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-31T05:48:21Z","updated_at":"2017-05-31T05:48:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer
