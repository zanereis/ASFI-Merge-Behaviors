I get errors about `bdist_wheel` not being a valid command. I couldn't find where in the Bazel files the `wheel` dependency was being installed. I thought it would be in the `pex_rules` `BUILD` file. It wasn't until later that I stumbled across the Travis CI config file which is actually doing a `pip install wheel`. If this is a dependency we should properly call it out. I'm not sure if the issue is only now impacting me because of the combination of Bazel upgrade and Python 3 upgrade. Either way I will try to resolve these issues, but wanted to give an example of the types of issues I'm running into.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/577500019/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/577701437","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/3433#issuecomment-577701437","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/3433","id":577701437,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NzcwMTQzNw==","user":{"login":"nicknezis","id":181930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTkzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/181930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis","html_url":"https://github.com/nicknezis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-23T14:20:28Z","updated_at":"2020-01-23T14:20:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing this PR in favor of #3438 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/577701437/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/579144987","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/3438#issuecomment-579144987","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/3438","id":579144987,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3OTE0NDk4Nw==","user":{"login":"nwangtw","id":6353055,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNTMwNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6353055?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwangtw","html_url":"https://github.com/nwangtw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwangtw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwangtw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwangtw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwangtw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwangtw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwangtw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwangtw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwangtw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwangtw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-28T09:00:33Z","updated_at":"2020-01-28T09:00:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks!\r\n\r\nYeah.

See the command that fails during the setup intellij script is when the script executes `bazel query \"something\"`.  In this particular case I can open up and see the file it's complaining about in the IDE.  Bazel is searching for Bazel targets containing a file, but I'm not sure how it translates to an IDE yet.  Thoughts?\r\n\r\n```\r\n Joshs-MacBook-Pro-2:incubator-heron joshfischer$ bazel query 'kind(rule, deps(//heron/spi/src/java:heron-spi-javadoc.zip.source/org/apache/heron/spi/statemgr/IStateManager.java, 1)) - //heron/spi/src/java:heron-spi-javadoc.zip.source/org/apache/heron/spi/statemgr/IStateManager.java'\r\nERROR: no such target '//heron/spi/src/java:heron-spi-javadoc.zip.source/org/apache/heron/spi/statemgr/IStateManager.java': target 'heron-spi-javadoc.zip.source/org/apache/heron/spi/statemgr/IStateManager.java' not declared in package 'heron/spi/src/java' defined by /Users/joshfischer/Source/apache/incubator-heron/heron/spi/src/java/BUILD\r\nLoading: 1 packages loaded\r\n```\r\nIf you look at the output above the command claims `Error: no such target`, but then at the bottom of the output you can see it loaded 1 package.\r\n```\r\nJoshs-MacBook-Pro-2:incubator-heron joshfischer$ bazel query 'kind(rule, deps(//heron/spi/src/java/org/apache/heron/spi/statemgr/IStateManager.java, 1)) - //heron/spi/src/java/org/apache/heron/spi/statemgr/IStateManager.java'\r\nERROR: no such package 'heron/spi/src/java/org/apache/heron/spi/statemgr/IStateManager.java': BUILD file not found on package path\r\nLoading: 0 packages loaded\r\n\r\n```\r\nHere I intentionally changed the directory path to make it break.

There is still some debugging to do. For example, I had to add in some environment variables when compiling the zookeeper target. I tried to add the environment variables only to the container to prevent needing to change the Bazel build targets, but adding them to the container didn't seem to fix the issue.  On mac the build passes. On Debian9 it fails because the warnings that are thrown are treated as errors.   I'm not exactly sure why yet.  After adding those environment variables I was able to build a Debian9 container and submit an example ECO topology successfully.   You can find the branch in this repo.. It is -> `joshfischer/debian9`.  \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/584253999/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/584286524","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/3389#issuecomment-584286524","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/3389","id":584286524,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NDI4NjUyNA==","user":{"login":"dependabot[bot]","id":49699333,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDk2OTkzMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/29110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/dependabot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-10T18:38:54Z","updated_at":"2020-02-10T18:38:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"OK, I won't notify you again about this release, but will get in touch when a new version is available.

@dttlgotv It looks like your are using a newer version of Bazel (prob 2.x). You need Bazel version `0.26.0` to build Heron at this time. You can see instructions on how to get this version [here](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/0.26.0/install.html).\r\n> \r\n> Some work is being done now to upgrade the build rules so that we can use an updated version of Bazel.\r\n\r\nthanks a lot.
