Copy operation is good but there also other gcp operators i want to apply to multiple files. like deletion to emulate moving data between buckets. Isn't it better to separate listing and copy in two separate operators? so we could reuse listing from xcom in next operators. Because I want to keep my landing bucket clean of already processed files.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/347514881/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/347515398","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2806#issuecomment-347515398","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2806","id":347515398,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NzUxNTM5OA==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-28T12:56:46Z","updated_at":"2017-12-11T11:11:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2806?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#2806](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2806?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/commit/02ff8ae35dd16e6f23d29d7b24a5fb9c09d0b7a4?src=pr&el=desc) will **not change** coverage.\n> The diff coverage is `50%`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2806/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=WdLKlKHOAU&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2806?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@           Coverage Diff           @@\n##           master    #2806   +/-   ##\n=======================================\n  Coverage   73.98%   73.98%           \n=======================================\n  Files         160      160           \n  Lines       12153    12153           \n=======================================\n  Hits         8991     8991           \n  Misses       3162     3162\n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2806?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [airflow/configuration.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2806/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9jb25maWd1cmF0aW9uLnB5) | `84.01% <ø> (ø)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [airflow/config\\_templates/default\\_celery.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2806/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9jb25maWdfdGVtcGxhdGVzL2RlZmF1bHRfY2VsZXJ5LnB5) | `68% <50%> (ø)` | :arrow_up: |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2806?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2806?src=pr&el=footer).

The build number is given only once the job get executed and not when the job is getting triggered, so we need to poll the jenkins queue until the job execution start for that. \r\nThis required to change slightly the way a request is sent to jenkins as the location in the queue is only present in the response headers. \r\nIt is now fixed and I'm currently testing it. I hope @larrywongl will be able to test it in a state closer to airflow current HEAD (I'm using airflow 1.8.1 so the logging mechanism is slightly different, but normally I have take care of that :) )","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/347953447/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/347954129","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2823#issuecomment-347954129","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2823","id":347954129,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0Nzk1NDEyOQ==","user":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-29T18:36:07Z","updated_at":"2017-11-29T18:36:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @mchalek, thank you for your contribution.
