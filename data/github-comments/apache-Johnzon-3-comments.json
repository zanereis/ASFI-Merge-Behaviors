In fact, just now I resolved the case on my own (by using latest Johnzon 1.2.1 including all the fixes of the last weeks), plus write an adapter. So I now was able to get rid of the explicit `@JsonVisibility(DefaultPropertyVisibilityStrategy.class)`.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, I *now* do agree to your original claim: I do **not** see a need for `DefaultPropertyVisibilityStrategy` to be `public` anymore now that 1.2.1 is published. :-)\r\n\r\nSo the question is, how to go on with this PR / Issue

guess we can passthrough the input (stream or reader or string) and if in memory we could just use it but I was more thinking about just giving some context iterating over the object and not serializing it as JSON but more a simple toString for a subpart, something in the spirit of `var buffer = new StringBuilder(50); var it = object.entrySet().iterator(); while (buffer.length() < 50 &&

not go through a real JSON serialization, 2. not serialize the full object when you only need one field (take the example of a json object of 1m with an url, here the url is sufficient to fill the 50 chars) so it will give some context to the error but also enables to keep performances fine when error are repeated (including attack cases ;)).\r\n\r\nHope it makes

You can also pass the `JsonGeneratorFactory` in as a constructor.  All the state that was in the main `Snippet` class has been moved into an inner-class called `Buffer` that is closable.  Since our design is essentially trying to manage memory I wanted to 1) give the dangerous part a fitting name and 2) ensure all that code is in a class no one can reference.  The `Buffer` class is only ever created in a try-with-resources, so we have 100% certainty no leaks can possibly happen.\r\n\r\nThank you so very much for the code that handled the internal plumbing.
