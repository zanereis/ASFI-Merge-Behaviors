The modification should be very easy. You only need to move the class in the `org.apache.flink.graph.library` package and implement the `GraphAlgorithm` interface. This way, users will be able to use this method by simply calling `graph.run(new AdamicAdarSimilarity())`.\n\nMaking this a library method also means that we don't have to use only Gelly methods, i.e. we can do a few things more efficiently.\n\nFor example, in the beginning of the algorithm, you need to compute (1) the vertex \"weights\" and (2) the neighbor IDs for each vertex. Both these computations can be done with a single GroupReduce on the edges dataset, i.e. `edges.flatMap(...).groupBy(0).reduceGroup(...)`, where in the flatMap you simply create the opposite direction edges and in the reduceGroup you compute the neighborhood sets and degrees (size of the set) - weights.\nThe result will be a dataset where each vertex has a `Tuple2` value with its \"weight\" as the first field and its neighbors as the second.\n\nSimilarly, instead of using `getTriplets()` (which is convenient but quite expensive), you can compute the partial edge values with a single `groupReduceOnNeighbors`. \nSay you have vertices `(1, {d1, (2, 3, 4)})`, `(2, {d2, (1, 3)})`, `(3, {d3, (2, 4)})` and `(4, {d4, (1, 3)})`. \nIn `groupReduceOnNeighbors`, vertex 1 will compute the following:\n- neighbor 2: common neighbor 3 -> emit `(2, 3, d1)`\n- neighbor 3: common neighbor 4 -> emit `(3, 4, d1)`\n\nFinally, you can `groupBy(0, 1)` this result dataset and compute the sums to get the final adamic-adar similarities.\n\nLet me know if this makes sense and whether you need more clarifications!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/123236061/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/123241744","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/906#issuecomment-123241744","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/906","id":123241744,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyMzI0MTc0NA==","user":{"login":"gyfora","id":5880972,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODA5NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5880972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora","html_url":"https://github.com/gyfora","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-21T09:39:46Z","updated_at":"2015-07-21T09:39:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think you should go ahead with it.

In the future we might use this method for something other than just wrapping the messages in a `LeaderSessionMessage`. Moreover, calling it `attachSession` would contradict the idea of transparency here. But we can change it as long as we don't have to do any other decorations.\n- The trait `RequiresLeaderSessionID` is only a marker trait which does not contain any code. Thus, it is effectively equivalent to a Java interface and  in fact Java classes can implement it. The only reason I chose a trait instead of an interface is that all messages which are sent by the actors are implemented as Scala classes. I can change it to be an interface, however I don't think that it cements the language blend.\n- I agree that it's not necessary to use mixins here. The reason to implement the logging and leader session message decoration as a mixin was just the beauty of the implementation. But I forgot about the clumsy names in the log output. I will include the mixins in the class `FlinkActor`.\n- It is true that the leader session ID can change in the case of HA with ZooKeeper.

So I changed the connection between the filter and map to shuffle, and now that map also fails sometimes on incorrect number of inputs received.\n\nI will try rebasing this on @StephanEwen 's barrier

Is there any use case in which you have a `KeyedDataStream` and set `stateByKey` to false?
