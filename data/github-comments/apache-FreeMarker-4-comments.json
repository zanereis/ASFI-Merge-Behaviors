Just to add , since I have not written it explicitly: Basically I was only looking for the equivalent of Apache Commons [StringUtils.isBlank(...)](https://github.com/apache/commons-lang/blob/master/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/lang3/StringUtils.java#L3623)  but as a FM built-in. Just because it is a check people often need. \r\n\r\nWe already know `??` and `!` and use it. Usually our templates are full of `!` (maybe not always the most elegant, but easier for most our users to ignore null and just have it an empty string) \r\n\r\n`someString!?is_blank` appeared to be a bit more descriptive (given the meaning of \"blank\" vs. \"empty\" is known to the template author). So somebody came to me asking if there is a `?is_blank` built-in. \r\nI said, no, but we could create our own `${isBlank(string)}` TemplateMethodeModel function - but a built-in seemed nicer - subjective for sure.
