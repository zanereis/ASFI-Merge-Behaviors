Actually this is a minor patch, and just make hudi‘s behavior maybe more appropriate. \r\nIf I must point a downside, it maybe trouble users who are doing or and writing UTs for archival which need to take care of the min-instants/commits-retained even they disable auto clean :) Just nit patch here I had to say.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1001894159/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1001894512","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/4083#issuecomment-1001894512","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4083","id":1001894512,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM47t7Jw","user":{"login":"YannByron","id":10036681,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDM2Njgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10036681?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannByron","html_url":"https://github.com/YannByron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannByron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannByron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannByron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannByron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannByron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannByron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannByron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannByron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannByron/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-28T06:38:26Z","updated_at":"2021-12-28T06:40:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@dongkelun @xushiyan \r\nI'm sorry of not supporting this pr to solve the problems that `set the start query time of the table` and `query incrementally`.

We should support both.\r\n2. after adding `database` config, no matter get the `database` value by using a individual config like `hoodie.datasource.write.database.name` or parsing from the existing `hoodie.datasource.write.table.name`/`hoodie.table.name` when enable `hoodie.sql.uses.database.table.name`, we'll have four related options: `hoodie.datasource.hive_sync.table`, `hoodie.datasource.hive_sync.database` and the two mentioned above.

I think putting this conditional validity could compromise the integrity of min-instant as user can toggle auto clean any time.

Some points we should think about:\r\n> \r\n> 1. as this pr, just work for spark-sql. What about Spark DataFrame Write? We should support both.\r\n> 2. after adding `database` config, no matter get the `database` value by using a individual config like `hoodie.datasource.write.database.name` or parsing from the existing `hoodie.datasource.write.table.name`/`hoodie.table.name` when enable `hoodie.sql.uses.database.table.name`, we'll have four related options: `hoodie.datasource.hive_sync.table`, `hoodie.datasource.hive_sync.database` and the two mentioned above. Then, user have to learn these. Can we combine and simplify these?\r\n> \r\n> IMO, Hudi with a mountain of configs already has a high threshold of use. We should choose some solutions which balance the functionality and use experience as far as possible.\r\n\r\n@YannByron  Hello\r\n1、About Spark DataFrame Write, we can use ` hoodie.table.name ` to specify the table name\r\n2、Because the database name can be specified when creating tables in Spark SQL, it is not through ` hoodie.database.name` \r\n and other configurations are specified. I think ` hoodie.sql.use.database.table.name `  is just a switch to judge whether SQL needs to be given ` hoodie.table.name`  specify the database name. It does not conflict with other configurations\r\nAs for combine other duplicate configuration items, I think we can solve them in other separate PR\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1001969965/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1001981031","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/4346#issuecomment-1001981031","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4346","id":1001981031,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM47uQRn","user":{"login":"zhangyue19921010","id":69956021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5OTU2MDIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69956021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010","html_url":"https://github.com/zhangyue19921010","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-28T10:06:01Z","updated_at":"2021-12-28T10:06:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks a lot for your attention @yihua and @vinothchandar.

We can add configs `hoodie.datasource.write.database.name` in `DataSourceWriteOptions` and `hoodie.database.name` in `HoodieTableConfig`. And if `database.name` provided, we joint the `database.name` and `table.name` and pass it to `readStartCommitTime`. And then, use can set `hoodie.dbName.tableName.consume.start.timestamp` in hive and query.\r\n> \r\n> Also, `hoodie.datasource.write.database.name` and `hoodie.database.name` can reuse in other scene.\r\n> \r\n> @xushiyan what do you think.\r\n\r\n@xushiyan @YannByron   I probably understand the solution. \r\n\r\nSQL will persist the database name to ` hoodie.properties` by default, DF is selectively persisted through optional database parameters. Then, in incremental query, if  set ` databaseName.tableName`, we match `databaseName.tableName`. If it is inconsistent or there is no databaseName, incremental query will not be performed. If consistent, perform an incremental query.If the incremental query does not have a database name set, does not match the database name, only the table name\r\n\r\nSo, which parameter should DF use to persist the database name？","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1002442373/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1002462150","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/4461#issuecomment-1002462150","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4461","id":1002462150,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM47wFvG","user":{"login":"xushiyan","id":2701446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDE0NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2701446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan","html_url":"https://github.com/xushiyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-29T08:41:02Z","updated_at":"2021-12-29T08:41:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@nikenfls pls let us know if it gets resolved.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1002462150/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1002566382","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/4311#issuecomment-1002566382","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4311","id":1002566382,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM47wfLu","user":{"login":"sunilknataraj","id":53898937,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzODk4OTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53898937?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunilknataraj","html_url":"https://github.com/sunilknataraj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunilknataraj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunilknataraj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunilknataraj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunilknataraj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunilknataraj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunilknataraj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunilknataraj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunilknataraj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunilknataraj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-29T12:16:11Z","updated_at":"2021-12-29T12:16:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Myself and John belong to same company and talking about same issue.
