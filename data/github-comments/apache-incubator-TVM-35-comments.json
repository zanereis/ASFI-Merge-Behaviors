We (@yidawang @yzhliu ) also thought about @tqchen 's solution. It's a very nice and generic approach. But we think it is also helpful to keep another hierarchy for optimization and deployment on different devices. I agree that dividing into modules may lead to multiple outputs sometimes. But we could provide some wrapper to make the process of module build and deployment transparent to user.  We may currently still stick to our method.

The first task is to compile part of a graph for a particular device.

Without partitioning, graph-level scheduling search can be difficult.\r\nThe second task is to execute the graph.

Also, caffe is so lightweighted that we simply feeds abstracted networks data into underlying device driver without any optimization that TVM does. The driver itself handles optimization, compiling, running.\r\n\r\nMy point is, when we are talking about something like interface or heterogeneous, the abstracted description passed from *high level* to *low level* should be self-contained, which means that when you passing a *so-called* subgraph (or context keyword you like), the subgraph information should be no more no less - it just like another network (regardless the purpose of it). This is just like you are running a single graph context on one device. The interface is so important that it will impact all backend drivers. It will be pretty weird for a device driver knows that it has a big graph, but it should only execute part of the graph. You guys can look into Android Neural Networks API (check [`partitionTheWork`](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/ml/+/android-p-preview-4/nn/runtime/ExecutionPlan.cpp#771)) which aims only to abstract backend devices.\r\n\r\nSo, i vote for @zhiics (though i have contributed nothing to tvm...)

I know exactly that TVM aims to provide generic optimization regardless the backend device, and I was very excited when I got to read TVM paper. However, when it comes to practice, especially in context of this *heterogeneous execution* issue, the primitives of the backend is mostly inconsistent across different devices. What I am trying to say is that, yes we can optimize IRs that finally feed to LLVM-like backend which happily takes these IR; but regarding accelerators, a driver is usually provided by the accelerator vendor - the primitives of the driver could be very high level such as Conv2D. I am new to TVM, but intuitionally, the IR (output of the optimization) could be of lower level than Conv2D like primitives. If that's going to be the case, the graph which is composed by operators and tensors should feed to accelerator driver directly - before the IR optimization which is of lower level.\r\n\r\n@junrushao1994 If we take neural networks as *program*, yes I am referring to something like program slicing.\r\n\r\n![tvm stack](https://tvm.ai/images/release/end_to_end_stack.png)\r\n\r\nI will quote the TVM stack to make my point clear. Basically we have different categories of backend devices (for intuition only):\r\n* high level primitives: cuDNN, mklDNN, clDNN like drivers, and accelerator drivers\r\n* mid-level primitives: CUDA, OpenCL like libraries\r\n* low-level primitives: LLVM with x86, ARM as devices\r\nI guess the generic optimization is able to handle mid-level and low-level primitives. But for high level, the dedicated drivers know much better how to optimize or schedule.\r\n\r\nHowever, this issue depends on what TVM is intended to be. If TVM is going to support only one (or very limited) non-CPU backend devices when executing one given networks, I think a context based approach is cool - we only need to fallback to CPU. Otherwise, if TVM aims to schedule ONE network (divided into sub-networks) across different devices, I guess the subgraph approach? The answer is really deeply tighten with TVM's path. There is no better or worse, there will only be the more suitable. If the decision is that TVM is going to supported only limited devices for a specific network running routine, @tqchen 's approach may come in charge. And, to be honest, though I am more likely to be interested in subgraph approach, I am still wondering that whether scheduling networks across devices is really a must in practice - first we don't have so many devices on one machine, second the memcpy could be heavy.\r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks you guys for be so patient as I really don't know much about TVM while still talking too much :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/406629081/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/406642411","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/1242#issuecomment-406642411","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1242","id":406642411,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNjY0MjQxMQ==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-20T15:51:26Z","updated_at":"2018-07-20T15:51:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"To be clear, the simple context-based approach works for multiple devices mentioned by @jackwish , including cases that do not fall back to CPU.

Device drivers don't need to know the *context semantic* as it receives a graph and execute it in the subgraph approach.\r\n\r\nA subgraph approach is not necessarily to have a recursion behavior. Say, we get a graph, we partition it into several subgraphs - the module, which holds subgraphs, is simply an executor. The master graph and subgraphs are described in the same way, and master graph doesn't knows there are many subgraphs. The executor has the executing context - there could be one subgraph or multiple subgraphs. For each subgraph, executor feeds to device driver *directly*.\r\n\r\nI am talking about how people stack software in a system. For both solutions, a layer that translates TVM's representation to driver representation is required (assume that the driver has generic NN interface that targets many frameworks and runtime). Context approach needs to translate context to *something like subgraph* and feeds the subgraph; subgraph approach feeds subgraph. See, the question is where you put the representation translation - delay it before drivers (context), or at early stage (subgraph). \r\n\r\nBtw, with respect, I am just making my point to be properly understood. Both are cool solutions.
