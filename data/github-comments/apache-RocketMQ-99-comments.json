rebalance。而rebalance会调用`updateProcessQueueTableInRebalance()`方法，该方法在判断`removeUnnecessaryMessageQueue()`时，对于broadcasting而言是会删除掉被断网的那台broker queue的消费进度。然后定时线程会把最新的消费进度刷到磁盘。当断网的broker网络恢复了之后，由于磁盘获取不到之前的消费进度，而将queue当成是新的来处理。从而导致了message的丢失。\r\n```\r\npublic long computePullFromWhere(MessageQueue mq) {\r\n        long result = -1;\r\n
