My understanding to API with `Async` suffix is those calls are executed separately asynchronously, e.g. `thenSupplyAsync`. But maybe combine is different as combine really means it needs to depends on previous stage. \r\n\r\nThanks for finding such subtle difference.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/718196438/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/718201756","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ratis/pull/236#issuecomment-718201756","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/236","id":718201756,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxODIwMTc1Ng==","user":{"login":"amaliujia","id":1938382,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzgzODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1938382?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia","html_url":"https://github.com/amaliujia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-28T20:52:10Z","updated_at":"2020-10-28T20:52:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Overall looks good to me","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/718201756/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/718274804","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ratis/pull/236#issuecomment-718274804","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/236","id":718274804,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxODI3NDgwNA==","user":{"login":"runzhiwang","id":51938049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxOTM4MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51938049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhiwang","html_url":"https://github.com/runzhiwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhiwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhiwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhiwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhiwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhiwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhiwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhiwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhiwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhiwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-28T23:57:31Z","updated_at":"2020-10-28T23:57:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/718274804/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/718274928","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ratis/pull/236#issuecomment-718274928","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/236","id":718274928,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxODI3NDkyOA==","user":{"login":"runzhiwang","id":51938049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxOTM4MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51938049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhiwang","html_url":"https://github.com/runzhiwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhiwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhiwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhiwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhiwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhiwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhiwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhiwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhiwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhiwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-28T23:58:01Z","updated_at":"2020-10-28T23:58:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@szetszwo Thanks the patch.
