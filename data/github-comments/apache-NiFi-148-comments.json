I took a closer look, and now realize I was mistaking this implementation, which acts as a server for the PullHttpChangeIngestor, with [the implementation on this branch](https://github.com/apache/nifi-minifi/tree/minifi-c2-server/minifi-c2), which was a WIP to update the server based on the aforementioned [C2 Protocol](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MINIFI/C2+Design).\r\n\r\nGiven that this updated minifi retains the Change Ingestor capabilities, I'm all for keeping the corresponding server, which I agree is useful. (Note - I'm still not sure how actively maintained/patched that server is, so users should be aware of that.)\r\n\r\nIn the future, I would be in favor of adding a Java client implementation of the [C2 Protocol](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MINIFI/C2+Design) in this project to be shared be nifi and minifi, which is compatible with the implememtation in `nifi-minifi-cpp`. We should also add a new C2 server implementation for this protocol which could be shared by nifi, minifi, and minifi-cpp, to align all these different flow runtime engines with the same C2 capabilities.\r\n\r\nThat should not be a consideration for this PR, merely something we could build upon this updated minifi. @mattyb149 - sorry for the back and forth on this, but if the plan is to sunset the nifi-minifi repository, then I do think we should retain that minifi-c2 module here, or else find another home for it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/808391298/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/808395966","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4933#issuecomment-808395966","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4933","id":808395966,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwODM5NTk2Ng==","user":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-26T17:28:55Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T17:28:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It would be nice if there was some write up about the state of the C2 across the projects so that this was more easily understood and tracked.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/808395966/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/808411977","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4933#issuecomment-808411977","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4933","id":808411977,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwODQxMTk3Nw==","user":{"login":"kevdoran","id":5102332,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMDIzMzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5102332?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevdoran","html_url":"https://github.com/kevdoran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevdoran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevdoran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevdoran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevdoran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevdoran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevdoran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevdoran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevdoran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevdoran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-26T17:56:13Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T19:52:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ottobackwards I wholeheartedly agree.

In NiFi, there is a shared thread pool for executing all processors' `onTrigger()` methods. If some processors held up execution threads, it could lead to starvation of other processors.\r\nI think a similar pattern could be used as in case of `ConsumeAzureEventHub`: start up the Worker at the first execution of `onTrigger()` and then just yield in the subsequent calls.\r\n\r\nI believe one Worker per processor should be enough and it is not necessary to maintain a pool of workers. A single Worker can run multiple threads for executing the Kinesis RecordProcessors. As far as I saw, the Worker spins up a thread for each assigned shard by default (RecordProcessor-xxxx threads). So the parallel processing is provided with one Worker too. The code is simpler in this way and there is less overhead at runtime (each Worker has its own \"maintenance\" threads like LeaseRenewer-xxxx, LeaseCoordinator-xxxx).\r\n\r\nThe processor cannot stop cleanly due to a bug in KCL. Interestingly, it has just been reported to AWS by someone else: https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/issues/796\r\nWhen the processor shuts down the Worker, the Worker leaves behind a thread running. Stopping/starting the processor multiple times would lead to thread leaking. Furthermore, the \"zombie\" thread(s) prevent NiFi to shut down properly:\r\n`2021-03-26 12:12:52,715 WARN [main] org.apache.nifi.bootstrap.Command NiFi has not finished shutting down after 20 seconds. Killing process.`\r\nFor this reason, I think we need to downgrade the KCL version to 1.13.3 until the bug is fixed.\r\n\r\nAnd an idea: the way the processor receives data via KCL is quite similar to other Consume*** processors (like the already mentioned `ConsumeAzureEventHub` or `ConsumeAMQP`), so I would consider to name the processor `ConsumeKinesisStream` instead of `Get~` (actually there is a Get-like/polling API for Kinesis too and another processor may be implemented later using that API).\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/808562542/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/808687351","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4822#issuecomment-808687351","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4822","id":808687351,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwODY4NzM1MQ==","user":{"login":"ChrisSamo632","id":12159006,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTU5MDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12159006?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632","html_url":"https://github.com/ChrisSamo632","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-27T08:11:32Z","updated_at":"2021-03-27T08:11:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@turcsanyip thanks for the comments.

Using KCL 1.13.3 instead of 1.14.x appears to be straight forward (i.e. no big API changes).\r\n\r\nThe refactoring to use a single Worker per processor and yield once the Worker has been setup looks fairly straight forward and I agree a simpler implementation *except* that if I am to follow the `ConsumeAzureEventHub` approach and use the `ProcessSessionFactory` version of `onTrigger`, I have to extend the `AbstractSessionFactoryProcessor` base class, but the existing AWS processors have a fairly long chain that extends from `AbstractProcessor` - I don't want to unmarry this processor from all the existing AWS processors and moving all AWS processors to use the different base class feels like a big change and not something we'd want to do.\r\n\r\nIs there a straight forward way around this do you think? OIne concern I had with the original implementation was the fact that I was holding on to a single `ProcessSession` and comitting it multiple times (i.e. after every set of messages had been processed by the KCL RecordProcessor) - using the ProcessSessionFactory approach to create a new session every time a new set of Kinesis messages are received would seem better... aside for the above issue of the different abstract processors.\r\n\r\nI'll look again at this further, but any guidance is welcome!\r\n\r\n\r\n@pvillard31 having looked again at the Record processing now I've the Azure processor to compare with, I think includiung them here should be fairly straight forward (famous last words)\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT: the Session Factory problem can be sorted by changing the base abstract AWS processor to extend `AbstractSessionFactoryProcessor` and copying the `AbstractProcessor` methods into there (but not making the overridden `onTrigger` method as `final`) - this retains the same functionality for most AWS processors but allows the `ConsumeKinesisStream` processor access to the `ProcessSessionFactory`. An akhenaten would be to remove the final modifier from the `AbstractProcessor` `onTrigger` that accepts the factory (but that impacts nearly all processors and the method is presumably `final` for good reason)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/808751275/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/809078554","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3213#issuecomment-809078554","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3213","id":809078554,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwOTA3ODU1NA==","user":{"login":"yoshiata","id":39290058,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjkwMDU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39290058?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yoshiata","html_url":"https://github.com/yoshiata","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yoshiata/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yoshiata/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yoshiata/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yoshiata/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yoshiata/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yoshiata/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yoshiata/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yoshiata/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yoshiata/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-29T05:31:08Z","updated_at":"2021-03-29T05:31:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tasanuma Thanks.

After reviewing the API documentation for `SimpleDateFormat` and `DateTimeFormatter` again in light of the Spark issue, it looks like another key difference is that `SimpleDateFormat` supports lowercase `z` as a General time zone reference, whereas `DateTimeFormatter` does not support it.  Implementing a unit test using the lowercase `z` as part of the parsing pattern should present the differences between the implementations.\r\n\r\nThanks for highlighting the issues you have uncovered @arkadius.  It would be great to find a way forward, unfortunately I'm not sure about the timeline for a new major release, or the best approach for now.  One option is providing a way to use this `DateTimeFormatter` approach as an optional feature.  This would require reworking the PR to implement new Evaluators, as opposed to changing the existing ones.  As far as how this could work, one approach might be a new `toDateTime()` function, which would avoid conflicting with the existing `toDate()` function.  This would allow users to migrate to the new implementation without breaking existing flows.
