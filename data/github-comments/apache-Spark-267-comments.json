For example, if the user does the following:\n\n```\nbin/spark-submit app.jar apparg1 -- apparg2\n```\n\nIt's impossible to know whether the application arguments are `apparg1 -- apparg2` or just `apparg1 apparg2`. Then it seems that `--` should always be used with `--primary`. Maybe we should make this point more explicit in the docs and error messages (i.e. don't only mention one or the other).\n\nHave you considered other alternatives for the name \"primary\"? It makes sense to us because we refer the user application jar / python file as the primary resource, but it may not make as much sense to the user, especially when they're just specifying 1 resource. At the same time I'm not sure if there is a better alternative. (I'm thinking about `--application-jar`, but that means we'll need something like `--application-file` for python.)

But that means `SparkSubmitArguments.primaryResource` can be `null`, and may potentially break many corner cases that rely on this assumption.

This patch converted a warning to a debug (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1208/files#diff-6b519cd0a9dc5b0ee9caab7712d252e9L238), I reverted that change.\n2. In this patch, `TestHive.scala` still used the old format (log.info), so I switched it to use the standard Spark format that includes guards (e.g. logInfo).\n3. I updated the title to reflect a new JIRA that more correctly describes the current approach.\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/commit/4c477117bb1ffef463776c86f925d35036f96b7a\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50974377/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50974423","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1513#issuecomment-50974423","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1513","id":50974423,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwOTc0NDIz","user":{"login":"tnachen","id":67244,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67244?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnachen","html_url":"https://github.com/tnachen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnachen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnachen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnachen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnachen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnachen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnachen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnachen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnachen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnachen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-02T21:09:45Z","updated_at":"2014-08-02T21:09:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I was considering a similar fix but I wasnt sure if computing all the class paths and options here where the task is submitted is safe versus in spark-class\nWhere the executor is running is safe.

If they pass it to `--jars`, then now they have to worry about the ordering of the jars, because the first one will be parsed as the application jar. I think it should just be an argument by itself as it is today.\n\nInstead, I propose that we rename `--` to something more specific to Spark, such as `--spark-application-args`, such that everything that follows will be interpreted as application args. This essentially reduces the namespace of collision to the single config that we introduce in this PR (`--` or `--spark-application-args` or some better name).\n\n```\nbin/spark-submit\n  spark-internal\n  --class [...].HiveThriftServer2\n  --master local[*]\n  --spark-application-args --master something --hiveconf k=v\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50975678/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50975715","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1741#issuecomment-50975715","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1741","id":50975715,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwOTc1NzE1","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-02T21:59:18Z","updated_at":"2014-08-02T21:59:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA tests have started for PR 1741.
