It was created to track the fact we needed to examine our usage of a HashSet there, since we ran into problems with the over-allocation of a hash set (eg., 64 slots to hold 23 items, etc.). When we have 1000 of these in memory at a time, the over-allocation starts to hurt.\n\nUpon further scrutiny, those `WindowedValues` should only be getting turned into a `Set` when we need to do `equals` or `hashCode`, to make sure we get an order-independent comparison. Assuming this is limited to tests, we can probably resolve the Jira issue as won't fix.\n\n## \n\nWhat follows is more detail about the solution we had in mind when we created the Jira ticket:\n\nIn general, an array-based `Set` can be more efficient for small numbers of elements when the equality comparison is cheap enough. It also definitely has better memory usage, since most hash tables will be over-allocated to prevent collisions.\n\nIn this case case we know the following properties about window sets:\n1. We don't call `contains` on these sets.\n2. These sets tend to be small (~30 elements at most)\n3. The only reason we turn them into sets is to get order-independent `equals` and `hashCode`.\n4. These sets were already de-duplicated before serialiazation. Further, since we don't create the set until calling hashCode or equality, the outside world doesn't care whether the representation is a Set or not.\n\nGiven this isn't likely on the hot-path, it may be reasonable to close the Jira ticket as \"won't fix\". If we want to keep it around, another option is to implement the `Set` as follows:\n1. Implement the `Set` interface, using a backing collection which has the values sorted by their `hashCode`.\n2. Use this collection to implement `hashCode` and `equals`. Resolve \"collisions\" by a linear scan over all elements with equal `hashCode` (similar to chaining or linear probing).\n\nNote that this data structure is essentially a hash table where we've collapsed the table into a list.\n\nThis would have 0-additional memory overhead and it would support linear time `equals` and `hashCode`. It could throw `UnsupportedOperationException` for insert/contains or implement them using a binary-search on the `hashCode` and then a linear scan over items with equal `hashCode`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/196957373/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/196959894","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/11#issuecomment-196959894","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/11","id":196959894,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5Njk1OTg5NA==","user":{"login":"dhalperi","id":526415,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNjQxNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/526415?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi","html_url":"https://github.com/dhalperi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-15T18:22:21Z","updated_at":"2016-03-15T18:22:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bjchambers did you LGTM this?
