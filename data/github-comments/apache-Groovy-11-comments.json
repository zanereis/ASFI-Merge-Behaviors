I considered the throwing of a CCE a glitch, meaning un undesired undocumented leaking Exception that confronts Users with the internals of Groovy.\n\nThis test code shows the problem:\n\n```\nshouldFail(ClassCastException) {\n        compareTo(1, \"22\")\n}\n```\n\nThe question here is whether Groovy as a language **wants** to throw a CCE when the user tries to compare a number and that String, or whether Groovy wants to throw a GRE, as it does for several other error cases. The problem is that the user does not know or care about types he passes to compareTo(), since compareTo is so mighty flexible in comparing apples and oranges in many cases. A CCE should possibly only be thrown if the documentation clearly states that a cast will happen, of that such an Exception will be thrown. Also a CCE may look like a Groovy bug to many users (missing instanceof check before a cast, bad type handling). A GRE looks more like intended behavior.\n\nI think I presumed that the original author of the code had overseen the possibility of a CCE here and did not wrap it out of oversight.\n\nI am somewhat dispassionate about keeping the CCE or using a GRE in the future. I believe semantically the CCE is not desirable for users, both in terms of the message and in terms of the exception type. But I may be wrong, users might actually want to compare all items in a set to check that they are compareTo() compatible, and rely on the CCE to detect pairs that are not compatible.\n\nSo with that explanation, I'll let you decide.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/234908405/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/234910282","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/150#issuecomment-234910282","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/150","id":234910282,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNDkxMDI4Mg==","user":{"login":"tkruse","id":1525116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjUxMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1525116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse","html_url":"https://github.com/tkruse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-25T09:51:53Z","updated_at":"2016-07-25T09:52:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"for

In particular, I want to have a job runner which executes scripts loaded dynamically; the job runner should provide Groovy on classpath and provide a clean execution slate to each script as it comes in, for statelessness.\n\nThinking back to this bug, it seems like the current way metaclass is implemented will cause any metaclass modifications in the script to \"build up\" over time, particularly modifications to base classes. Is this intended, that changing a metaclass constitutes \"static state\" from Groovy's perspective? Or could we have the notion of a GroovyRuntime instance encapsulating state for execution of one (or more related) scripts, but which can be swapped for a new, fresh instance when desired.\n\nNot sure which way to go makes more sense, but would be interested in a word from Groovy expert folks about whether metaclass manipulation is considered \"permanent static modification\" or \"contextual static modification\", with replaceable context. Maybe we could support both in a Groovy 3.0? 😛 \n\nEDIT: There's also an element of thread-safety here, which adds to what I'm thinking about. Currently, if I understand correctly, metaclass modifications are visible across threads, causing (potentially unexpected) behavior. If that is the case, I'm OK with the fix as is (default weak metaclass) and recommending my users to avoid all metaclass manipulation, but want to make sure I'm understanding this correctly.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/235152985/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/235204160","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/366#issuecomment-235204160","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/366","id":235204160,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNTIwNDE2MA==","user":{"login":"paulk-asert","id":280016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MDAxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/280016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert","html_url":"https://github.com/paulk-asert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-26T08:58:41Z","updated_at":"2016-07-26T08:58:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I removed the slightly flawed attempts at synchronization and adopted a more Java behavior when calling next by throwing a NoSuchElementException once a NumberRange iterator is exhausted.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/235204160/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/235209910","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/373#issuecomment-235209910","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/373","id":235209910,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNTIwOTkxMA==","user":{"login":"paulk-asert","id":280016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MDAxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/280016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert","html_url":"https://github.com/paulk-asert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-26T09:18:19Z","updated_at":"2016-07-26T09:19:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"For failing tests which are supposed to pass, the general pattern is to use `GroovyTestCase#notYetImplemented` method or the `@NotYetImplemented` annotation and leave `shouldCompile` in the test itself.

is your issue with `Eval` or more generally `GroovyShell`?\n\nMy hesitation with this as it is now is as Jochen pointed out, this doesn't handle scripts that contain class definitions so is not really a good fix, just a bandaid.  Also, I need to do more testing but this may cause problems if metaclasses are touched in the scripts.  I think it would be safe to do this in `Eval` since it doesn't save the shell between invocations, so eval can grab the shell's `GroovyClassLoader` and flush the caches for all the loaded classes.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/244420047/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/244630028","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/413#issuecomment-244630028","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/413","id":244630028,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NDYzMDAyOA==","user":{"login":"paulk-asert","id":280016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MDAxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/280016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert","html_url":"https://github.com/paulk-asert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-04T21:32:14Z","updated_at":"2016-09-04T21:32:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/244630028/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/244654667","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/413#issuecomment-244654667","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/413","id":244654667,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NDY1NDY2Nw==","user":{"login":"keeganwitt","id":64612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keeganwitt","html_url":"https://github.com/keeganwitt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keeganwitt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keeganwitt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keeganwitt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keeganwitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keeganwitt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keeganwitt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keeganwitt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keeganwitt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keeganwitt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-05T04:01:21Z","updated_at":"2016-09-05T04:01:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Any suggestions for debugging Travis failure?
