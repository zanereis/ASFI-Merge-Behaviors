However, I can only check the ClosedChannelException with instance of :( because the  consumer.send(req); is throwing it as a runtime exception. Would this be ok for you? then I do there the validation as you suggested and throw an illegal argument if all the servers are invalid. \n\nAlthough this would complicate the exception logic code. If you think that this situation does not occur that often, that the users misconfigure all of the boostrap servers and that the logging info it's enough, we can of course close the merge request.

I was initially thinking we could just include a custom version of the `MiniKDC` dependency in the Flink code. As you pointed out, this is not possible because the problem lies in the `SecureDataNodeStarter` which returns the secure resources. This class is part of `hadoop-hdfs`which we can't include a custom version because it depends on the Hadoop version provided during build time.\n\nOnce the patch is out, we can run this test in a special profile where we set the Hadoop version which supports non-privileged ports. As of now, I don't see a feasible solution other than skipping this test.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/243457232/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/243457548","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2275#issuecomment-243457548","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2275","id":243457548,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MzQ1NzU0OA==","user":{"login":"mxm","id":837221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNzIyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/837221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm","html_url":"https://github.com/mxm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-30T14:28:36Z","updated_at":"2016-08-30T14:28:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Could you please rebase to the latest master and remove any merge commits?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/243457548/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/243471753","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2432#issuecomment-243471753","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2432","id":243471753,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MzQ3MTc1Mw==","user":{"login":"rmetzger","id":89049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger","html_url":"https://github.com/rmetzger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-30T15:07:45Z","updated_at":"2016-08-30T15:07:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/243471753/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/243484385","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2432#issuecomment-243484385","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2432","id":243484385,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MzQ4NDM4NQ==","user":{"login":"tzulitai","id":5284370,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODQzNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5284370?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai","html_url":"https://github.com/tzulitai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-30T15:44:58Z","updated_at":"2016-08-30T15:44:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the confirmation.\nThe build will probably fail again due to an unused import: https://travis-ci.org/tzulitai/flink/jobs/156191304, which was just hotfixed, so we need to rebase again.
