The failure is not related to this unit test because the following unit tests are passed well until the failure point. \n\n```\nTests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 18.096 sec - in org.apache.tajo.ha.TestHAServiceHDFSImpl\n```\n\nAccording to logs, the failure seems to be caused by HDFS mini cluster, which occurs occasionally. Anyway, I trigger the TravisCI.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/71713607/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/71766970","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/358#issuecomment-71766970","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/358","id":71766970,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxNzY2OTcw","user":{"login":"blrunner","id":3724310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MjQzMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3724310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner","html_url":"https://github.com/blrunner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-28T01:49:01Z","updated_at":"2015-01-28T01:49:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1\n\nI

First, disabled nagle algorithm as possible. Enabling nagle algorithm will reduce the resource use on network infrastructure, but it will delay network transmission. Also, netty4 team recommend not to use flush() function frequently, but it also delays the network transmission. Second, I have set the send and receive buffer size of servers and clients as possible. Low buffer size also delays the network performance, and providers and consumers wait until the buffer is empty. Finally, I have merged and refactored the source code to use shared eventloopgroup.

Your workaround code seems to try to firstly find the order of joins whose join types is same. In my opinion, this approach may miss some of join order combinations.
