I also modified `_init_iter()`, adding extra checks. Hope my modification to the code is ok. I have tested in various cases using `fit()` and `predict()`, and the results are normal.\n\nTo make sure I didn't do anything unexpected, I will briefly list what I did to my fork and this PR:\n1. Make a fork and clone a local copy.\n2. Add `_init_eval_iter()` and then docstring. (2 commits)\n3. Try to rebase the last 2 commits. Fail to push to Github.\n4. Use `pull` to update the local copy and push again. Succeed.\n5. Push the \"Update branch\" bottom on this PR page. (5 commits appear!)\n6. Fail to rebase in various ways. Use `git reset --hard HEAD~3`.\n7. Edit `model.py` as @tqchen and @antinucleon suggested.\n8. Test modified code in various cases.\n9. `git add -A` and `git commit -m \"<Message...>\"`.\n10. Fail to `push` so use `git push --force`.\n11. Wait for the travis to finish.\n\nIt seems that neither of `git reset --hard` and `git push --force` is suggested, and I am not sure whether or not my operation will have some unexpected effect.\n\nIf there are any problems with my code, I will try to fix it soon.\n\nBTW, I think the right thing to do is that I wait for this PR to be done before I use `pull` or \"Update branch\" to keep my fork synced and don't push other commits (or I will need to start a new branch). And after the PR is done, I can merge the corresponding branch with, say, a \"master\" branch. Am I right?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/148795219/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/148796935","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/278#issuecomment-148796935","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/278","id":148796935,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0ODc5NjkzNQ==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-16T18:32:23Z","updated_at":"2015-10-16T18:32:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@II-Matto It is fine to git push --force to your own fork, As long as the changes are only yours.

Thanks! This is very considerate.\n\nSince this is the first time I participate in an open source projects, what I really wanted to know, at the very beginning, is the right operations and steps. I had no idea what I needed to know at first, and even didn't know what to search for. After this pull request was finished, I did some googling, and found this blog post very useful: https://gun.io/blog/how-to-github-fork-branch-and-pull-request/ (Unfortunately, this seems to be outiside GFW. A Bing cached page may help in some cases.).\n\n[This blog post](https://gun.io/blog/how-to-github-fork-branch-and-pull-request/) lists the necessary steps (with some of my personal addition):\n1. **Check out the \"Network\" graph** , e.g. https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/network. It is also necessary to check out existing issues and pull requests.\n2. **Open an issue for discussion**.\n3. **Make a fork**. See https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/.\n4. **Clone the fork** to get a local working copy.\n5. **Add upstream** to get synced with the original repository.\n6. **Setup a development branch**. I guess it is a good idea to use a new branch for each new feature or fix, since \"you can only have one Pull Request per branch\".\n7. **Do the development**. Maybe you will commit crazily to the development branch. Also, don't forget to discuss with others.\n8 **Squash commits**, i.e. merge small and unnecessary commit pieces into larger and meaningful commits.\n9. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**, discuss, fix problems, etc. Work with other contributors to finally make a good patch.\n10. Wait for the owner to merge or reject the PR.\n11. Done!\n12. Maybe merge the development branch to the forked master branch, and start new branch for new features.\n\nI am not sure whether new commits will keep appearing in a pull request after it is merged, or merging the development branch with the forked master branch will ever effect the corresponding pull request.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/148887362/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/148887589","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/278#issuecomment-148887589","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/278","id":148887589,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0ODg4NzU4OQ==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-17T05:48:07Z","updated_at":"2015-10-17T05:48:07Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"If you like to share your experience and contribute to the  https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/master/doc/contribute.md  to make others to get started more easily\n\nIt is more than welcomed :) Thanks for the contribution\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/148887589/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/148887719","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/278#issuecomment-148887719","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/278","id":148887719,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0ODg4NzcxOQ==","user":{"login":"II-Matto","id":2261229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjEyMjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2261229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/II-Matto","html_url":"https://github.com/II-Matto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/II-Matto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/II-Matto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/II-Matto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/II-Matto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/II-Matto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/II-Matto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/II-Matto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/II-Matto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/II-Matto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-17T05:53:29Z","updated_at":"2015-10-17T05:53:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tqchen I will do that after I perform some experiments to confirm the right thing to do.

It is more natural for R/Julia (and potentially matlab) users to think in that way. And it cause less confusion when working with language's native Array types. \n\nThere is caveat though: the API needs to be careful when passing parameters back to libmxnet. Currently what MXNet.jl does is to assume all parameters of type `Tuple{N,Int}` should be shape, and it gets reversed before dumping into string (primarily when constructing new `Symbol` or `DataIter`). The assumption is definitely not true but at least up to now seems valid.

In general, the prediction could be any ND tensor, and label will be a tensor with corresponding shape, except one of the dimension is a singleton dimension (of size 1).

So @tornadomeet if you are working in segmentation you could probably add this.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/149548871/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/149554159","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/337#issuecomment-149554159","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/337","id":149554159,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0OTU1NDE1OQ==","user":{"login":"pluskid","id":3542,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3542?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid","html_url":"https://github.com/pluskid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-20T12:46:31Z","updated_at":"2015-10-20T12:49:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"BTW: just as a side comment since our current `Softmax` operator is being discussed. It is a bit confusing at first when I was using the `Softmax` operator. The `forward` operation behave exactly like a softmax, but in the backward operation, it becomes a _softmax with multiclass logistic loss_. I guess this might be due to efficiency consideration or code re-use, but it leads to some inconvenience / inconsistency.\n- The `Softmax` operator needs both `data` and `label` as arguments, though if people only do prediction, only the `data` is needed.\n- There is no objective function value of the logistic loss computed. Though it does not really affect the learning, and especially we are running for a fixed number of iterations, we do not need to rely on it for stop condition, either. But the correct objective function value serves important role for debugging. For example, when researcher are writing their own layers or new optimizers, looking at how the objective function changing at a finer scale might be very helpful for testing whether it is implemented correctly, and if not where might be some issues.\n- People might need to use some other losses on top of the `Softmax` probabilistic output. Caffe / Mocha.jl currently have a `Softmax` layer that does just softmax, and then a `SoftmaxLoss` layer which combines softmax and logistic loss. I think this might be a viable alternative way.\n\nThe followings are just some minor thoughts on the general design:\n- Currently the `label` arguments for `Softmax` is an `implicit` arguments. If I understand correctly, there is no way to (like `data`) construct a `Variable` as the `label` and compose them like this\n\n```\ndata = mx.symbol.Variable('data-foo')\nlabel = mx.symbol.Variable('label-foo')\nnet = mx.symbol.Softmax(data=data, label=label, name='out')\n```\n\nThis essentially allows us to _rename_ the label variable to whatever we want, as in the `data` case. Then when the user construct `DataIter`, he/she can specify what names (`data-foo` and `label-foo` in this case) the `DataIter` is providing (this is also the current design used in MXNet.jl). So when we train the network with this `DataIter` we actually knows which ones are data which ones are labels. The current way (automatically deciding based on a `data` or `label` postfix) is nice, but it might get confused to figure out the exact correspondence in multiple-input multiple-output case (RNN case, not image segmentation case). \n- Since the loss functions are only used during training, we might use the following convention: when defining the architecture, the user only defines the network up to the output layer. A loss layer is provided when the user calls `fit`, and the network is composed with the loss criterion on the fly. But otherwise, the loss is not a part of the architecture and the semantic for doing `predict` with the network is clearer. For example, [Lasagne](http://lasagne.readthedocs.org/en/latest/), a light-weighted framework based on Theano has this design.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/149554159/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/149570893","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/287#issuecomment-149570893","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/287","id":149570893,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0OTU3MDg5Mw==","user":{"login":"thirdwing","id":1547093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDcwOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1547093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing","html_url":"https://github.com/thirdwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-20T13:38:53Z","updated_at":"2015-10-20T13:38:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I will test the R package using your dll right now.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/149570893/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/149585533","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/336#issuecomment-149585533","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/336","id":149585533,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0OTU4NTUzMw==","user":{"login":"pluskid","id":3542,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3542?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid","html_url":"https://github.com/pluskid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-20T14:32:20Z","updated_at":"2015-10-20T14:32:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"If necessary, the numpy.transpose function could be called.
