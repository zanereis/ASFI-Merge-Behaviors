segment id, not using whole interval. Currently it's not accepting paging spec but we can support that with some more works, I believe. This process even can be automated in druid broker, that we are testing on select query with union datasource.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/236760601/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/236764884","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/3269#issuecomment-236764884","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3269","id":236764884,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNjc2NDg4NA==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-02T01:28:17Z","updated_at":"2016-08-02T01:28:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"👍 \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/236764884/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/236765205","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/3269#issuecomment-236765205","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3269","id":236765205,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNjc2NTIwNQ==","user":{"login":"fjy","id":428325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODMyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy","html_url":"https://github.com/fjy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-02T01:30:22Z","updated_at":"2016-08-02T01:30:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"👍 \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/236765205/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/236766447","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/3297#issuecomment-236766447","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3297","id":236766447,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNjc2NjQ0Nw==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-02T01:37:36Z","updated_at":"2016-08-02T01:37:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@KenjiTakahashi Honestly I'm thinking more about the case where you don't care about ordering or necessarily want a threshold – when you're trying to pull out some (or even all) data matching a filter in whatever order you get it.

the time columns from all applicable partitions first – to figure out which rows you're going to include – and then once you've picked the rows, read all the other

@kaijianding for posting this!\n\nTo me, the differences (result format, lack of ordering, different processing style) are substantial enough that this should be a different query type from select.\n\nwe might also want to:\n- Remove the dimension/metric distinction, so the user can just ask for \"columns\". The dimension/metric split really only makes sense if we're aggregating, and Scan does not aggregate. The return format could be dictated either by the underlying column type and possibly overridden by a hint provided by the user. I'm not sure if we need to support extractionFns, but if we do, they could be provided explicitly instead of as part of DimensionSpecs. (that way, they'd even work on non-string columns!)\n- Maybe or maybe not keep \"granularity\", although if we do keep it, I think we shouldn't pass it to `makeCursors`. I think we only need to use it to truncate timestamps in the returned rows, and if so then splitting up the cursors by granularity bucket is extra overhead.\n- Would be nice to do what we need to do (if anything) to enable a future format change for the batches from JSON/Smile arrays into column-oriented binary form like Arrow or ValueVector. It'd be great if a future patch could change that for Scan through just a header or a flag on the query.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/237303827/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/237326922","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/3314#issuecomment-237326922","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3314","id":237326922,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNzMyNjkyMg==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-03T18:30:16Z","updated_at":"2016-08-03T18:30:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@drcrallen

If we don't care about ordering then it would indeed work. Maybe in specific cases it would be possible to store data in a way that comes out as \"pre-sorted\", given that we know in what order partitions will be read. Or, if the data is partitioned on dimension, maybe use the method @navis proposed to \"cut\" `threshold/num_of_partitions` items from each partition and merge client-side.\n\nI'm afraid that reading time from everything would still take significant amount of time.
