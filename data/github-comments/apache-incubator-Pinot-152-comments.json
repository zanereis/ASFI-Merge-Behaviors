Maybe this can be a newbie task?\r\n\r\nUntil then, I am tempted to say keep the logs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1247288563/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1247311596","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/9377#issuecomment-1247311596","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/9377","id":1247311596,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5KWHbs","user":{"login":"sajjad-moradi","id":8548220,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1NDgyMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8548220?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sajjad-moradi","html_url":"https://github.com/sajjad-moradi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sajjad-moradi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sajjad-moradi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sajjad-moradi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sajjad-moradi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sajjad-moradi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sajjad-moradi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sajjad-moradi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sajjad-moradi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sajjad-moradi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-14T21:16:57Z","updated_at":"2022-09-14T21:16:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> > This PR only handles segment generation part.

I think we can use the table name as the group id and prefix it with `stream-level` or `partition-level` based on the consumption model used. For existing applications that may rely on an empty string group id, they can always add a table config to override the `group.id` kafka consumer property.

If yes, can you link it to the description section of this PR?\r\n> \r\n> We might need to carefully monitor the deployment in order to detect any existing use cases once this PR is merged.\r\n\r\nyes I was suggesting either a release note or a backward incompatible section in the PR but also in Pinot doc. \r\n\r\nIn terms of the rationale, AFAIK, \r\n- nothing should be implicitly cast in logical plan. what we do NOW is b/c:\r\n  - if a function expects `foo(int, long)` then they data type should be exact\r\n  - however many system implements overload `foo(int, int), foo(int, long), foo(long, long) ...` so it will always find one properly. Pinot doesn't support these type of operator/function overloading thus we need to provide implicit cast.\r\n\r\n- many logical planner insert explicit CAST operator if the type doesn't match in user's provided SQL, for example:\r\n  - `SELECT intCol + strCol FROM tbl` will result in a \r\n```\r\nLogicalProject(\r\n  [+(intCol, CAST(strCol, INT))], \r\n  LogicalScan(\r\n    tbl, \r\n    [intCol, strCol]\r\n  )\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nso IMO as long as we state clearly in our user-facing implicit cast rule in doc we are good. I am incline to the following:\r\n- all numeric should have implicit cast and (1) throw exception (2) put MAX/MIN_VAL, or NaN when overflow\r\n- all DataType sharing the same StorageType should be able to implicitly cast between (for example JSON / STRING)\r\n- all other should not have default implicit cast rule\r\n- \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1247391278/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1247415824","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/9385#issuecomment-1247415824","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/9385","id":1247415824,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5KWg4Q","user":{"login":"Jackie-Jiang","id":17555551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTU1NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17555551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang","html_url":"https://github.com/Jackie-Jiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-15T00:01:02Z","updated_at":"2022-09-15T00:01:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@walterddr @jackjlli Seems different DB have different implicit conversion behavior between number and string:\r\nPresto: not allow - https://prestodb.io/docs/current/functions/conversion.html\r\nMySQL: allow - https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/type-conversion.html\r\nSQL Server: allow - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/data-types/data-type-conversion-database-engine?view=sql-server-ver16\r\n\r\nLet me see if we can support it without paying too much overhead","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1247415824/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1247417085","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/9397#issuecomment-1247417085","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/9397","id":1247417085,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5KWhL9","user":{"login":"61yao","id":111319704,"node_id":"U_kgDOBqKamA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/111319704?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/61yao","html_url":"https://github.com/61yao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/61yao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/61yao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/61yao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/61yao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/61yao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/61yao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/61yao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/61yao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/61yao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-15T00:03:08Z","updated_at":"2022-09-15T00:03:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> This one relies on #9389.

Kafka allows keyed records and additionally, provides headers\r\n> 2. Kinesis requires keyed records and includes some additional metadata such as sequenceId etc\r\n> 3. Pulsar also supports keyed records and allows including arbitrary properties.\r\n> 4. Pubsub supports keyed messages, along with user-defined attributes and message metadata.\r\n> \r\n> Today, Pinot drops everything from the payload, other than the record value itself. Hence, there needs to be a way to extract these values and present them in the Pinot table as regular columns (of course, it has to be defined in the pinot schema).\r\n> \r\n> This can be very useful for the Pinot user as they don't have to \"pre-process\" the stream to make the record metadata available in the data payload. It also prevents custom solutions (such as [this](https://github.com/startreedata/startree-pinot/pull/484/files)).\r\n> \r\n> # Context\r\n> Want to clarify the terminology here. Typically, in most streaming systems, a record is composed of the following:\r\n> \r\n> 1. Record key - usually, a string, although kafka allows any type (today, `pinot-kafka` connector assumes the key to always be a key)\r\n> 2. Record value - actual data paylaod. Pinot extract only this value and decodes it.\r\n> 3. Record headers - these are user-defined record header that can be specific to the publishing application. Typically, headers are meant to be efficient and small. For example, in Kafka , it allows <String, byte[]>. technically, `byte[]` can be anything and we can make a call on whether to support arbitrary header value types or not.\r\n> 4. Record Metadata - these may or may not be included in the record payload and it is system-defined. For example, for message identifiers, kinesis has `sequenceId`, kafka has `offset`, pubsub has `messageId` etc. While these may not be useful for the user-facing application, it comes-in handy for debugging.\r\n> \r\n> # What does this PR do?\r\n> This PR attempts to extract key, header and other metadata from any supported streaming connector. This feature is opt-in, meaning it can be enabled by setting `stream.$streamType.metadata.populate` as `true`\r\n> \r\n> please note:\r\n> \r\n> 1. I am in the process of adding some unit tests. I have tested with a pinot realtime quickstart. Need to do some more cleanup.\r\n> 2. For whatever reason, the integration tests fail in the CI pipeline here, where as it runs fine on my laptop. Still fixing forward.\r\n> 3. Documentation for this feature will follow after this PR is merged.\r\n> \r\n> For Reviewers, things to discuss:\r\n> \r\n> 1. In the current patch, the record key (when available) is extracted as `__key` column , where as headers are extracted as `header$<HEADER_KEY_NAME>` . Does this sound like a good convention to follow for all stream connectors  -> Header columns will always be prefixed with `header$` and any other metadata such as key or offset will be prefixed as `__`\r\n> 2. In `MessageBatch`, I have marked one of the methods as `@Deprecated` as I am hoping to eventually eliminate the need for typed interface there. The current changes are backwards compatible. Let me know if there is a better way.\r\n\r\nWould prefer if we're able to keep it all consistent in terms of the prefix (if going with __, then __key, __header$headerName, __metadata)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1247456006/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1247460782","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/9390#issuecomment-1247460782","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/9390","id":1247460782,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5KWr2u","user":{"login":"antwigambrah","id":12635930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjM1OTMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12635930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/antwigambrah","html_url":"https://github.com/antwigambrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antwigambrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antwigambrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antwigambrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antwigambrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antwigambrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antwigambrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antwigambrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antwigambrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antwigambrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-15T01:20:51Z","updated_at":"2022-09-15T01:20:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> QuickStartBase\r\n\r\nGreat .

As far as updating the timestamps in metadata is concerned, we need to find a way for users to specify the correct time-formats. The issue is we don't allow backward-incompatible change in the schema so if an user fixes the segment metadata timestamp via some new API, we won't be able to reflect those changes in the schema. This inconsistency may break a lot of things.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1248110433/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1248117288","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/9402#issuecomment-1248117288","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/9402","id":1248117288,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5KZMIo","user":{"login":"kishoreg","id":850791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg","html_url":"https://github.com/kishoreg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-15T13:40:07Z","updated_at":"2022-09-15T13:40:07Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"You have an OR clause on last payment which will result in full scan.. add range index on last payment and this will be very fast","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1248117288/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
