I'm able to detect whether the message is going over the wire or being routed locally pretty easily. If it's going over the wire I use `ContextCarrier` and if it's not I use `ContextSnapshot`.\r\n\r\nI'm a bit confused on how I should be handling the local routing scenario. For an example scenario, let's say I have a local message flow of: `A` -> `B` -> `C` (where `A` sends a message to `B` and so on) and that in turn triggers a response flow of: `C` -> `B` -> `A`  (where `C` responds to `B` and so on).\r\n\r\nIn this scenario, do I create any entry or exit spans or are they all supposed to be local? Your question about what I set the peer to set me down this path. Technically there wouldn't be a peer here because it's just communicating with itself. So should I just be creating a local spans?\r\n\r\nIf the answer is yes, would the process be:\r\n - create async local span when `A` calls `B`\r\n - create local span when `B` receives message from `A` (call continued with `A` context)\r\n - create async local span when `B` calls `C`\r\n - create local span when `C` receives message from `B` (call continued with `B` context)\r\n - close async local span when `C` responds to `B`\r\n - close async local span when `B` responds to `A`\r\n\r\nI think I've got the over the wire scenario covered.

This is a transaction problem. Workers will combine the data in memory with the data in db. The flow is: \r\n\r\nForEach memory data -> Get the same key data in memory -> combine memory and db -> into bulk process -> flush\r\n\r\nSo, if I don't flush it into db, I will get the dirty data from db next cycle. The bulk process settings are use for avoid send too many or too big size data into db, shred the sent data

Does that still apply with async spans though? The point at which I'm closing the span is when the message is being responded to. I can't think of something that would need to pick up the context at that point.\r\n\r\nIf I do need to create the local spans when I'm closing async local spans, what would you recommend for naming them? When I send a message to `X` and I'm waiting for a response, Vert.x generates `__vertx.reply` so it can route back. If I need those local spans can I keep the operation name like the JSON above? I didn't see any other integrations tests with dynamic operation names so I imagine not.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/477379781/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/477379847","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/2410#issuecomment-477379847","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/2410","id":477379847,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NzM3OTg0Nw==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-27T23:03:19Z","updated_at":"2019-03-27T23:03:19Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> I see that the DataCarrier in TraceSegmentServiceClient uses BufferStrategy.IF_POSSIBLE, so some segment will lose if there is too many segments to send.
