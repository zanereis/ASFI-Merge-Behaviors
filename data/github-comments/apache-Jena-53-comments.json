If we can't clean up the initialization process and eliminate these circular dependencies, we're essentially left with two problematic variants:\r\n\r\n1. **NullPointerException (NPE)** (prior to the https://github.com/apache/jena/commit/8654c07f23a892c03a7367981d814c3c8b094f62 change): If the user forgets to call JenaSystem.init() from a single-threaded context before using the library in a multithreaded environment, the application may encounter a NullPointerException. This can occur because certain components of the library remain uninitialized, leading to unexpected null references when accessed by multiple threads.\r\n\r\n2. **Deadlock** (since Jena 5.2.0): Alternatively, if the library is used in a multithreaded context without proper initialization, a deadlock may occur due to threads waiting on class initialization locks and synchronized methods. This is particularly difficult to diagnose because the application may simply hang without any clear indication of the cause.\r\n\r\nFor the **Deadlock** variant, I implemented a fail-fast approach that throws an informative exception.

LazyHolder is (I don't have a solution for that and it may be a non-issue because the second thread bumps into an initializing class.)\r\n \r\n@afs This pattern is a \"cleaner\" approach to static initialization, as it delegates synchronization responsibility to the JVM. It also guarantees the code executes only once. To replicate what the JVM does for us, we currently use `synchronized `and a secondary check within the synchronized block for any thread that reaches that point and is waiting:\r\n```java\r\nsynchronized(JenaSystem.class) {\r\n            if ( initialized )\r\n                return ;\r\n            ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI understand that introducing this pattern may have caused some confusion, as it does not directly contribute to solving the problem. The actual fix was simply moving `initialized = true;` back to its original position.\r\n\r\nSince I prefer to clean up code whenever I need to modify it, I introduced the pattern. We are early in the Jena 5.3 cycle, and we have code to reproduce the threading issues along with solid tests. I ran numerous test iterations that demonstrated stable behavior. \r\nGiven this, I valued the benefits of the initialization pattern over the potential risk of a different runtime behavior.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/2440095081/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/2440100196","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/2794#issuecomment-2440100196","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/2794","id":2440100196,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec6RcPlk","user":{"login":"arne-bdt","id":53625519,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjI1NTE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53625519?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arne-bdt","html_url":"https://github.com/arne-bdt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arne-bdt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arne-bdt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arne-bdt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arne-bdt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arne-bdt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arne-bdt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arne-bdt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arne-bdt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arne-bdt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-27T17:02:22Z","updated_at":"2024-10-27T17:02:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @arne-bdt , would you mind splitting this into the fix and tests?
