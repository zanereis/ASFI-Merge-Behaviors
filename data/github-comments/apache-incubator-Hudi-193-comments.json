For example, change `select * from hive.schema.hudi_table` to `select * from hudi.shema.hudi_table`. While, we also [proposed](https://github.com/prestodb/presto/issues/17006) the catalog remapping service, which would automatically change the catalog name without user effort. This might work as a new plugin in Presto. \r\n\r\nThe features like predicate pushdown are going to be also supported in hudi connector. Presto codebase makes a good abstraction on manipulation to parquet (, orc and other formats). We will reuse the good parts of existing code.\r\n\r\nThe performance of the hudi connector will be on par with hudi connector. In the early versions, hudi connector will have almost the same read path as hive connector. But we are going to add some specified optimization to get better performance for hudi queries.\r\n\r\nExactly, the new connector opens up the possibility to write into Hudi tables via Presto.

It's obviously causing problem as the stacktrace is complaining table not found, because the table path is overwritten to where the `.hoodie/` is not present. So the problem is about setting the correct table path. I suggest follow guide here https://hudi.apache.org/docs/query_engine_setup#prestodb and use the intended path.\r\n\r\nAlso please contact AWS support as this is under AWS environment, which we can't troubleshoot.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1015048564/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
