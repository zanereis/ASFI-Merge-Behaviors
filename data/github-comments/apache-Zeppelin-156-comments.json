This would work further everytime to rename from `title1.zpln` -> `title2.zpln`. But I was concerned more about scenario when user has 100 notes, and if he wants first time to convert them into new format (rename), he would need to enter every note and do something to initiate conversion. That would be little troublesome for user, so i thought maybe to initiate it during initial load for all notes as well.
