I don’t think one can deal with the alert only in the chat channel.\r\n\r\nMakes sense to me.  Quickly opening an alert from a message to get more context is probably better UX than adding too much info in Slack.  At the same time, being able to correlate which events might be related to an alert seems really powerful for things like web hooks.  If the events aren't delivered with the web hook that might be OK but I would imagine it would be something that an automated process monitoring alerts might be interested in.  What comes to mind are things like, notify me if a recent change of my service is correlated to another teams alert etc.  Having that context in Slack or WeChat probably isn't necessary but access from custom web hooks or other integrations might make sense.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/841846547/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/841907619","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/6888#issuecomment-841907619","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/6888","id":841907619,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0MTkwNzYxOQ==","user":{"login":"kezhenxu94","id":15965696,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTY1Njk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15965696?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94","html_url":"https://github.com/kezhenxu94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-17T00:41:57Z","updated_at":"2021-05-17T00:41:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Having that context in Slack or WeChat probably isn't necessary but access from custom web hooks or other integrations might make sense.\r\n\r\nI agree.
