we're talking past each other.\r\n\r\nCouchDB's original all_or_nothing semantic was that all the updates would be applied to the database or none would be. This was possible because there was a single file and an atomic operation to update the b+trees.\r\n\r\nWhen we added clustering, this semantic could no longer be honored without a consistency protocol / distributed transaction.\r\n\r\nThe current all_or_nothing behaviour is that the changes will be written even if they introduce conflicts. Not an obvious semantic.\r\n\r\nYour point about validate_doc_update functions is separate, the all_or_nothing behaviour worked whether there were VDU's or not. Perhaps there's a case for not processing a _bulk_docs request if any item fails the validation but it runs against our explicit choice of availability (for reads _and_ for writes) over consistency, and the long-held position that the unit of consistency is the individual document. It's also not guaranteed to be the case that all the writes would succeed if the validate_doc_update functions pass for every document in the _bulk_docs request.\r\n\r\nIn your original comment;\r\n\r\n> If the validation fails for the updated document, conflicts are deleted, but main document is not updated. If the sender is unable to solve such situation immediately, the data from the conflicted documents are lost.\r\n\r\nI don't recognise that behavior for CouchDB.

We have a document with conflicts.  There is main revision and the one or more conflicted revisions (deleted conflicts are not included)\r\n2.  Let there is some automate process which is able to merge the most of conflicts\r\n3. The automate process creates a new main document and then a set of delete requests for conflicted revisions. The conflicted revision is deleted by simple putting _deleted flag into it.\r\n4. The _bulk_docs request is prepared and send to couchdb\r\n5.  - question of the ordering? Is it better to put main revision as the first or as the last? With clustered database, this is hard to decide. In my code, i always put the main revision as the last, because if the changes are applied in the order - it is single document mapped to single shard(?) - the changes feed will contain deleted conflicts as the first and then the updated main revision.\r\n6. Now, we have VDU. The purpose of  VDU is also to detected malformed merged documents. \r\n7. however, the VDU rejects the malformed document, but it cannot reject deletion of the conflict. \r\n8. As the result, the conflicted revisions are deleted (and lost after compaction). The main revision is not updated, so updates are also lost.\r\n\r\nThe workaround is to reconstruct conflicted documents back using the data temporary stored in the memory of that automated process -  but this is very ugly solution. It would be better to call VDU on the main revision and test it before the write\r\n\r\nHmm, other workaround is to send main revision as the single request and delete conflicts only if the request passes. This has other issues. It needs two requests. The new revision of the main document can be replicated and it still looks like conflicted, because conflicts has not been deleted yet. There can be also another process (for instance on other replica) which will try to merge conflicts with already updated revision. So this is the reason, why I am sending  updated document as the last item\r\n\r\nTo improve the work with conflicts i have just another suggestion, the field \"_merged\", but this will need an another ticket and looks more complicated than above suggestion.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/376330010/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/376341829","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/997#issuecomment-376341829","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/997","id":376341829,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NjM0MTgyOQ==","user":{"login":"wohali","id":112292,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjI5Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112292?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali","html_url":"https://github.com/wohali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-26T23:14:05Z","updated_at":"2018-03-26T23:14:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@nickva

The removed check ` -    fabric:get_security(DbName, [{user_ctx,Ctx}]), % calls check_is_reader` is the primary check for reader access. I forget why the duplicate call to `fabric:get_security` was added to the auth check modules, but it was a relatively new addition in 2.x, whereas the check in `do_db_req` has been the primary check for a long time.\r\n\r\nThat said, the duplication of `fabric:get_security` is a bit brutal given how much of a hog that request is; this would be a non issue if we had `cassim` caching these values. If we can legitimately remove the duplication then great, but I'm concerned as this is removing the primary db reader check that has been used for many years, so let's make sure we get it right.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/376583614/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/376643450","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/373#issuecomment-376643450","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/373","id":376643450,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NjY0MzQ1MA==","user":{"login":"BigBlueHat","id":43209,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43209?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigBlueHat","html_url":"https://github.com/BigBlueHat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigBlueHat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigBlueHat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigBlueHat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigBlueHat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigBlueHat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigBlueHat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigBlueHat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigBlueHat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigBlueHat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-27T19:19:35Z","updated_at":"2018-03-27T19:19:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@wohali looks like `delegated_auth` needs an open source license first (at least).
