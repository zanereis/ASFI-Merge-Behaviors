If a segment first appears in `BrokerServerView`, it can be created as `SegmentWithOvershadowedStatus(isOvershadowed=false)`. Then if it later appears in `MetadataSegmentView` and it is not actually overshadowed, we reuse the existing object by probing `BrokerServerView`. If the arrived object has `isOvershadowed=true`, we just lose the opportunity to deduplicate this segment, but we expect it for the minority of segments, so that's fine.\r\n\r\nRegarding `SegmentWithOvershadowedStatus(isOvershadowed=false)` objects in `BrokerServerView` while the actual status is unknown: it seems weird at first glance but it's actually fine. The rule is that to probe `isOvershadowed` status we should *always* go through `MetadataSegmentView`. To guard against misuse, we can prohibit casting to `SegmentWithOvershadowedStatus` in the codebase on the Checkstyle or IntelliJ level.\r\n\r\n> What do you mean by 'prohibit' @leventov? I followed the link, and I don't see a suggestion about prohibiting equals and hashCode. (Just about prohibiting using DataSegments as keys in a map, which seems reasonable, given that usually people probably meant to use SegmentId.)\r\n\r\nSorry, I didn't re-check what did I propose there.

(Or, perhaps, [b] might not be a requirement, if the checking is bidirectional: BrokerServerView could also check with MetadataSegmentView.)\r\n\r\nIt sounds fine, but I think keeping SegmentWithOvershadowedStatus as a wrapper object makes more sense. There's some additional pointer overhead, but it should be low. And there are benefits:\r\n\r\n- The wrapper object approach allows DataSegment objects to _always_ be shared (not just when `overshadowed=false`).\r\n- The wrapper object approach avoids the \"weird at first glance but actually fine\" characteristic in BrokerServerView or the need to protect against misuse.\r\n- Senses of equality (or deep equality, as the case may be) can be murky when inheritance is involved. Is a SegmentWithOvershadowedStatus equal to a DataSegment if every field is equal other than `overshadowed`? Which behavior is best probably depends on where you are in the code. Composition through wrappers makes it very clear how the comparison works.\r\n\r\nI think these benefits outweigh the memory savings of removing one layer of wrapping in MetadataSegmentView.\r\n\r\nWhat do you all think?\r\n\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nSide notes:\r\n\r\nBy the way, I do think the idea to switch from interners to probing-based reuse is good and we should do that (although it doesn't need to be a 0.15.0 blocker).\r\n\r\nAnd on the topic of https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/issues/6358#issuecomment-489102183, it sounds like a good idea to me (DataSegment's `equals` behavior is a perennial source of confusion; it generally makes more sense to use SegmentId) but it should be doable separately, and also doesn't need to be a 0.15.0 blocker. Maybe some piece of it might be implemented as part of these changes (the deeplyEquals / allDataEquals could be useful) but the structural inspection stuff is better suited for another day.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/496450211/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/496452324","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/7778#issuecomment-496452324","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7778","id":496452324,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NjQ1MjMyNA==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-28T10:05:39Z","updated_at":"2019-05-28T10:05:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"You can call `/status` on each server over HTTP.

I guess it should be \"yes\" though since `overshadowed` isn't really \"data\".","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/496681942/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/496693508","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/7777#issuecomment-496693508","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7777","id":496693508,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NjY5MzUwOA==","user":{"login":"vogievetsky","id":177816,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzgxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177816?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky","html_url":"https://github.com/vogievetsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-28T21:17:42Z","updated_at":"2019-05-28T21:17:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Issue 7777!
