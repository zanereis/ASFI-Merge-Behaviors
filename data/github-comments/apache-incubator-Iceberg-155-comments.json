Here are some comments from https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4311\r\n\r\n---------------------------------\r\n \r\n> Of course, we have a scenario to write data to iceberg's v2 table through Flink CDC. They have non-primary key query scenarios. The current implementation in `core` will add a filter, which may lose the latest seq num equality delete files for Flink streaming writing. E.g: Table schema : (id int (primary key), date date) When seq num=1, Flink writes a record with `id=1, date='2021-01-01'`, will insert a data record with `id=1, date='2021-01-01'`, and a equality delete data record with an `id=1, date='2021-01-01'`; When seq num=2, writes a record with `id=1, date='2022-01-01'` to update, will insert a data record with `id=1, date='2022-01-01'`, and a equality delete record with `id=1 ,date='2022-01-01' `; At this time, when using `select * from xxx where date < '2022-01-01'` to query, due to the addition of the filter, the equality delete file written when seq num=2 will be filtered out.\r\n> \r\n> This is currently the easiest way to fix the problem. If we want to optimize for Flink upsert, then I think may need to read the latest records with the primary key that already exists in the table and write them to the equality delete file when writing, while instead of writing the inserted data to the equality delete file\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4311#issuecomment-1064774168\r\n\r\n---------------------------------\r\n> We seem to have the same issues.\r\n> \r\n> And it only happens on our Parquet table (doesn't happen on our Avro table).

For deleted manifest file, only the metric filed id in the `equality_ids` will be filtered, please refer to #4316 for details.\r\n> \r\n> I'm not sure which way is better, or that there is another better solution.\r\n> \r\n> I'm sorry if your PR is to address a different issues.\r\n> \r\n> Thx. 😄\r\n\r\n---------------------------------","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1066097462/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1066135751","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4315#issuecomment-1066135751","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4315","id":1066135751,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX84_i_DH","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-13T16:26:06Z","updated_at":"2022-03-13T16:26:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks, @kbendick!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1066135751/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1066137478","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4309#issuecomment-1066137478","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4309","id":1066137478,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX84_i_eG","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-13T16:36:18Z","updated_at":"2022-03-13T16:36:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks, @singhpk234!

In particular, some file output committers use `_` before moving their data over via rename operation, which might be something that needs to be cleaned up using `RemoveOrphanFiles` in case the job fails at a specific time.\r\n\r\nPlease correct me if I'm mistaken about the file output committers as I tend to personally use S3 (and then either S3FileIO or S3A) and the magic output committers if using s3a. \r\n\r\nBut if we're detecting partition paths automatically and not filtering on those, then possibly we'd want to keep this second scenario as an additional option.\r\n\r\nI have also not historically used HDFS much in production scenarios, so possibly I'm mistaken about the benefits / utility of having hidden paths or how they'd end up in the directory structure of the table (outside of the previously two mentioned situations). Please feel free to let me know if I'm mistaken. 🙂 \r\n\r\n> Also, where should I document the new option?\r\n\r\nFor documenting the new option, let's worry about that once we get it confirmed into the right place. But definitely let's be sure to document it.\r\n\r\nI would start with adding it as a JavaDoc comment, assuming that there is a JavaDoc comment for the class already that documents the options for the action (I believe there is). Once we're closer to the final solution, we can also find a place in the docs themselves to put this option if necessary.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1067032631/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1067115454","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4326#issuecomment-1067115454","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4326","id":1067115454,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX84_muO-","user":{"login":"ajantha-bhat","id":5889404,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODk0MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5889404?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat","html_url":"https://github.com/ajantha-bhat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-14T17:50:20Z","updated_at":"2022-03-14T17:50:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"cc: @rdblue , @RussellSpitzer , @jackye1995 , @nastra ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1067115454/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1067119021","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4326#issuecomment-1067119021","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4326","id":1067119021,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX84_mvGt","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-14T17:54:26Z","updated_at":"2022-03-14T17:54:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"We don't put a `version.txt` file in the main branch.

The [plugin](https://github.com/palantir/gradle-git-version) adds a gradle task `printVersion`.\r\n\r\nThis is equivalent to `git describe --tags --always --first-parent`, though we pass in the `release-base-` so it filters on that.\r\n\r\nTo test your idea, I tried tagging locally.\r\n\r\n```\r\n➜   ./gradlew printVersion\r\n\r\n> Task :printVersion\r\n0.13.0-SNAPSHOT\r\n\r\n➜  git describe --tags --always --first-parent\r\nrelease-base-0.12.0-646-g7f07ed451\r\n\r\n➜  git tag release-base-0.13.0\r\n➜  git describe --tags --always --first-parent\r\nrelease-base-0.13.0\r\n➜  ./gradlew printVersion\r\n\r\n> Task :printVersion\r\n0.14.0-SNAPSHOT\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo if we wanted to publish a snapshot using the next minor version number (14 in this case), and ignore the fact that we might ship a patch now and then, what you suggested would be correct @rdblue.\r\n\r\nIf we wanted to take into account the patch, we could match on it. But presently we're more or less always working towards the next minor version, and then occasionally releasing a patch that only cherry-picks.\r\n\r\nSo the build against `master` represents the build for the next minor version (and not the next patch) in my opinion.\r\n\r\n**TLDR** - tagging `release-base-0.13.0` will start building as

But only problem is that we may not be able to create an exact tag on `master` branch for that release as we have released from the `release` branch and commits may not be same.
