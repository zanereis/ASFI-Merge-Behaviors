This will introduce more GC workload and need more CPU cycles to repack the message. You can see https://github.com/apache/pulsar/wiki/PIP-70%3A-Introduce-lightweight-raw-Message-metadata, try to avoid serialize and deserialize the message again on the server-side.\r\n\r\nI want to describe my rough idea, If it is a batch message, we have message metadata for the batch and single message metadata for each message. So I think we can add all tags into the message metadata of the batch. For example, 2 messages in a batch and property1 for message0 is 1, property1 for message1 is 2. So that we can add property1 = [1,2] in the batch message metadata. So, the broker can filter out the batches.\r\n\r\n—\r\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\r\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub<https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/8544#issuecomment-727122863>, or unsubscribe<https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AOCHXI2WO2OROLP642TSQX3SPXSQPANCNFSM4TTIVMRQ>.\r\n\r\nThis communication contains information which is confidential and may also be privileged.

@wolfstudy @flowchartsman\r\n> I think to get `userConfigs` by create a new `FunctionContext` is a little bit odd, especially in some scenarios like initialize database connections before go function starts. The reason I think it is odd is that `FunctionContext` is an implementation of request-scoped values that passed with `context.Value`, and the context should only be integrated within the instance of go function. Once we propagate `FunctionContext` outside the go function instance, it will break the design of `context`.\r\n> \r\n> So i suggest we have two ways to get `userConfigs`:\r\n> \r\n> * When go function starts (`pf.Start` called), user can get `userConfigs` with `FromContext(ctx)`, like `contextFunc` defined above. This is just like Java and Python functions and follows the design of context.\r\n> * Before go function starts (before `pf.Start` called), user can get `userConfigs` from `Conf` defined in `conf/conf.go`, with json string -> map.\r\n\r\nThis method was chosen just for convenience. In point of fact the context is created anew with invocation of `pf.FromContext()` by the unexported functions like so: \r\n\r\n```go\r\ninstanceConf := newInstanceConf()\r\nuserConfigs := buildUserConfig(instanceConf.funcDetails.GetUserConfig())\r\n``` \r\n\r\nSo this was the quickest route, but I can issue a PR to do it more directly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/728355187/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/728580536","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/8549#issuecomment-728580536","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/8549","id":728580536,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyODU4MDUzNg==","user":{"login":"codelipenghui","id":12592133,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTkyMTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12592133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui","html_url":"https://github.com/codelipenghui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-17T01:02:13Z","updated_at":"2020-11-17T01:02:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"/pulsarbot
