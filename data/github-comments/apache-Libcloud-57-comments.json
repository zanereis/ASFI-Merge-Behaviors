If you'd rather skip all updates until the next major or minor version, let me know by commenting `@dependabot ignore this major version` or `@dependabot ignore this minor version`. You can also ignore all major, minor, or patch releases for a dependency by adding an [`ignore` condition](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates#ignore) with the desired `update_types` to your config file.\n\nIf you change your mind, just re-open this PR and I'll resolve any conflicts on it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/1146776956/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/1146780196","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/1699#issuecomment-1146780196","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/1699","id":1146780196,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAZm485EWnok","user":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-05T10:29:49Z","updated_at":"2022-06-05T10:29:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Short therm this change looks good to me, but long term we should figure out how we can integrate it into standard ``get_size_pricing()`` method.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/1146780196/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/1146780464","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/1699#issuecomment-1146780464","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/1699","id":1146780464,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAZm485EWnsw","user":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-05T10:32:09Z","updated_at":"2022-06-05T10:32:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@Eis-D-Z Thanks for the contribution.

I do not fully understand the impact of bumping the API versions, but if tests pass, I think it should be fine. Thoughts?\r\n\r\nIntegration tests would increase the confidence here, but sadly we don't have integration tests for Azure ARM.\r\n\r\n >  The new API version also caused request and response payloads to differ i.e. the volume types are now passed as [DiskSku](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/compute/disks/create-or-update?tabs=HTTP#disksku) objects instead of strings. How do we handle API changes? Is there documentation around making such API changes?\r\n\r\nOne option would be to allow user to pass ``api_version`` or similar argument to the constructor and then when user specifies a new version which uses new ``DISK_API_VERSION`` value, otherwise it would default to the previous value. This could / would of course increase complexity a lot so it only means sense to do it for major breaking API changes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/1235829430/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/1235839006","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/1744#issuecomment-1235839006","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/1744","id":1235839006,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAZm485JqWge","user":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-02T19:38:24Z","updated_at":"2022-09-02T19:38:24Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks

used).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/1237456266/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/1238459050","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/1755#issuecomment-1238459050","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/1755","id":1238459050,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAZm485J0WKq","user":{"login":"dependabot[bot]","id":49699333,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDk2OTkzMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/29110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/dependabot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-06T17:34:07Z","updated_at":"2022-09-06T17:34:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Superseded
