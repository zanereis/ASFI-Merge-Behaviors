after some thinking bundling multiple sources or sinks in NARs is problematic for us to support.  Our current reasoning for using the NAR format for connectors is so that users don't have to 1) upload anything (for built-in connectors) and 2) so that the user don't have to specify a classpath.  If we were to bundle multiple sources or sinks in a single NAR, the user has to now specify a classpath or some identifier which adds not only complexity to our code but as well as user experience.  \r\n\r\nBundling multiple sources and sinks into a NAR makes sense for built-in connectors, but currently we also allow users to submit NARs from the CLI for source and sinks. Like I mentioned before, having to support submitting NARs with multiple sources and sinks adds a lot more additional complexity in the code as we must also support submitting NARs with single sources and sinks. We will have to support NARs of two different formats. User's will also have to uploaded a larger package than needed as the NAR with contain code and dependencies for other sources an sinks.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/462643980/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/462724484","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/3490#issuecomment-462724484","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/3490","id":462724484,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MjcyNDQ4NA==","user":{"login":"tuan6956","id":20284059,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMjg0MDU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20284059?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuan6956","html_url":"https://github.com/tuan6956","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuan6956/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuan6956/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuan6956/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuan6956/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuan6956/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuan6956/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuan6956/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuan6956/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuan6956/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-12T11:30:32Z","updated_at":"2019-02-12T11:32:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"my
