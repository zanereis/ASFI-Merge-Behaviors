Let me think a bit out loud.\n\nOpenNLP is a lib and a toolset (command line tools).\n\n**Lib**: So ideally we'd need to give dev users of the lib enough flexibility to choose a logging lib of their choice. SLF4J is a facade and if properly used, SLF4J should do that. That also means that dependencies beyond slf4j-api, that is, to any particular logging implementation is a drag (log4j-slf4j-impl, log4j-api, log4j-core). What if I'm with logback? Therefore probably slf4j-api should be the only extra dependency for OpenNLP lib.\n\nThe usage model here is then as follows: use OpenNLP from your particular project with your particular logging lib and keep your-log-lib dependencies and config files in your project.\n\n**Toolset**: OpenNLP is also a toolset. And here it would be best not to bother end-users with need to configure extra logging, but provide some sensible defaults, probably just emulating current behavior. Therefore, some logging backend should be provided and configured to work out-of-the-box. With optional how-to. I'd go for logback as default backend, and for configuration I'd emulate current behavior in the default log (e.g. no date, class, thread - just the message).\n\n**Logging particulars and code patterns.**\nGoing from\n\n``` java\nSystem.err.println(\"Skipping corrupt line: \"+line);\n```\n\nto\n\n``` java\nLOGGER.warn(\"Skipping corrupt line: \"+line);\n```\n\ncan be improved. A better pattern would be\n\n``` java\nLOGGER.warn(\"Skipping corrupt line: {}\", line);\n```\n\nThis will hopefully lead to fewer string allocations and reduced logging performance penalty. Same note applies everywhere in this pull, especially in places where message is being preconstructed:\n\n``` java\nString msg = \"Could not instantiate...\nLOGGER.error(msg...\n```\n\nThose would better be refactored.\n\n**`Log and throw` patterns should be avoided**. But that might lead to changing current behavior, so needs a deeper look. But it would be a good refactoring anyway.\n\n**Logging level should be refactored from messages**:\n\n``` java\nLOGGER.warn(\"Error: ...\n```\n\n**This refactoring is a good opportunity to reconsider logging levels**.\n\n``` java\nLOGGER.trace(\"Building ngram dictionary ... \");\n```\n\nThat was a progress-message, so maybe info rather than trace.\n\nIt is also a good time to **reconsider manual formatting in logs**:\n\n``` java\nLOGGER.info(\"Indexing events using cutoff of \" + cutoff + \"\\n\");\n...\nLOGGER.info(\"\\tComputing event counts...  \");\n```\n\n\\n and \\t are not very welcome in logs.\n\nIt is also a good time to **reconsider \"debug\" printing interface**. Going from \n\n``` java\n        if (debugOn) {\n            System.out.print(derivationStage + \" \" + derivationRank + \" \"+tp.getProb());\n            tp.show();\n            System.out.println();\n        }\n```\n\nto \n\n``` java\n        if (LOGGER.isDebugEnabled()) {\n            System.out.print(derivationStage + \" \" + derivationRank + \" \"+tp.getProb());\n            tp.show();\n            System.out.println();\n        }\n```\n\nstill leaves some `System.out.print`.\n\nIt would also be good to **involve the team and discuss this with others**.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/opennlp/issues/comments/231728577/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/opennlp/issues/comments/231730972","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/opennlp/pull/5#issuecomment-231730972","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/opennlp/issues/5","id":231730972,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMTczMDk3Mg==","user":{"login":"jzonthemtn","id":13176962,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTc2OTYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13176962?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzonthemtn","html_url":"https://github.com/jzonthemtn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzonthemtn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzonthemtn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzonthemtn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzonthemtn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzonthemtn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzonthemtn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzonthemtn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzonthemtn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzonthemtn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-11T13:17:14Z","updated_at":"2016-07-11T13:17:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I tried to standardize some of the logging as I mentioned in the JIRA issue.

Anyway, team consensus might be more important than individual opinion, which is I included the need for team discussion.\n\n@reckart Good to hear, thank you. JUL is the only logger without extra dependency, but the interface is so-so (e.g. SLF4J is less of a performance impact). I'd stay away from Commons Logging as it causes more problems than it solves (dependency, maintenance, performance).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/opennlp/issues/comments/231749154/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/opennlp/issues/comments/231749892","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/opennlp/pull/5#issuecomment-231749892","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/opennlp/issues/5","id":231749892,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMTc0OTg5Mg==","user":{"login":"autayeu","id":495207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/495207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/autayeu","html_url":"https://github.com/autayeu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autayeu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autayeu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autayeu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autayeu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autayeu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autayeu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autayeu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autayeu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autayeu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-11T14:24:45Z","updated_at":"2016-07-11T14:24:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@reckart Typical way for integrators with SLF4J is to use bridges.
