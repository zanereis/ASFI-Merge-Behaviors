still working on this (basically with method replacements like local-executor/local-transfer-executor-tuple, which was originally executor/mk-executor-transfer-fn)<br/>\n    2. my code base is behind master, so after all tests pass I will make a full merge from master<br/>\n    Hopefully I can finish the problems by this week.</p>\n\n<p>    Still, the base structure/design of the executor won't change, so I think I can get reviews from you first on the design.</p>\n\n<p>You can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:</p>\n\n<p>    $ git pull <a

, sorry for the late reply, i was on leave and just now i send the updated spout to you, pls help review. Below is the major changes:\n1. In poll method, change numUncommittedOffsets < kafkaSpoutConfig.getMaxUncommittedOffsets()\nto emitted.size() < kafkaSpoutConfig.getMaxUncommittedOffsets();\n2. In method doSeekRetriableTopicPartitions, seems your code is contradicted with the comment, i changed \n**from:**\n    else {\n          kafkaConsumer.seekToEnd(rtp);    // Seek to last committed offset\n     }\n**To:** \n              else {\n                    //  kafkaConsumer.seekToEnd(rtp);    // Seek to last committed offset\n                    OffsetAndMetadata commitOffset = kafkaConsumer.committed(rtp);\n                    kafkaConsumer.seek(rtp, commitOffset.offset());  // Seek to last committed offset\n                }\n1. in ack method, we found acked.get(msgId.getTopicPartition()) might return null so we add some defensive validation - possibly due to kafka consumer rebalance, the partition doesn't belongs to this spout anymore\n2. in OffsetEntry.add method, we add one condition, only add the message when condition is met -             if (msgId.offset() > committedOffset). This change was also applied in method doSeekRetriableTopicPartitions.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/221465746/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612910985","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/5646#issuecomment-2612910985","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/5646","id":2612910985,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI5MTA5ODU=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-25T04:15:11Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T16:20:27Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a

Can you instead log an Error, ignore the message and proceed further?\n\nThis means data loss to users. I am not sure data loss is acceptable or not. As I mentioned above, [ConsumerIterator](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/a81ad2582ee0e533d335fe0dc5c5cc885dbf645d/core/src/main/scala/kafka/consumer/ConsumerIterator.scala) chooses to throw an exception (MessageTooLargeException, which will cause Kafka Consumer to stop working), so I think maybe it is a good way. \n\n> what do you mean by \"topology will fetch no data but still be running\"? Will it stop fetching data at all?\n\nThe spout will keep trying to fetch data, but the response from Kafka contains no valid bytes because of size limit. The side effect of this is that the data in Kafka topic will pile up while users don't know why their storm topology stops processing messages (there is no data to process).\n\nI think you are right that many users don't want to stall the worker because of one large message, but this a result of incorrect config (KafkaConfig.fetchSizeBytes) and if they want to avoid this situation, they need to set a really large size limit at the first time.\nMaybe there are better ways to handle this situation, let's figure it out together:)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/221528200/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/221550255","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1445#issuecomment-221550255","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1445","id":221550255,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMTU1MDI1NQ==","user":{"login":"unsleepy22","id":631361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTM2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/unsleepy22","html_url":"https://github.com/unsleepy22","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unsleepy22/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unsleepy22/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unsleepy22/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unsleepy22/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unsleepy22/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unsleepy22/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unsleepy22/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unsleepy22/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unsleepy22/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-25T11:50:56Z","updated_at":"2016-05-25T11:50:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"All

Having a spout that is stuck forever is really bad, but having it crash, lose data, come back up and repeat the process possibly draining the other partitions feels even worse.  I guess if you configured your spouts for at most once processing then you got what you asked for, even if it was shoot yourself in the foot, and storm is fail fast so it fits with that philosophy.\n\nPlease at least update the exception message to indicate what the sizes are actually set to.  I think this would make life simpler for the user that is in this situation, so they see the error message and it says something like.\n\n`Found a message (10,485,760 bytes) that is larger than the maximum fetch size (1,048,576 bytes) in topic myGreatTopic partition 5 at fetch offset 103404502.

Could you please help confirm if my assumption is correct?\n\nIf my assumption is not correct - which means one emitted message may not be able to get acked or failed message back, then we must change the spout(need a timeout setting if failed to find next continuous message to commit) - currently the spout will always find the next continuous message to commit, it will try forever...\n\ndue to the spout will always find the next continuous message to commit, we need to be cautious for below method:\nprivate boolean poll() {\n        return !waitingToEmit() && emitted.size() < kafkaSpoutConfig.getMaxUncommittedOffsets();\n    }\nif the MaxUncommittedOffsets is too small, the spout will frequently stop polling from kafka, if a rebalance happened and seek back to the failed message, at this moment if the spout stop polling, will also cause the spout failed to find the next committed message. Currently we set this value to 200000 and seems working fine for now.\nLooking forward to hearing from you!
