I think we should address a few points before merging it:\n- The old code had the `isFieldConstant()` method on the optimizer nodes. You are adding more methods for forwarded fields. I think better design is to remove all of those methods and directly supply the `SemanticProperties` to the (Requested)Global/LocalProperties. The Semantic properties would need a method like `getForwardedFields(int input, int field)`.\n- The methods in the (Requested)Global/LocalProperties can then be renamed to `filterBySemanticProperties()`, rather than `filterByNodesConstantSet()`.\n- The `LocalProperties` have recently been changed to be an immutable type. That is much less error-prone in applications like the optimizer. The getters (for the set of unique fields) should also return immutable types (like `Collections.unmodifiableSet(set)`). Similar things would be good for the `GlobalProperties`, `RequestedGlobalProperties`, and `RequestedLocalProperties`.\n- Given that this is really logic is sensitive and crucial to the correctness of the optimizer, I think we need to have a few dedicated tests for the `filterBySemanticProperties()` method in the classes `GlobalProperties`, `LocalProperties`, `RequestedGlobalProperties`, and `RequestedLocalProperties`. There is currently only one test that test end-to-end some properties, but leaves out many cases.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/47893090/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/47893188","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/20#issuecomment-47893188","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20","id":47893188,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3ODkzMTg4","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-03T11:03:48Z","updated_at":"2014-07-03T11:03:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Will this one be updated?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/47893188/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/47894397","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/29#issuecomment-47894397","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/29","id":47894397,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3ODk0Mzk3","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-03T11:19:48Z","updated_at":"2014-07-03T11:19:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks good.
