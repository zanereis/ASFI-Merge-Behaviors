From the pom.xml you shared above - https://github.com/stefanbirkner/system-rules/blob/system-rules-1.16.0/pom.xml it does seem like junit-dep is a compile time dependency. You also mentioned that this dependency is not used anywhere and so you are adding the exclusion. Did you see any build time warning or dependency conflicts in Hudi that caused you to raised this PR? Can you please clarify?\r\n> Although this is a simple change, there might be other unused dependencies from external libraries same like this case. We havent gone after them unless the jar size is bloating or there are conflicts etc. Thats why understanding your case would help us better to determine if others also need to be checked out.\r\n\r\nThanks. When compile the project, always need download the latest `junit-dep` version.\r\n\r\n```\r\n<dependency>\r\n    <groupId>junit</groupId>\r\n    <artifactId>junit-dep</artifactId>\r\n    <version>[4.9,)</version>\r\n</dependency>\r\n```\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/578889066/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/578903392","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/1216#issuecomment-578903392","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1216","id":578903392,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3ODkwMzM5Mg==","user":{"login":"n3nash","id":2722167,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MjIxNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2722167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash","html_url":"https://github.com/n3nash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-27T19:08:23Z","updated_at":"2020-01-27T19:08:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@liujianhuiouc Could you please address the last comment ?

After tracking the git history, the `<junit-dep.version>4.10</junit-dep.version>` was introduced via PR #846 . And the dependency was used in `hudi-cli/pom.xml`. Then, the dependency was removed via HUDI-159. These actions are both invoked by @vinothchandar .\r\n> \r\n> Regarding the exclusion, @hmatu can you share the result of `system-rules` via `mvn dependency:tree`? Thanks.\r\n\r\n@bhasudha IMO, we can accept this PR (without the added exclusion property). In the early time, Hudi clearly introduced `junit-dep` dependency, just like I mentioned before. However, the dependency has been clearly removed, so the line `<junit-dep.version>4.10</junit-dep.version>` belongs to the legacy line. We can remove it.\r\n\r\nAbout the added exclusion property, we can add it or not. Although as @hmatu said, it would always be downloaded. However, it does not matter. It did not cause the version conflict. \r\n\r\nIMO, the exclusion property is usually used to handle version conflict of the same dependency. Generally, we clearly introduce a specific-version dependency then exclude the transitive dependencies which are owned by other dependencies.

The same name/description is used for all stages which use the same thread until the name/description is updated (another call to setJobDescription) or deleted (clearJobGroup).\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I am using the ClassName as the stage name and a textual description derived from the method logic. HUDI classes have very descriptive names so this works well.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways this may be done:\r\n1. Manually (this PR) by adding code set the name/description before any DAG stages are started. \r\n2. Using Java AOP to automatically find code locations matching some pattern and augment them with the call to setJobDescription. \r\n\r\nTo use AOP approach, we can create a separate AspectJ file containing the Pointcuts (code locations to augment) and Advices (code to insert). There is a separate AspectJ compiler which at runtime can change the class bytecode to add the Advices. \r\n\r\nPros of AOP approach:\r\n1. Does not require any change in current code\r\n2. Also covers future code automatically\r\n3. Easy to undo (just don't run the AspectJ compiler as part of build)\r\n4. Can be extended to more use-cases like automating Metrics.\r\n\r\nCons of AOP approach:\r\n1. Require AspectJ and its compiler to be integrated with the HUDI build chain\r\n2. The Advice cannot be dynamic. Hence we cannot provide descriptions to the DAG stages (we can still use the class name as the DAG stage name). \r\n\r\nSince the code has a manageable number of places where DAG is created, I prefer the simpler manual approach.

They would have to make a custom build right?  \r\n\r\nIn short, I don't know if this is a good idea..  \r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/582238771/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/582242214","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/1174#issuecomment-582242214","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1174","id":582242214,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MjI0MjIxNA==","user":{"login":"n3nash","id":2722167,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MjIxNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2722167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash","html_url":"https://github.com/n3nash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-05T05:06:18Z","updated_at":"2020-02-05T05:06:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Just checked this PR and for some reason my comments weren't submitted last time I added a review, adding them again, expect them in a couple of hours","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/582242214/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/582246372","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/1306#issuecomment-582246372","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1306","id":582246372,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MjI0NjM3Mg==","user":{"login":"lamberken","id":20113411,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTEzNDEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20113411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken","html_url":"https://github.com/lamberken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-05T05:26:55Z","updated_at":"2020-02-05T06:33:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi @bhasudha, I did and verify that \"org.apache.hudi\" to \"hudi\" https://github.com/apache/incubator-hudi/pull/1054 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/582246372/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
