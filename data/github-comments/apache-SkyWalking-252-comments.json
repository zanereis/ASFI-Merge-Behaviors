We could have typically SimpleClient or BatchClient to deal with different data model. Or add QueryClient in the future.\r\n- All read/write/query should be organized on the top of different entity, which is the normal case. Take a reference from InfluxDB or ElasticSearch client. Such as, TraceWrite should be an object could host the fields and tags.
