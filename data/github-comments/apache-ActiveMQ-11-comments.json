This is to say that I might not be remembering all the details 100% correctly. \r\n\r\nWe run .NET applications in on-premises customer environments that we do not control. Those applications use the NMS client library to connect to AMQ, and consume topics using durable subscriptions. In certain customer environments, these client applications can experience sustained unreliable network connectivity. The reasons for the flaky connectivity were varied, but the common result was that some clients would get into a state where they would fail to acknowledge messages. On the other hand, those same clients managed to reconnect (via the failover transport) often enough to keep their durable subscriptions active. Without the setting introduced by this PR, those unACKed messages continue to be referenced by those active subscriptions well after the message TTL expires. This was ultimately leading to quota exhaustion as those expired messages could never be purged.\r\n\r\nI hope that helps!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/comments/1082266184/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/comments/1082350016","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/activemq/pull/571#issuecomment-1082350016","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/571","id":1082350016,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmM85Ag1nA","user":{"login":"ncasaux","id":16475875,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDc1ODc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16475875?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncasaux","html_url":"https://github.com/ncasaux","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncasaux/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncasaux/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncasaux/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncasaux/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncasaux/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncasaux/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncasaux/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncasaux/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncasaux/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-29T20:36:40Z","updated_at":"2022-03-29T20:36:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for the clarification!

Even so, I think we need to agree on new terms. For example, to update https://activemq.apache.org/networks-of-brokers#masterslave-discovery with new instructions, how do I refer to the pair of brokers using shared storage if not master/slave? I know Matt proposed some wording on slack that dances around the problem, but there are lots of other places in the docs that could use updating as well :) ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/comments/1115978234/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/comments/1115984626","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/activemq/pull/835#issuecomment-1115984626","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/835","id":1115984626,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmM85ChJLy","user":{"login":"michaelpearce-gain","id":50627341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjI3MzQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50627341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelpearce-gain","html_url":"https://github.com/michaelpearce-gain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelpearce-gain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelpearce-gain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelpearce-gain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelpearce-gain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelpearce-gain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelpearce-gain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelpearce-gain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelpearce-gain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelpearce-gain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-03T11:18:10Z","updated_at":"2022-05-03T11:19:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"So to replace wording of master/slave with either primary/secondary or leader/follower as i stated requires a proposal and a vote in dev mailing list plain and simple there is no way to dance around it, in slack or PR's. \r\n\r\nBut for this PR i think just deprecation (not yet removal) of convenience method is simplest and cleanest.

Please characterize in more detail (or point to an example) of a _unit_ test as you described.\r\n> \r\n\r\nA unit test tests a particular unit, not the entire thing. The API changes that affect the Message instances for example, almost none of them actually need a message to be sent or received, they are largely orthoganl. Even the ones that you might want to system test 'for completeness', the underlying behaviour can still be unit tested more closely without a broker. The new producer API as another example, a significant chunk of that can be tested without ever creating a connection.\r\n\r\nThere are many different approaches, but a basic thing as I just covered would be I wouldnt expect the whole client or a broker to be needed at all for many of the checks for the stuff being added, which is largely just a new API for using existing functionality. The new bits can be tested in isolation. A lot of the stuff being tested never needs to hit the wire and so never needs a broker or the time wasted on starting it and connecting to it etc, or waiting on messages to be consumed to check things easily verified before they were ever actually sent etc. \r\n\r\n> I'm happy to re-work and improve test execution time and structure. Others had requested test coverage for message types and ack modes.\r\n\r\nThere are other ways to cover things. E.g unit tests. Running the same system test over and over and varying things that ultimately have almost no relation to the thing being tested, is a complete waste of time.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/comments/1119508345/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/comments/1119535536","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/activemq/pull/729#issuecomment-1119535536","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/729","id":1119535536,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmM85CusGw","user":{"login":"gemmellr","id":5106823,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMDY4MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5106823?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gemmellr","html_url":"https://github.com/gemmellr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gemmellr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gemmellr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gemmellr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gemmellr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gemmellr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gemmellr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gemmellr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gemmellr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gemmellr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-06T11:52:23Z","updated_at":"2022-05-06T11:52:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Local MacBook Pro (total 32.535s):\r\n> Apache Jenkins CI (total 43.921s):\r\n> \r\n\r\nI'm taking it from the comments here and https://github.com/apache/activemq/pull/729#discussion_r866242620) that 32-44 seconds isnt seen as a that long of a time for this, so thats going to be the key mismatch in our views.
