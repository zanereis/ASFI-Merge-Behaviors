The concern for reimplementing is that it creates duplication and fragments. For short-term workaround it is fine, but for the long run, I think deduping to one implementation makes more sense. Otherwise, when new filters are added in Parquet, we need to reimplement them here. Column index is one, and bloom filer is another one on the way, and so on. If some filters in Iceberg but not in Parquet, we can bring in to the Parquet community to add them.

It is still useful to have it because some engines may use `create` without overwrite to write data files. And although there are no guarantees when used concurrently, at least only one writer wins. We've had issues with concurrent writes corrupting version-hint.txt files in other file systems, so a lack of guarantees isn't unique to S3.\r\n\r\nI had to make some significant changes in order to make create work in what seems like a reasonable way, but there's lots of behavioral things to consider.  For example, S3InputFile caches the exists call (as does the S3OutputFile now).  I believe we do that to optimize for a traditional exists() -> contentLength() -> open() pattern so that we don't make multiple requests to get the same information from S3.  However, this may not make sense in the create path.\r\n\r\nThis also exposes some strange aspects of the FileIO api in that `deleteFile` is a function of `FileIO` and `exists()` is a function of `InputFile` (though not `OutputFile`).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/721415513/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/721417229","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1573#issuecomment-721417229","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1573","id":721417229,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyMTQxNzIyOQ==","user":{"login":"danielcweeks","id":4925077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MjUwNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4925077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweeks","html_url":"https://github.com/danielcweeks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweeks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweeks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweeks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweeks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweeks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweeks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweeks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweeks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweeks/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-03T22:56:18Z","updated_at":"2020-11-03T22:56:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jackye1995 and @rdblue I created a very basic `S3URI` class to replace the `AmazonS3URI`.

I could be convinced otherwise, but it would take a lot of work to use Parquet filters.\r\n\r\nAfter my comment yesterday, I was looking at the implementation here and [noticed another problem](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1566#discussion_r516902119): Parquet expects a filter that references columns using the name that was written into each data file. Iceberg allows renaming and so the Iceberg filters are written to use field IDs instead of names. That is needed for correctness. If I rename field `a` to `x`, then I have to rewrite the filter `x > 5` to `a > 5` when reading an old data file, or else Parquet thinks there are no matching records because column `x` is not present and is all nulls.\r\n\r\nParquet also doesn't support customizing the filter in `ReadSupport`, so to do this you have to read each file's footer to get its schema, rewrite the filter, and then open the file again to read it.\r\n\r\nI'm remembering more of the issues with the original filter path now, and I think that it makes more sense to do the work in Iceberg for now, with the intent to get the work upstream in a 2.0 Parquet API that fixes some of these issues.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/721874701/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/721899321","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1566#issuecomment-721899321","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1566","id":721899321,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyMTg5OTMyMQ==","user":{"login":"shangxinli","id":31421745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNDIxNzQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31421745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shangxinli","html_url":"https://github.com/shangxinli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shangxinli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shangxinli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shangxinli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shangxinli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shangxinli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shangxinli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shangxinli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shangxinli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shangxinli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-04T18:28:37Z","updated_at":"2020-11-04T18:28:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rdblue I think it makes sense.

Now that 0.10.0 is about ready to go, I think I will have more time to help get this in.\r\n\r\nI've found it difficult to review this one, I think because I've ended up losing context between reviews. Right now, the changes are large enough that it takes me a few days to get time to review. And if it takes you a few days to get the time to update, then we end up with quite a while between reviews and it is harder to pick it back up and continue. I think to avoid that, we may want to look for ways to break this into smaller, easier to review changes. Is there anything that you think we can split out right now?
