Previously, the POM for `extensions/druid-parquet-extensions` had an explicit dependency on `snappy-java-1.1.7.2`. However, `snappy-java` is a transitive dependency of `org.apache.parquet:parquet-hadoop:jar:1.10.1:compile`, which depends on `snappy-java-1.1.2.6`.\r\n\r\n`mapdb-1.08` was previously in core but this PR moves the dependency to the module that directly uses it. As a result, it's gone from `lib` and now appears in `extensions/druid-lookups-cached-global` and in `druid-kafka-extraction-namespace` (the latter has a compile dependency on the former, and thus transitive compile dependency on `mapdb-1.08`).\r\n\r\nThere are no references to `commons-cli` in the java code. Looks like `io.airlift:airline` is currently used for CLI parsing in various places.\r\n\r\nThere are no references to `commons-pool-1.6` in the java code (However, `org.apache.commons:commons-pool2` is used via a transitive dependency of `org.apache.commons:commons-dbcp2`).\r\n\r\nI believe `netty-all` is an all-in-one jar and since the POM has dependencies on the various netty subcomponents (`netty-buffer`, `netty-common`, etc), the `dependency:analyze` is reporting that `netty-all` is not used and so it was removed from `sql/pom.xml`.\r\n\r\nAfter the changes in this PR, the druid distribution `tar.gz` is reduced from 198MB to 192MB.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/528104856/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/528119132","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/8462#issuecomment-528119132","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8462","id":528119132,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyODExOTEzMg==","user":{"login":"himanshug","id":246308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjMwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug","html_url":"https://github.com/himanshug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-04T22:35:57Z","updated_at":"2019-09-04T22:35:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I triggered the travis build.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/528119132/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/528122181","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/8458#issuecomment-528122181","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8458","id":528122181,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyODEyMjE4MQ==","user":{"login":"himanshug","id":246308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjMwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug","html_url":"https://github.com/himanshug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-04T22:49:25Z","updated_at":"2019-09-04T22:49:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"before this patch, we were leaving the process up with stopped lifecycle which would be a kind of zombie state anyway. only case it is useful to leave the zombie process running would be for debugging it to potentially find the cause.

I think it would make sense to hold off until that PR is merged, and instead do what you would like to achieve in this PR as a `RandomLocationSelectorStrategy` to set `locationSelectorStrategy` to

possible that there is some bug as well.

you for creating this issue.\r\n\r\nDuring ingestion, `persist()` can happen multiple times for the same segment. `Sink` is a logical representation of a single segment and can have multiple `FireHydrant` which could hold an `IncrementalIndex` in memory or a `QueryableIndex` in disk. Note that each of these `IncrementalIndex` or `QueryableIndex` is a part of the same segment and should be merged before it's pushed to deep storage. In `AppenderatorImpl.persistAll()`, it persists all parts of the segments in memory into disk. How the persist happens is, the \"main\" thread first [creates a new `FireHydrant` with a new `IncrementalIndex`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/master/server/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/segment/realtime/appenderator/AppenderatorImpl.java#L561), and then the \"persist\" thread [performs the persist in background](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/master/server/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/segment/realtime/appenderator/AppenderatorImpl.java#L579). As a result, when the \"main\" thread calls `AppenderatorImpl.add()` next time, the new row will be added to the new `Firehydrant` instead of the one which is being persisted.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/529728974/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/529743458","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/5340#issuecomment-529743458","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/5340","id":529743458,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyOTc0MzQ1OA==","user":{"login":"wc188996","id":12324219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzI0MjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12324219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wc188996","html_url":"https://github.com/wc188996","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wc188996/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wc188996/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wc188996/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wc188996/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wc188996/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wc188996/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wc188996/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wc188996/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wc188996/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-10T02:37:31Z","updated_at":"2019-09-10T02:37:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I have the same issue when using imply--2.8.20, My solution is increase the druid.processing.numThreads ,the path is imply-2.8.20/conf/druid/historical/runtime.properties.\r\nthe occurrence of this error is t0o many queries in one time, and not enough threads to work at this time.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/529743458/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/529783198","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/6578#issuecomment-529783198","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6578","id":529783198,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyOTc4MzE5OA==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-10T05:59:25Z","updated_at":"2019-09-10T05:59:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue has been closed due to lack of activity.

RC1 vote has been cancelled but will try to fix these up before RC2 sometime soon.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/530503889/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/530515024","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/8369#issuecomment-530515024","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8369","id":530515024,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMDUxNTAyNA==","user":{"login":"glasser","id":16724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glasser","html_url":"https://github.com/glasser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glasser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glasser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glasser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glasser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glasser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glasser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glasser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glasser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glasser/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-11T18:48:57Z","updated_at":"2019-09-11T18:48:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks!
