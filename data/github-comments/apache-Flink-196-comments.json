There are two things I would like to improve, though:\r\n\r\n  1. Relying on `hashCode()` makes very implicit assumptions about the behavior of the hash code implementation. This does not really document/articulate well how critical this `int` value that we rely on is. For example, by Java specification, hashCode may vary between processes - it only needs to be stable within a single JVM. Our hash code implementation happens to be stable currently, as long as the JDK does not change the implementation of the String hash code method (which they could in theory do in any minor release, although they have not done that in a while).\r\n\r\n  2. It is crucial that the distribution of partitions is uniform. That is a bit harder to guarantee when all sources pick up their own set of topics. At the least, distribution should be uniform of the partitions within a topic. For example, the topic defines \"where to start\" in the parallel subtasks, and the partitions then go \"round robin\".\r\nWell, as it happens, this is actually the implementation of the hash code function, but again, this looks a bit like it \"coincidentally\" behaves like that, rather than that we have a strict contract for that behavior. For example, changing the hashCode from `31 * topic + partition` to `31 * partition + topic` results in non-uniform distribution, but is an equally valid hashCode.\r\n\r\nI would suggest to have a function `int assignmentIndex()` or so, for which we define the above contract. We should also have tests that this distributes partitions within a single topic uniform.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/314562140/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/314573997","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4233#issuecomment-314573997","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4233","id":314573997,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNDU3Mzk5Nw==","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-11T21:14:28Z","updated_at":"2017-07-11T21:14:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've reworked the \"misc\" group.

Your suggestion makes a lot of sense.\r\n\r\nI've fixed this up as the following:\r\n\r\n- Have a new method `KafkaTopicPartitionAssigner.assign(KafkaTopicPartition partition, int numSubtasks)` that defines a strict contract, such that when locally used by subtasks to filter out partitions, the resulting distribution of the partitions of a single topic are guaranteed to be:\r\n  1. Uniformly distributed across subtasks\r\n  2. Partitions are round-robin distributed (strictly CLOCKWISE w.r.t. ascending subtask indices) by using the partition id as the offset from a starting index determined using the topic name. The extra directional contract actually makes this more stricter than what we had before (originally, we may be round-robin assigning partitions counter-clockwise). This should make the actual assignment scheme much more predictable as perceived by the user, since they just need to know the start index of a specific topic to understand how the partitions of the topic are distributed across subtasks. We could add some log that states the start index of the topics it is consuming.\r\n\r\n- Strengthen the tests in `KafkaConsumerPartitionAssignmentTest` to test this contract. Uniform distribution was already tested in that suite of tests, the change makes the tests also verify the \"clockwise round-robin since some start index\" contract.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/314767037/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/314770637","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4279#issuecomment-314770637","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4279","id":314770637,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNDc3MDYzNw==","user":{"login":"sunjincheng121","id":22488084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDg4MDg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22488084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121","html_url":"https://github.com/sunjincheng121","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-12T13:35:09Z","updated_at":"2017-07-12T13:35:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"merging ...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/314770637/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/314771896","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4233#issuecomment-314771896","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4233","id":314771896,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNDc3MTg5Ng==","user":{"login":"greghogan","id":569655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2OTY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/569655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan","html_url":"https://github.com/greghogan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-12T13:39:30Z","updated_at":"2017-07-12T13:39:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1;

It's an end-to-end exactly-once test for the case where Flink source subtask count > partition count.\r\n\r\nRegarding `ListState`:\r\nThe redistribution of `ListState` doesn't conflict with discovery and assignment of partitions in the `release-1.3` case (where there is no partition discovery), because we don't respect the partition assignment logic if we're starting from savepoints. We only consider whatever is in the restored state. See also @aljoscha's comment above, which is related to this.\r\n\r\nFor `master` where partition discovery is already merged, the `ListState` is a union list state, where all subtasks are broadcasted with all partition states.
