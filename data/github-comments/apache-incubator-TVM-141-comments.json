The tuning loop now looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef tune_kernels(tasks,\r\n                 n_trial,\r\n                 config_library,\r\n                 measure_option,\r\n                 log_filename='tuning.log'):\r\n\r\n    # Create a tuning job and point it at a config library\r\n    job = TuningJob(\r\n        log_filename,\r\n        target,\r\n        config_library=config_library,\r\n    )\r\n    # Use the tuning job during the tuning loop\r\n    with job:\r\n        for i, tsk in enumerate(tasks):\r\n            prefix = \"[Task %2d/%2d] \" % (i+1, len(tasks))\r\n\r\n            # Convert conv2d tasks to conv2d_NCHWc tasks\r\n            task = autotvm.task.create(\"topi_x86_conv2d_NCHWc\", args=tsk.args,\r\n                                       target=target, template_key='direct')\r\n            task.workload = tsk.workload\r\n\r\n            # Create tuner\r\n            tuner_obj = GridSearchTuner(task)\r\n\r\n            # Do tuning - the tuner will skip tasks which have already been tuned\r\n            # in the config library\r\n            tuner_obj.tune(\r\n                n_trial=n_trial,\r\n                early_stopping=n_trial,\r\n                measure_option=measure_option,\r\n                callbacks=[autotvm.callback.progress_bar(n_trial, prefix=prefix)],\r\n            )\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing 'with job' puts the job into the global tuning scope. The job will then automatically register it's own callback to the tuners and a new tuner method `load_library` is called if the TuningJob has a ConfigLibrary attached. This is where the resume logic can be implemented. Currently I have only implemented the basic logic to skip completed tasks, but it should be possible to implement more advanced resume logic fairly easily as you have access to the full ConfigLibrary.\r\n\r\nIf you don't specify a ConfigLibrary with a job, it will just log all the results to the specified log file.\r\n\r\nConfig files are indexed within the library by target, so to use configs from the library you can simply do `with config_library.load(target):`. This just returns ApplyHistoryBest, it doesn't implement a new DispatchContext.\r\n \r\nI've updated my PR (https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/pull/4151) accordingly. Note that the PR does not include every feature discussed here but is intended as initial infrastructure on top of which more advanced features can be developed.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/552982585/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/552986036","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4303#issuecomment-552986036","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4303","id":552986036,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1Mjk4NjAzNg==","user":{"login":"abergeron","id":1002504,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDI1MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1002504?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron","html_url":"https://github.com/abergeron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-12T16:59:31Z","updated_at":"2019-11-12T16:59:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I

Here is a short summary of the current runtime after your suggestions:\r\n\r\n* The runtime takes only one .so file including host and external kernels.\r\n* The runtime is now unified with `DSOModule` so backend developers don't need to implement their own runtime (and `GetFunction`) anymore. Instead, they need to unpack `TVMValue` in the generated kernels.\r\n* The [example](https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/pull/4280/files#diff-aab1542f9a9fec245df5ae78088f43ffR253) in this PR demonstrates a case that user backend will generate third-party library calls. This is applicable to runtime-less libraries such as MKL-DNN.\r\n* For the external backend that has a runtime engine such as TRT, we can still codegen external functions like [this example](https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/pull/4280/files#diff-aab1542f9a9fec245df5ae78088f43ffR27), construct the subgraph in that function, and invoke the TRT engine to execute it on the fly.\r\n\r\nWe will refine the other codegen PR based on this one after merging.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/553048433/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/553063878","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4308#issuecomment-553063878","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4308","id":553063878,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MzA2Mzg3OA==","user":{"login":"kevinthesun","id":15520525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTIwNTI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15520525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinthesun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-12T19:06:15Z","updated_at":"2019-11-12T19:06:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tqchen It looks like tvm floordiv/mod only allows integer?

This kind of example will be closer to what people want, especially they want to serialize states that are other than sequence of API calls. @zhiics\r\n\r\nI've added another example that mimics the graph-runtime-like programming model. This example assumes the external backend has its own runtime that accepts a graph representation such as JSON. Accordingly, the codegen would serialize the subgraph to a string like this [code snippet](https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/pull/4280/files#diff-aab1542f9a9fec245df5ae78088f43ffR128-R131) (I use a very simple representation instead of a complete JSON format in this example for simplification).
