Hi @lhotari do you think this could fix an issue with a blocking `pulsarConsumer.batchReceive()` while using a `BatchReceivePolicy` with a timeout set ? I set a timeout to 250ms but it may fail to return after waiting for 60s.\r\n\r\n@e-marchand-exensa The problem is that `Consumer.batchReceive` doesn't currently provide a way to set the timeout for a batchReceive call. The  `BatchReceivePolicy` controls the batch creation, but when no messages are received, the timeout will have no impact on a batchReceive call. With the #8326 changes, it's possible to set the timeout for batchReceiveAsync call in JDK 9+, for example:\r\n```\r\nCompletableFuture<Messages<?>> batchResult = consumer.batchReceiveAsync().orTimeout(250, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);\r\n```\r\nThis means that there is a workaround for your problem when using the async API (the improvement will be available in 2.6.2 release) and JDK9+ (which brings the `orTimeout` method to CompletableFuture). \r\n\r\nFor the non-async API, I'd suggest creating a feature request for adding `batchReceive(int timeout, TimeUnit unit)` to `org.apache.pulsar.client.api.Consumer`. There's current `receive(int timeout, TimeUnit unit)` so it would make sense to have a similar method for `batchReceive`. I noticed that you have already created #7696 . However I think that having a timeout for batchReceive method is a new feature and is not something that should or is controlled by BatchReceivePolicy. Therefore creating a new feature request would be a way to proceed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/716471985/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/716472993","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/8256#issuecomment-716472993","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/8256","id":716472993,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxNjQ3Mjk5Mw==","user":{"login":"congbobo184","id":39078850,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MDc4ODUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39078850?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/congbobo184","html_url":"https://github.com/congbobo184","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/congbobo184/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/congbobo184/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/congbobo184/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/congbobo184/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/congbobo184/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/congbobo184/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/congbobo184/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/congbobo184/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/congbobo184/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-26T10:59:14Z","updated_at":"2020-10-26T10:59:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"/pulsarbot

, thanks for your inputs.\r\n\r\n> The problem is that `Consumer.batchReceive` doesn't currently provide a way to set the timeout for a batchReceive call. The `BatchReceivePolicy` controls the batch creation, but when no messages are received, the timeout will have no impact on a batchReceive call.\r\n\r\nWow, that's not what I had supposed and do not match what I observe either. But may be I don't understand what you mean **exactly**. Most of my consumers does not receive any messages but still does not block indefinitely. It happens \"sometimes\" (in the closing process of my application) and I'm hard to reproduce the problem.\r\n\r\nAs a work around, I'm using `pulsarConsumer.batchReceiveAsync().get(int timeout, TimeUnit.unit)`, but a timeout in this case should **not** be an exception as it is totally normal to not get any message in a 250ms timeframe. I suppose `consumer.batchReceiveAsync().orTimeout(int timeout, TimeUnit unit)` imply the same semantic issue.\r\n\r\nYou are right about the need for a `batchReceive(int timeout, TimeUnit unit)` if the policy does not ensure this, but this case must made be clear in the policy documentation as I don't think it is the expected behavior for most users and it seems I still don't understand the current one.\r\n\r\nRegards,","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/716506358/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/716517573","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/8271#issuecomment-716517573","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/8271","id":716517573,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxNjUxNzU3Mw==","user":{"login":"KannarFr","id":7518245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MTgyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7518245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KannarFr","html_url":"https://github.com/KannarFr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KannarFr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KannarFr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KannarFr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KannarFr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KannarFr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KannarFr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KannarFr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KannarFr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KannarFr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-26T12:34:40Z","updated_at":"2020-10-26T12:34:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@315157973 already did it.
