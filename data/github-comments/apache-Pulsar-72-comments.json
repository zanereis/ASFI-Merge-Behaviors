also need rack-aware. in a simpler form to think about this is following:\r\n\r\n- Rack-Aware is good enough if your network topology only has one level (rack or availability zones)\r\n- Region-Aware is better if your network topology has multiple levels (e.g. /region/rack).\r\n\r\nIn this way, Rackware is good enough for AWS AZs
