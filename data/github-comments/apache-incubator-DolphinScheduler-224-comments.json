I speculate that adding status to `task` itself may solve the problem. For example, `waiting` and `pending`, `waiting` means that the `task` instance is newly created, and `pending` means that the pre execution logic is satisfied and attempts to push it to `worker`.\r\n> > > I suggest updating from `waiting` to `pending` and pushing the task to `worker` when preparing to push the task, so that users can realize that the task has met the execution conditions. If the `task` in `waiting` status fails to be pushed to `worker` for the first time, the error log can be printed and updated to `pending` status. After that, try again and again. If the `task` in the `pending` state fails to push, the log will not be output. When it succeeds, switch to the current execution state and output the corresponding success log.\r\n> > > Of course, how the underlying method of this logic call controls the log needs to be discussed.\r\n> > \r\n> > \r\n> > I think i can make this simple to understand.

just add `waitting suitable worker` state for dispatch is OK, because `fail to execute : ... due to no suitable worker, current task needs worker group ... to execute` print the most.\r\n\r\nWorker

I find current metrics are general statistics. Statistics of tasks and workflows are separated. We may need some metric like `task.duration.<workflow_id>.<task_id>` to monitor vital workflows/tasks more accurately. Of course, a side-effect is we will generate explosive number of metrics, leading to some performance issue. To avoid this, two methods will work:\r\n\r\n1. There will be some config for users to switch on/off generating metrics.\r\n2.
