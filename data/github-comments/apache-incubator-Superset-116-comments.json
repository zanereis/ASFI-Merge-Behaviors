The concepts of `until` and `since` are different from any other filter in Superset and the only ones I implemented. \r\n\r\nThat said, I thought about similar use cases before and there are some foundations you can use to do what you want to do.\r\n\r\nTake a look here:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/04680e5ff138f7113a3d655133307049bc91ff3d/superset/assets/javascripts/explore/components/controls/AnnotationLayer.jsx#L408\r\n\r\nThis line will override the `since` field of the annotation slice to use the `since` value of the current slice. The logic that does that is here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/04680e5ff138f7113a3d655133307049bc91ff3d/superset/assets/javascripts/chart/chartAction.js#L71\r\n\r\nNow, in order to implement what you described you will need to add something like this to the `AnnotationLayer`:\r\n```\r\nthis.setState({ overrides: { ...overrides, filters: [\r\n  { col: timeColumn, op: '>', val: :  'since' },\r\n  { col: intervalEndColumn, op: '<', val: :  'until' },\r\n] } });\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd make changes to the `chartAction` that appends/transforms the filters correctly. This will be pretty tricky to get working in a flexible way.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/357437504/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/357471453","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/4189#issuecomment-357471453","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/4189","id":357471453,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NzQ3MTQ1Mw==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-13T22:15:36Z","updated_at":"2018-01-13T22:15:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"It's not ideal to have many issues into one.

@mistercrunch ,\r\n\r\nActually, we have used docker based workflow for developing and deploying customized superset for more than half a year and it works great in both developers local machine and for simple deployment just use a modified `docker-compose.yml` in single machine for normal use. So I propose this PR just want to see if anybody have some interest and get some suggestions.\r\n\r\nFor the documentation, I can provide more if you think this is OK, and I'll explain some details about the basic workflow for development, some tips to make docker behaves like your local machine without too much code copy and folder share, and real experience about how to use docker-compose to manage different superset environment, like from local development environment, to testing, staging, and finally production environment.\r\n\r\nThe reason about why I contribute this PR to the main repo is I think there should be a faster way to newbies to set up an dev environment for superset. With this PR, new comers can just get a workable/reproducable superset dev workflow in minutes instead of hours. So I enable port mapping, like exposing redis and postgres port directly from docker to host, so you can use most of your familiar redis/postgres to facilitate the dev process.\r\n\r\nAnd about `superset_config.py`, when I propose this PR, I don't want to modify the default `config.py`, so I put some example code to `superset_config.py` and do a `git add -f`, yeah, this is intentional. And we think that use environment variables to configure and inject config to runtime system is a very good idea from https://12factor.net/config. Or I think I can put the code to `config.py` directly, first check whether the necessary environment variable exists, if not, then return back to the original default way in `config.py`.\r\n\r\nAbout whether we should put `docker-compose.yml` to another repo, I think it's possible, just like many other project does. And I can provide `docker-compose` settings for production environment if you like. But right now, for simplicity, I think a simple `docker-compose.yml` in main repo for developers to get on board is enough.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/358903565/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/358907865","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/4244#issuecomment-358907865","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/4244","id":358907865,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1ODkwNzg2NQ==","user":{"login":"williaster","id":4496521,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0OTY1MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4496521?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster","html_url":"https://github.com/williaster","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-19T09:10:53Z","updated_at":"2018-01-19T09:10:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM
