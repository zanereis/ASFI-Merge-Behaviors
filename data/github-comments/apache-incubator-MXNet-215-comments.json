is probably a question for Spark itself, not MXNet. The SVM you are referring to is in the old MLlib package, which is deprecated. The optimizer on it can be changed yes, but if you look at the type signatures it needs to extend the `Optimizer` class defined in MLlib. So you'd have to wrap the MXNet optimizers in an `Optimizer` class. I doubt that would be worth your time. SGD on Spark does not work well. The new ML package has a `LinearSVC` which uses quasi-newton methods which will be better on Spark.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I think this issue should be closed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/316844723/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/316856085","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/4173#issuecomment-316856085","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/4173","id":316856085,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNjg1NjA4NQ==","user":{"login":"imranshaikmuma","id":24683611,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjgzNjEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24683611?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imranshaikmuma","html_url":"https://github.com/imranshaikmuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imranshaikmuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imranshaikmuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imranshaikmuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imranshaikmuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imranshaikmuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imranshaikmuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imranshaikmuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imranshaikmuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imranshaikmuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-20T23:11:45Z","updated_at":"2017-07-20T23:17:42Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"is this still open? what is the progress? does keras has api for mxnet now?\r\ni dont see in keras documentation.
