I resubmit it, In order to satisfy CheckStyle's check, the code has been formatted a lot and may be emm difficult to read....\r\n\r\n- **Why the owner field can't worked as expected？**\r\n  - In pr: #4442,  a new filed owner was introduced to display who owns the resource.  In my opinion, the implementation in the pr is incorrect. The join query in the db sql can get the correct username, but in the ResourceMapper, the Resource class is used to construct the data returned by the db query.  Please note that the Resource class does not have a userName field, which results in that the userName can't be actually thereturned to front end.\r\n    I simulated the modification of this pr in my environment, which confirms what I said above\r\n  - in pr: #4947 This pr is mainly to solve some obvious slow query problems, but the join query about username does not feel like a bottleneck. The join query was completely removed, which resulted in the username can't be seen in the sql.\r\n  \r\n- **My Solution**\r\n  I  try to solve this is to add a `userName` in `Resource`, and add a annotation `@TableField(exist = false)`\r\n  Operations like `listPaging` and `update` all require  a username field.  **I didn't introduce a wrapper class like DTO to solve this problem because I'm worried that it would make the code look too complicated to maintain.**\r\n\r\n@CalvinKirs  @ruanwenjun  any good idea?  I'm not sure if I'm on the right path.
