Hopefully you could provide more details about your design.\r\n\r\nActually it's like the remote message escape mechanism. When discarding messages, Rocket MQ puts messages into **RMQ_SYS_TRANS_CHECK_MAX_TIME_TOPIC**, which is a not allowed to send topic in topic validator. For the remote escape of these messages, first wrap them in their origin topic with **transaction check time**, and send it to other master broker. As messages bring **PROPERTY_TRANSACTION_CHECK_TIMES** with them, master broker received these message first put them into half topic queue and discard them in next check.\r\n应丢弃的消息逃逸机制和正常消息的逃逸机制相似。为了避免**RMQ_SYS_TRANS_CHECK_MAX_TIME_TOPIC**远程不可写的限制，首先将半消息用原Topic包装，此时消息仍携带**PROPERTY_TRANSACTION_CHECK_TIMES**属性，然后再投递到远程主节点上。收到消息的主节点将消息放入半消息队列**RMQ_SYS_TRANS_HALF_TOPIC**等待检查，在下一次检查中，将消息丢弃。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1150619769/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1150620874","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/4428#issuecomment-1150620874","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/4428","id":1150620874,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl85ElRTK","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-09T03:11:31Z","updated_at":"2022-06-09T03:11:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#
