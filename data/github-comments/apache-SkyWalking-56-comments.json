review the code of agent, the cause of testcase (#1632 and #1740) failed is in those `Instrucmentation`are : they try to enhance parent method, if we only enhance the method declare, we can solve this problem fundamentally.\r\nexample for above problem:\r\nin `org.apache.skywalking.apm.plugin.spring.resttemplate.sync.define.RestTemplateInstrumentation`\r\nwe try to enhance 3 methods of class `org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate`,`doExecute`,`handleResponse`,`createRequest`,structure is \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11530760/48339089-3ac6d600-e6a2-11e8-9685-470e618884ab.png)\r\n\r\nin pr #1632 and #1740 ,due to limit the enhance scope by declare method ,so all plugins which have this usage will test failure.\r\n\r\nso I have a bold attempt ，update these plugins to fit `declared method` by \r\n`org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate`==>`doExecute`,`handleResponse`\r\n`org.springframework.http.client.support.HttpAccessor`==>`createRequest`\r\n\r\nbut this make these plugin more complex.\r\n\r\n#### so do you have any good solutions?\r\n\r\nactually this pr only copy parent annotations to child and copy method.so `@RequestBody` can work well.an example below:\r\nsource files:\r\nParentController.java\r\n```java\r\n@RestController\r\n@RequestMapping(\"parent\")\r\npublic class ParentController {\r\n\r\n    @GetMapping(\"a\")\r\n    public String a(Integer b) {\r\n        return \"parent-a\" + b;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nChildController.java\r\n```java\r\n@RestController\r\n@RequestMapping(\"child\")\r\npublic class ChildController extends ParentController {\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwe use 3 ways to show what byte buddy do to `ChildController`(the result is auto generated by byte buddy by using debugging tool):\r\n# 1.In release version way:\r\n```java\r\n@RestController\r\n@RequestMapping({\"child\"})\r\npublic class ChildController extends ParentController {\r\n    public ChildController() {\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public String a(Integer var1) {\r\n        return (String)delegate$a2v8n91.intercept(this, new Object[]{var1}, new ChildController$auxiliary$j6MQIJz8(this, var1), cachedValue$HqrmDcRg$3v0urg0);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n  ....\r\n}\r\n``` \r\n\r\n# 2.In this pr way( actually this also doesn't work in spring(request parm binding failed) ,if parmeter is `@RequestBody` no problem):\r\n```java\r\n@RestController\r\n@RequestMapping({\"child\"})\r\npublic class ChildController extends ParentController {\r\n    public ChildController() {\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @RequestMapping(\r\n        name = \"\",\r\n        value = {\"a\"},\r\n        path = {},\r\n        method = {},\r\n        params = {},\r\n        headers = {},\r\n        consumes = {},\r\n        produces = {}\r\n    )\r\n    public String a(Integer var1) {\r\n        return (String)delegate$a2v8n91.intercept(this, new Object[]{var1}, new ChildController$auxiliary$j6MQIJz8(this, var1), cachedValue$HqrmDcRg$3v0urg0);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n  ....\r\n```\r\n\r\n# 3.In #1632 and #1740 way\r\n```java\r\n@RestController\r\n@RequestMapping({\"child\"})\r\npublic class ChildController extends ParentController {\r\n    public ChildController() {\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nso the third is most correct for source file.that the reason I want to only  enhance the declared method.😄\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/437822347/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/437823574","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/1875#issuecomment-437823574","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/1875","id":437823574,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNzgyMzU3NA==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-12T10:05:16Z","updated_at":"2018-11-12T10:05:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@candyleer
