It is a good point that ds should have some alert mechanism in case `alert-server` fails itself. May I ask how do u want to improve the availability of `alert-server`? Are u planning to enable users to deploy multiple alert-servers?\r\n> > \r\n> > \r\n> > hi, Because I just started looking at the code, limited to ability, my idea is\r\n> > \r\n> > 1. Give the power to deploy multiple alert-servers to users, and we are only responsible for ensuring that they will not send duplicate information;\r\n> > 2. Send email to users in the fatal errors we catch as much as possible;\r\n> > \r\n> > Because in the process of using it, I found that it stopped serving, but didn't tell me it was leaving\r\n> \r\n> @zhongjiajie @SbloodyS I saw there are tables related to alerting in ds metaDB. Just for double-check, if alert-server fails for some reason and restarted later, during the failure, will alerts still get stored in db and sent as soon as alert-server restarts?\r\n\r\nYes. The alert service consumes very few resources. So i recommand the following two ways to ensure production stability:\r\n1. Deploying alert server in a single instance.\r\n2. Using systemd or supervisor to manage the process of ```alert-server```. @iamliangdi
