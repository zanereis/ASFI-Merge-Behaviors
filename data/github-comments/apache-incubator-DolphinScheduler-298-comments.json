I agree with your point. \r\n1. I think that the current `spark version` on ui is kind of **misleading**. Users may be concerned that DS does not support `spark 3.x.x`. I have seen people asking whether DS supports spark3 , even if there is a description for this problem in the DS [documentation](https://dolphinscheduler.apache.org/en-us/docs/dev/user_doc/guide/installation/kubernetes.html) (but users will not find this description easily) as below:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"811\" alt=\"截屏2022-09-09 09 55 13\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38122586/189256318-8c9cbd85-a6db-4662-981b-57df74774136.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Even if DS needs to support multiple sparks, I don't think setting `SPARK_HOME1` and `SPARK_HOME2` is an elegant way. What if the user needs to support 3 or more sparks?\r\n\r\n3.

Search before asking\n\n- [X] I had searched in the [issues](https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues?q=is%3Aissue) and found no similar issues.\n\n\n### What happened\n\nexceptions is thrown while running UpgradeDolphinScheduler with profle 'upgrade':\r\n- Duplicate key exceptions are thrown when upgrading mysql-meta-data by executing ver. 2.0.3~ver. 2.0.4 dolphinscheduler_ddl.sql\r\n,like this:\r\n![图片](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49931055/189272645-cd628602-738c-4e6b-98f8-72f081255031.png)\r\n\r\n- An exception occurred while dropping an index that does not exist by executing ver. 3.1.0 dolphinscheduler_ddl.sql \r\n![图片](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49931055/189273321-86f12dfc-9ff2-48a3-a08c-83ab228c9fe8.png)\r\n\r\n- Duplicate column exceptions are thrown when upgrading mysql-meta-data by executing ver. 3.1.1 dolphinscheduler_ddl.sql\r\n,such as :\r\n![图片](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49931055/189273593-7bea2180-3c70-4f87-944f-902218cef518.png)\r\n\r\n\n\n### What you expected to happen\n\nI think the upgrade process is important and shouldn't have any exceptions, and appended upgrade processes must take into account the case of duplicates of indexes or columns or tables\n\n### How to reproduce\n\nI recommend defining mysql procedures to determine whether an index or column already exists, and if it exists, delete it and then create a new one;\r\n\r\nthen exception dropping an index that does not exist occurs because of a sql logic error and easy to fix it;\r\n![图片](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49931055/189274463-b8dd4159-bcb2-4023-87fc-1a792aa4ab80.png)\r\n\n\n### Anything else\n\nI recommend that subsequent versions of the mysql sql script also need to avoid these exceptions\n\n### Version\n\ndev\n\n### Are you willing to submit PR?\n\n- [X] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\n### Code of

@caishunfeng My current situation is that there is a network card with dual IPs, one of which can communicate with me locally, and the other cannot. If you do not specify ip in this method, if you obtain it in other methods, you can only obtain the corresponding network card, and through this network card, you may obtain an IP that cannot be connected. When I get the wrong IP, I can't connect to the wrong IP locally, because it is not in a switch, which will cause the log to fail to query\r\n\r\nOK, I get your point now. So the specify worker ip is just designed for more than one ip in a network card. \r\nBut I think this is a problem of network setting, not the problem for ds. There should be other better ways to solve it, such as using Intranet host instead of IP,
