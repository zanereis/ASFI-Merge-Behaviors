We keep statistics at the shard level that allow for efficient skipping of rows, but there's a bit of subtlety in computing the correct number of rows to skip in each shard of a database comprised of multiple shards. I sketched a solution to the problem in JIRA several years ago:\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/COUCHDB-2784\r\n\r\nQuoting here:\r\n\r\n> For a database with Q shards and a request specifying ?skip=X We know that either a) at least one of the shards will end skipping at least `X / Q` rows, or b) the entire response body will be empty. So, I propose the following:\r\n> 1. Set the per-shard skip value to `X div Q`\r\n>     - If a shard has fewer than `X div Q` rows remaining it should send its last row\r\n>     - If `X div Q` is zero we can short-circuit and just use the current algorithm.\r\n> 1. The coordinator sorts the first responses from each shard. It then sends the key of the row that sorts first (let's call it Foo) back to all the shards\r\n> 1. Each shard counts the number of rows in between the original startkey and Foo and sends that number, then starts streaming with Foo as the new startkey\r\n> 1. The coordinator deducts the computed per-shard skip values from the user-specified skip and then takes care of the remainder in the usual way we do it today (i.e. by consuming the rows as they come in).\r\n>\r\n> [T]he algorithm could be executed recursively, e.g. if after one pass we're still left trying to consume a million rows in the coordinator we can farm that out to the shards again and identify an even better start key (Foo 2.0). Lather, rinse, repeat until the number of rows that would be consumed by the coordinator is acceptably small.\r\n\r\nIt's a moderately complex patch, and won't apply to 4.0. Efficient skips might be possible in 4.0 but it depends a bit on what sorts of statistics we might maintain in any index data structures we implement over FoundationDB (FDB itself doesn't provide any).\r\n\r\nI think we have a documentation bug here; we imply that large values of `skip` are fast for any release after 1.2, when it's really only fast for 1.x where x>2.

Technically the '+' is a valid character in userinfo part. This means a password which had a '+' in it, like say \"a+b\" used to work just fine now will fail because we'd decode into \"a b\". This probably means we'd have to make our own unquoting logic and excluding the '+' sign from it at least.\r\n\r\nAnother issue is passwords which had '%HH` sequence where 'H' is any hex digit would also be decoded into something which will not match the original password. Not sure how serious one one would be. Maybe we document it and ask users to double-check their replications after the upgrade. Or perhaps have config option to let uses opt out of using decoding for the userinfo part like we did in previous issues too.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was prompted by the @flimzy's findings in the related issue https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/3565","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/841862668/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/841866009","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/3565#issuecomment-841866009","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/3565","id":841866009,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0MTg2NjAwOQ==","user":{"login":"nickva","id":211822,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTgyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/211822?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva","html_url":"https://github.com/nickva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-16T19:33:41Z","updated_at":"2021-05-16T19:34:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think it's coming from mochiweb were it calls [unquote]( https://github.com/mochi/mochiweb/blob/070594e4d66163d662ac7e3bfb75dadcc922dd7c/src/mochiweb_request.erl#L214) on the path but it actually uses the [unquote_plus](https://github.com/mochi/mochiweb/blob/070594e4d66163d662ac7e3bfb75dadcc922dd7c/src/mochiweb_util.erl#L256-L257) decoding logic where a `+` would be turned into a space. \r\n\r\nRecently we encountered a somewhat similar issue with userinfo decoding/decoding in replicator in https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/3546.

I don't like it but not a deal breaker compared to other benefits\r\n\r\n * In general I would prefer 80 columns (that is configurable `erlfmt --print-width=80`) but if most people would want to stick with the default 100 that's ok too. It seems, based on how case nesting is reformatted (always indented with 4 spaces) some places like auth handlers end up being squished to the right even with 100 columns. With 80 it would be worse so I can live with 100 columns.\r\n\r\n * I don't like the spacing between functions as much, I prefer one line between function head clauses, and two lines between functions. However, if erlfmt means having consistency I am ok sticking with erlfmt's way.\r\n\r\nBased on @iilyak's scale (-5...+2), I'd go with +1 as an average of my choices. But also think we should wait perhaps until erlfmt reaches 1.0 and maybe gather more feedback (possibly with a post on dev@couchdb?). Also wonder if there any chance convincing erlfmt authors to change their mind about a few of the most disliked features here such as `->` being on its own line.\r\n\r\nAnother issue is being able to cherry-pick commits between `3.x` and `main`. We have two recent PRs, for example, (Erlang 24 support and a pending one for moving chttpd/httpd settings around) that would apply neatly to both branches, but if we reformat one branch those won't apply as easily. Not a deal breaker, but perhaps we would run erlfmt on both main and 3.x at the same time and maybe coordinating with pending PR authors.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/842569320/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/844025759","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/3565#issuecomment-844025759","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/3565","id":844025759,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0NDAyNTc1OQ==","user":{"login":"bessbd","id":9086834,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwODY4MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9086834?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bessbd","html_url":"https://github.com/bessbd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bessbd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bessbd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bessbd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bessbd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bessbd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bessbd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bessbd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bessbd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bessbd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-19T11:48:45Z","updated_at":"2021-05-19T11:48:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think this is a duplicate of https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/2235","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/844025759/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/844026225","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/3565#issuecomment-844026225","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/3565","id":844026225,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0NDAyNjIyNQ==","user":{"login":"bessbd","id":9086834,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwODY4MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9086834?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bessbd","html_url":"https://github.com/bessbd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bessbd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bessbd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bessbd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bessbd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bessbd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bessbd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bessbd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bessbd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bessbd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-19T11:49:40Z","updated_at":"2021-05-19T11:49:40Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Maybe it's time to fix this :D ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/844026225/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/844039917","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/3569#issuecomment-844039917","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/3569","id":844039917,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0NDAzOTkxNw==","user":{"login":"iilyak","id":9804420,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MDQ0MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9804420?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iilyak","html_url":"https://github.com/iilyak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iilyak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iilyak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iilyak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iilyak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iilyak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iilyak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iilyak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iilyak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iilyak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-19T12:07:28Z","updated_at":"2021-05-19T12:07:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This solution doesn't match the proposal in the https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/3560.

Oh good question. \r\n\r\nI think it should always be the last commit unknown result because as soon as there is at least one `commit_unknown_result` in the sequence of retries, we will always try to return that result to the user, and not run the transaction closure again https://github.com/apache/couchdb/blob/e5699e5c10bd0131ab9fe3a04bcc1568c1a16186/src/fabric/src/fabric2_fdb.erl#L186\r\n\r\nBut when we try to return the last result we still have to perform a few FDB operations which would also be an area where retries would be thrown, for example here

No longer tested, but should work.\r\n```\r\n\r\nBasically saying we're not going to go out of our way to break it but it may break at some point accidentally and we're not testing it. With `ceil` the idea I think was that a failed compilation error would indicate that it obviously won't build. In retrospect, we should have taken a firmer stance and explicitly indicated we are not supporting Erlang versions < 20 in documentation at that point.\r\n\r\nI already updated the rebar config file to disallow Erlang 19 and will update the dependencies list in unix.html docs file too.\r\n\r\nAs for which versions to try. The binary packages we release are shipped with the latest versions of 20. In production at Cloudant I have seen 20 run for a few years without any issues. So could pick 20.3.8.26 for example. However, the downside there is Erlang developers promise to support only the last two versions behind the current one. If that's a concern perhaps pick the latest patch version of 23 and make sure to periodically check for fixes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/856052942/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/856153924","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/3571#issuecomment-856153924","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/3571","id":856153924,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg1NjE1MzkyNA==","user":{"login":"wohali","id":112292,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjI5Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112292?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali","html_url":"https://github.com/wohali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-07T18:13:36Z","updated_at":"2021-06-07T18:13:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Note that 23.x and 24.x are not yet supported in CouchDB 3, unless you are building from the `3.x` branch directly.

@awalterschulze after playing around in an editor with some erlfmt formatted CouchDB code, I find it all pretty readable, and generally an improvement, with only one real exception. CouchDB style has evolved to put a blank line between function clauses, and 2 blank lines between functions. After formatting, these get changed to no 0 and 1 respectively. I wonder if your team would consider respecting the original format for this case as well as [the others you already honor here](https://github.com/WhatsApp/erlfmt#respecting-original-format)?\r\n\r\nThank you @jaydoane it is really great to hear that you find erlfmt to be a general improvement.\r\n\r\nSorry for taking so long to get back to you, but we needed to give this some thought.\r\nThe problem with preserving the spacing for this case though, is it would result in a lot of inconsistency caused by users.\r\nIf anything this would need to be an enforced style, but that would need to be configured and erlfmt does not to config.\r\nWe want erlfmt to enforce an opinionated style.\r\nWe did consider this format before as the opinionated style, as we very much liked this idea from Elixir.\r\nBut we found this style is uncommon in most erlang code bases.\r\nI hope that makes sense.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/859479642/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/859705863","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/3308#issuecomment-859705863","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/3308","id":859705863,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg1OTcwNTg2Mw==","user":{"login":"nickva","id":211822,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTgyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/211822?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva","html_url":"https://github.com/nickva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-11T16:39:17Z","updated_at":"2021-06-11T16:47:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"As far as db / doc not found, I think error reason is already provided:\r\n\r\n```\r\n % http $DB/mydb2/doc4\r\nHTTP/1.1 404 Object Not Found\r\n\r\n{\r\n    \"error\": \"not_found\",\r\n    \"reason\": \"Database does not exist.\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n% http $DB/mydb1/doc2\r\nHTTP/1.1 404 Object Not Found\r\n\r\n{\r\n    \"error\": \"not_found\",\r\n    \"reason\": \"missing\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs for `dbseq=true` we have a similar idea already with the `local_seq=true` parameter:\r\n```\r\n% http $DB/mydb1/doc1'?local_seq=true'\r\n\r\n{\r\n    \"_id\": \"doc1\",\r\n    \"_local_seq\": \"00000008d5c93d5a00000000\",\r\n    \"_rev\": \"1-4b8a35d3f70a5962f86c6dd06ceb599c\",\r\n    \"a\": \"b\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe return the doc update sequence along with a body.
