Not sure if we should really keep all the steps in `g.V(1).outE('knows').hasLabel('created').more().bla()`. It's like the Java compiler would keep stuff within a `if (false) { ... }` block. The static analysis already tells us, that nothing will make it through the filter.\n\nYou already treat this particular case in a dedicated code block, why not remove everything that comes after it and append a `.not(identity())`?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/260695736/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/260696196","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/495#issuecomment-260696196","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/495","id":260696196,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MDY5NjE5Ng==","user":{"login":"okram","id":148925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODkyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/148925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram","html_url":"https://github.com/okram","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-15T16:46:42Z","updated_at":"2016-11-15T16:46:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"We could.

Therefore, the GLV should be able to use any remote connection as long as it complies with the API. But, since pre-Python3 doesn't have any standard implementation of a `Future`, in order to maintain this \"plugablity\", IMO the GLV should be able to handle whatever type of `Future` the `RemoteConnection` returns. This places the onus on the end user to understand what `RemoteConnection` implementation they are using and the type of Future returned in order to comply with the syntax required by underlying framework implementation. This does not mean that responses need have a different API, only that developers know how to either `yield` or `yield from` them, or use the `concurrent.futures.as_completed` method. \n\nThe good thing is that the three possible future types (asyncio, tornado, and concurrent) have compatible APIs, and should be able to all be handled by the GLV in the same fashion. However, if I understand correctly (not sure that I do) it seems to me that doing specialized handling, would require us to commit to a certain syntax. Unfortunately, all of these problems really stem from the Python community's unwillingness to drop the legacy Python implementation, which the Python Software Foundation has been urging us to do for years. If I am missing something, or there is a solution that I can't see for some reason, please provide an example of a way that allows any pluggable `RemoteConnection` that can be based on any of the possible Python frameworks that maintain the syntax used for handling the resulting future by the end user.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/260989010/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/261124257","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/496#issuecomment-261124257","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/496","id":261124257,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTEyNDI1Nw==","user":{"login":"dkuppitz","id":572377,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjM3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/572377?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz","html_url":"https://github.com/dkuppitz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-17T01:08:22Z","updated_at":"2016-11-17T01:08:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Isn't  the `DOCKER_OPTS` environment variable used by default?

Killing the process didn't lead to any unexpected behavior.\n\nNext I installed the service as a real system service (I may have overlooked it, but I believe this is not mentioned in the docs):\n\n```\ndaniel@cube ~ $ sudo update-rc.d -f gremlin-server defaults\n Adding system startup for /etc/init.d/gremlin-server ...\n   /etc/rc0.d/K20gremlin-server -> ../init.d/gremlin-server\n   /etc/rc1.d/K20gremlin-server -> ../init.d/gremlin-server\n   /etc/rc6.d/K20gremlin-server -> ../init.d/gremlin-server\n   /etc/rc2.d/S20gremlin-server -> ../init.d/gremlin-server\n   /etc/rc3.d/S20gremlin-server -> ../init.d/gremlin-server\n   /etc/rc4.d/S20gremlin-server -> ../init.d/gremlin-server\n   /etc/rc5.d/S20gremlin-server -> ../init.d/gremlin-server\ndaniel@cube ~ $ sudo update-rc.d -f gremlin-server enable\nupdate-rc.d: warning:  start runlevel arguments (none) do not match gremlin-server Default-Start values (2 3 4 5)\nupdate-rc.d: warning:  stop runlevel arguments (none) do not match gremlin-server Default-Stop values (0 1 6)\n Enabling system startup links for /etc/init.d/gremlin-server ...\n Removing any system startup links for /etc/init.d/gremlin-server ...\n   /etc/rc0.d/K20gremlin-server\n   /etc/rc1.d/K20gremlin-server\n   /etc/rc2.d/S20gremlin-server\n   /etc/rc3.d/S20gremlin-server\n   /etc/rc4.d/S20gremlin-server\n   /etc/rc5.d/S20gremlin-server\n   /etc/rc6.d/K20gremlin-server\n Adding system startup for /etc/init.d/gremlin-server ...\n   /etc/rc0.d/K20gremlin-server -> ../init.d/gremlin-server\n   /etc/rc1.d/K20gremlin-server -> ../init.d/gremlin-server\n   /etc/rc6.d/K20gremlin-server -> ../init.d/gremlin-server\n   /etc/rc2.d/S20gremlin-server -> ../init.d/gremlin-server\n   /etc/rc3.d/S20gremlin-server -> ../init.d/gremlin-server\n   /etc/rc4.d/S20gremlin-server -> ../init.d/gremlin-server\n   /etc/rc5.d/S20gremlin-server -> ../init.d/gremlin-server\n```\n\nThen I rebooted my system and Gremlin Server started right away.

That should save you about 1 hour.  I don't know what OS you're on, but in Linux you can get some speed improvement if your fs is mounted with noatime (and lazytime on newer kernels). For the ultimate speed improvement, you can make your changes on the regular fs then copy up to an in-memory fs (e.g. tmpfs) and then build there.
