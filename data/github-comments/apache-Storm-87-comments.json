\nFar more better! Really amazing job, I appreciate it.\n\nBtw, I have some points to ask / report.\n- I excluded storm-kafka tests from Travis CI build (STORM-864), and github diff shows that you revived storm-kafka. \n  I'd like to exclude it again, since tests in storm-kafka fails often, and it leads untrust of Travis CI result. (Travis CI notifies us your PR is broken but it's all about test failures of storm-kafka) Or do you have some ideas to fix?\n- drpc test report seems broken.
