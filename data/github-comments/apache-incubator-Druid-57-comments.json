think we should add another option to dimension too, which is whether is dimension is multi value and what the delimiter is. Currently, we configured a global \"listDelimeter\" for overall dimension and it will cause some dimension which i think should be single-value but turns out that dimension contains some \"listDelimeter\" and druid treat it as multi-value dimension. And in second case, it sometimes hard to let users to set one listDelimeter for all multi-value dimensions because these dimensions may come from different source and owned by different people.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/173049236/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/173049264","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/2296#issuecomment-173049264","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2296","id":173049264,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MzA0OTI2NA==","user":{"login":"fjy","id":428325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODMyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy","html_url":"https://github.com/fjy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-20T01:23:02Z","updated_at":"2016-01-20T01:23:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@loganlinn Thanks for this fix.
