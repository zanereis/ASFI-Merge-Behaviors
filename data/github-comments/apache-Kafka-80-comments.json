The `ConnectSchema` also sets it's key and value schemas  as final in the constructor, so patching them up afterwards when it's an array or map would need us to be flexible on that `final` as well. But the blocking issue was that once the schema is built,  doing `.equals` or `.hashcode` causes a loop. The `FutureSchema` knows to break the hashing/equals loop. I have since thought of some scenarios where the current logic will not work as desired (for example starting a comparison with the `FutureSchema` as root), but have fix in progress (WIP until then).\n\nIn regards to the access of `FutureSchema`, I think you are correct that it shouldn't be visible outside the `SchemaBuilder`.  I now understand that the optional and default fields are related to the 'instance' of a type rather than the definition of the type. Which category are `parameters` in?\n\nI think extending the `SchemaBuilder` with a `private FutureSchemaBuilder` that only allows setting `optional` and `default` (maybe `parameters`?) clean up the API.

Yes, the plan is to come up with a better longer term fix in the future.

According to @ijuma the new `AdminClient` will only depend on our protocol, so it should be in `kafka-clients` under `org.apache.kafka.*` (the actual package name is up for discussion, there are a few options).\n\nIn that case, maybe we should, in the very-near future, move this client from kafka-tools to kafka-streams as well in `trunk` once we remove the ZK dependency, while let it stay in `0.10.0` branch, and state in the upgrade docs that this class is moved.
