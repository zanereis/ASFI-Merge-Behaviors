If you do not know what caused this error, you can try set environment variable MXNET_ENGINE_TYPEto NaiveEngine and run with debugger (i.e. gdb). This will force all operations to be synchronous and backtrace will give you the series of calls that lead to this error. Remember to set MXNET_ENGINE_TYPE back to empty after debugging.\nAborted\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/173361878/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/173431765","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/1322#issuecomment-173431765","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1322","id":173431765,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MzQzMTc2NQ==","user":{"login":"to-shimo","id":16457049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDU3MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16457049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/to-shimo","html_url":"https://github.com/to-shimo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/to-shimo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/to-shimo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/to-shimo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/to-shimo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/to-shimo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/to-shimo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/to-shimo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/to-shimo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/to-shimo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-21T02:26:41Z","updated_at":"2016-01-21T02:26:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@jermainewang not yet\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/173431765/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/173435947","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/1322#issuecomment-173435947","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1322","id":173435947,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MzQzNTk0Nw==","user":{"login":"antinucleon","id":1258974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTg5NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1258974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/antinucleon","html_url":"https://github.com/antinucleon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antinucleon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antinucleon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antinucleon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antinucleon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antinucleon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antinucleon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antinucleon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antinucleon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antinucleon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-21T02:57:42Z","updated_at":"2016-01-21T02:57:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"You may try to change rmsprop to sgd.

We agree that variable-length sequence modeling is an important part of deep learning libraries and we are currently starting to implement that in MXNet. \n\nThe idea you mentioned is very nice.

We are trying to come up with an API that makes automatic unrolling as easy as possible. Then supporting for this kind of behavior should follows easily.\n\nBut I don't understand your comments about \"end of sequence token\" and you concern that it \n\n> would be very difficult/impossible to implement sequence-to-sequence+attention with the “end of sequence token” method\n\nCan you elaborate or provide some pointers?

The primary papers that describe the \"sequence-to-sequence+attention\" papers are here:\n[Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.0473v6.pdf)\n\n[Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5346-sequence-to-sequence-learning-with-neural-networks.pdf)\n\nYou can see that they were originally developed for machine translation, but they have since been used for many other tasks (image/video captioning, conversational agents, semantic parsing, etc.)\n\nSo for the machine translation case, you have a source sentence (e.g., \"el hombre es alto\") and a target sentence (e.g., \"the man is tall\").\n\nThe state of the art model is to do the following:\n\nRun a bidrectional RNN over the source:\n\n```\nSF0 → SF1 → SF2 ... SF19\nSB0 ← SB1 ← SB2 ... SB19\n```\n\nWhere `SF` refers to the forward source recurrent layer, and `SB` is the backwards source recurrent layer (these will generally be LSTMs or GRUs).\n\nThen you take the final `SF` state and final `SB` state, concatenate them, project them through a fully connected layer, and use that as the initial recurrent state in your target network:\n\n```\nSF19 + SB0 → T'\n```\n\nNext, for each source word, you append these layers and feed them through another fully connected layer:\n\n```\nSF0 + SB0 → S0\nSF1 + SB1 → S1\n...\n```\n\nFinally you run a target recurrent network, which also computes attention over the source representation `S0, S1, ...` (basically a softmax that is performed at every step).\n\nNow imagine you were trying to do this to support variable length sequences using an \"end of sequence token\". So you unroll your network to a max of 50 source words and 50 target words. But for the current batch, you want to limit it to 20 source words and 20 target words. You would have a bunch of problems:\n- The bidirectional source network would be difficult, because the _first_ forward node actually corresponds to the _last_ backward node (in the order of the dag). So you can't just run the first 20 from `SF` and the first 20 from `SB`, because the first 20 from `SB` actually corresponds to words 30-49, not 0-19.\n- The part where you take the final `SF` and final `SB` is also a problem with early termination. It would be expecting to to be connected to `SF49` and `SB0`. But we actually need it to be connected to `SF19` and `SB0`.\n- On the target side, you only want to attend to `S0` through `S19`. But it will actually try to attend to `S0` through `S49`. Making it only attend to `S0` through `S19` would require a lot of special logic. \n\nTensorFlow supports such a model with variable length sequences out of the box without any special logic, using the method that I had described.\n\nI'm pretty sure that MxNet can support such a network also,  just not with variable length sequences  (Although I haven't figured out whether the attention layer can be implemented in just the python layer or requires its own C++ operator, but that's a separate question).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/173666508/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/173732066","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/1325#issuecomment-173732066","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1325","id":173732066,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MzczMjA2Ng==","user":{"login":"wwkong","id":1240650,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDA2NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1240650?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wwkong","html_url":"https://github.com/wwkong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wwkong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wwkong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wwkong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wwkong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wwkong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wwkong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wwkong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wwkong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wwkong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-21T22:18:57Z","updated_at":"2016-01-21T22:18:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks!
