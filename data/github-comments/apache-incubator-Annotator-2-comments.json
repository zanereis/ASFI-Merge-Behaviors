Even if non-normalized empty / adjacent text nodes is a \"weird\" edge-case to start with, the assertion that the DOM will be restored to its exact original form is not 100% bullet proof, which can be problematic in usage scenarios where the DOM must be a source of truth for further selections / annotations. A pragmatic workaround for this is to reload the document from scratch instead of walking the tree in order to revert each individual DOM mutation, but this may not be a practical solution in usage scenarios where some context must persist.\r\n\r\nAs always, there are pros/cons, and interspersing DOM elements in order to \"mark\" text ranges no doubt has its merits. However, there are evident computational costs in \"wrapping\" + \"unwrapping\" DOM mutations, possibly also triggering prohibitive web browser's render/layout. In my experience though, performance degradation only becomes perceivable in stress-tested cases, for example when highlighting many thousands of search results inside a large document. I realize that the vast majority of use-cases probably do not require such level of scrutiny.\r\n\r\nJust a bit of background to explain why I am paying attention to Apache Annotator, Hypothesis, etc.:\r\n\r\nI work on a Readium project where document \"annotations\" are rendered using pixel-perfect overlays (i.e. shape \"drawings\" made with SVG or HTML elements + CSS), which are displayed above text characters using CSS mix blend mode 'multiply' in order to preserve text contrast, and with a translucent background color to \"paint\" the actual highlighting shape.\r\n\r\nDOM mutations are batched and inserted at the end of the original document (using DocumentFragments), which is a more efficient technique than tree-walking and interspersing individual mutations. The primary computational cost is therefore the calculation of \"client rectangles\" (i.e. 2D shape coordinates at the character level), but this is relatively cheap if no re-renders are triggered in the web browser engine. The arithmetics needed to optimize the bounding shapes are cheap too (i.e. elimination of duplicates, overlapping regions, thin areas, etc.)\r\n\r\nBundling DOM \"annotations\" together at the end of the original DOM makes it easy to blacklist \"foreign\" document artefacts when calculating / matching references to the unadulterated HTML (simply speaking, we can just ignore whole subtrees when computing CSS selectors or when resolving DOM Ranges, for example). \r\n\r\nWe use pointer-events 'none' so that annotation overlays are effectively \"transparent\" to user interactions with the underlying document, which in turn makes it possible to create overlapping text selections / highlights. That being said, annotation overlays remain \"tactile\" in the sense that we simulate direct interaction using event delegation, for example to implement hit-testing with the mouse cursor, for hover and click actions at the level of each individual highlight.\r\n\r\nAs a final note, I will say that out-of-band overlays (versus inline / interspersed DOM mutations)  introduced non-trivial implementation challenges related to the different display modes our application supports. This is in the EPUB context, so we have the traditional vertical \"webby\" scrolling view, a paginated mode (using CSS Columns), and fixed-layout (i.e. document root scaled with a zoom factor to fit entirely into the visible viewport). Once the idiosyncrasies of the CSS box model with `position` `absolute` vs. `fixed` in these different rendering contexts were figured-out ... we were good to go :)\r\n\r\nSorry to bombard you with slightly-unrelated information, I hope this is a useful exchange nonetheless. Keep up the good work in Apache Annotator and related projects (CC @tilgovi too).\r\n\r\nPS: our project will at some point visit the problem space of creating interoperable annotations, likely relying on the W3C standard(s)...so I will continue to watch your projects.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-annotator/issues/comments/635428423/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-annotator/issues/comments/635894043","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-annotator/issues/80#issuecomment-635894043","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-annotator/issues/80","id":635894043,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzNTg5NDA0Mw==","user":{"login":"Treora","id":4191409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxOTE0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4191409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Treora","html_url":"https://github.com/Treora","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Treora/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Treora/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Treora/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Treora/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Treora/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Treora/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Treora/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Treora/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Treora/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-29T10:15:23Z","updated_at":"2020-05-29T10:15:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the elaboration, this sounds like great work.

I just created some simple tests (see PR #84), including ones inspired by the examples above, that deal with situations like this: `'<b>lorem ipsum <mark>dolor <mark2>am</mark2></mark><mark2>et yada</mark2> yada</b>'`.\r\n\r\nNote there is a difficulty with how a Range behaves when the DOM is modified: running highlight with our current highlighter can mess up other Range objects that point at the same text nodes. So this can cause trouble:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrange1 = anchor(annotation1);\r\nrange2 = anchor(annotation2);\r\nhighlight(range1); // this may mess up range2\r\nhighlight(range2); // highlights some unintended target.\r\n```\r\n\r\nA solution is to anchor&highlight as a single action: considering the Range a ephemeral pointer:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrange1 = anchor(annotation1);\r\nhighlight(range1);\r\nrange2 = anchor(annotation2);\r\nhighlight(range2);\r\n```\r\n\r\nOur generator-based approach to anchoring should help to do this right, but still it is a pitfall that I’m not very happy with. Some ideas for avoiding this problem:\r\n- Using a highlighter that does not modify the document content; some highlighter approaches add an (svg) element to the end of the `<body>` and display it on the right spot using absolute positioning. While solving this issue, it does create others (e.g. need to reposition the element when text reflows).\r\n- Stop using Range for our ‘hydrated’ selector, i.e. as our way to point at a part of the DOM. We could e.g. try implement a ‘RobustRange’ that updates its start-&endContainer&-Offset as needed in one way or another.\r\n\r\nFor the time being, or if we decide not to fix this, we should probably warn users in any documentation and examples that Ranges are perishable.\r\n\r\nNote that the behaviour of Range actually differs between the current jsdom and web browsers, so it is important to run relevant tests in a browser (use our `yarn start` command) to ensure the tests pass there too.\r\n\r\nOn the bright side, I added [tests](https://github.com/apache/incubator-annotator/blob/d4d933c61bb559221b5dd896fde399fc53adedba/packages/dom/test/highlight-range/highlight-range.test.ts#L172-L198) to check if one can remove highlights in arbitrary order, and that seems to work as intended. This should give the freedom to ignore the tree structure and treat highlights as being independent from each other. Please suggest/write other scenarios that we should include in our tests.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-annotator/issues/comments/663510334/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-annotator/issues/comments/674584671","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-annotator/issues/81#issuecomment-674584671","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-annotator/issues/81","id":674584671,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3NDU4NDY3MQ==","user":{"login":"tilgovi","id":20818,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilgovi","html_url":"https://github.com/tilgovi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilgovi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilgovi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilgovi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilgovi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilgovi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilgovi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilgovi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilgovi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilgovi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-16T22:15:36Z","updated_at":"2020-08-16T22:15:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I

The text MUST be normalized before recording the annotation. Thus HTML/XML tags SHOULD be removed and character entities SHOULD be replaced with the character that they encode.\r\n\r\nAs long as we stick to `textContent` or `innerText`, we are covered here. The tags are not part of this and entities are already replaced.\r\n\r\n> Possibly more problematic, can one even access the source html accurately enough through the DOM? Might a source parser have modified whitespace, thus leading to miscounts? I am not even talking about executed scripts that may modify the DOM too, I suppose we have to disregard that scenario.\r\n\r\nWe should be fine, at least for text nodes. The CSS white space properties make it important that parsers preserve the text nodes as is.\r\n\r\nI think the spec is still somewhat vague and open to interpretation. I am partial to using `innerText` because it's the closest to the actual presentation. Regardless of what we choose, we have some work that supports any decision and helps us handle characters with multiple code units.\r\n\r\nIterating over a string in JavaScript yields strings representing the code points (each iteration may yield a string with more than one code units). As a result, one can also do `[...string]` and get an array of the code points. If we write a generic text position selector in terms of iteration over code points then we can compose it with anything that generates such an iterator from any other source, like generating `innerText` from a DOM Node or Range. The simplest thing is to call it with `[...string]`.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think we should consider going a step further and writing a text selector that consumes an iterator that yields _chunks_ rather than receiving a full text with the initial call. This interface would be useful for streaming scenarios where the whole text may not be available or may be extremely large. The chunks themselves could be arrays or strings, and if we decide that they are strings we may wish to iterate over their code points.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-annotator/issues/comments/674586963/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-annotator/issues/comments/674593638","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-annotator/issues/51#issuecomment-674593638","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-annotator/issues/51","id":674593638,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3NDU5MzYzOA==","user":{"login":"tilgovi","id":20818,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilgovi","html_url":"https://github.com/tilgovi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilgovi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilgovi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilgovi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilgovi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilgovi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilgovi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilgovi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilgovi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilgovi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-16T23:41:54Z","updated_at":"2020-08-16T23:41:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'll close this for now, as it seems like we may not need this at the moment.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-annotator/issues/comments/674593638/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-annotator/issues/comments/674803745","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-annotator/issues/80#issuecomment-674803745","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-annotator/issues/80","id":674803745,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3NDgwMzc0NQ==","user":{"login":"Treora","id":4191409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxOTE0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4191409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Treora","html_url":"https://github.com/Treora","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Treora/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Treora/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Treora/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Treora/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Treora/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Treora/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Treora/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Treora/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Treora/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-17T10:36:45Z","updated_at":"2020-08-17T10:36:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Is there any action here, or are we okay to leave the nodes split?\r\n\r\nI ended up thinking that running e.g. `range.commonAncestorContainer.normalize()` in the cleanup would be a bit much; I’d rather not merge nodes we did not touch.

Since Selector has only an optional `refinedBy` attribute, any selector should be fine, so long as it does not redefine `refinedBy` to be anything else. I do want to capture the notion of iterative refinement, but maybe parametrization of the Selector interface would allow us to define `makeRefinable` such that the output match function creator accepts and produces a sub-type of Selector that conforms to the original input type of the provided `createMatcher` function.\r\n\r\n> Hurting developer experience sounds undesirable; but this change makes the code and API simpler, which may actually help developers.

There's a canonical short-hand of attribute names provided by the JSON-LD context, but I was thinking that it's not necessary to require that the selectors have a `type` field with any particular value.

See my [issue #37](https://github.com/WICG/scroll-to-text-fragment/issues/137) on the spec’s repo.\r\n\r\nTo use the fragment syntax as a standard for use within, and exchange between, annotation softwares, one could of course choose to interpret it differently (except when activating a ‘browser compat mode’), e.g. as a WA RangeSelector containing two TextQuoteSelectors. But that might lead to a misleading situation of half-interoperability which seems better to avoid.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, for the goal of making annotations (ex)portable from annotation tools, it could be valuable to have a tool that helps convert (where possible) annotation targets to browser-compatible text-fragment URLs.

For the concrete implementation, I actually used `Range`s as the `TChunk` type, with each `Range` wrapping a single text node. (we can’t just throw in text nodes themselves, both because their `toString()` method does not return the text content, and because the first and the last node might be only partially part of the scope).\r\n\r\nFor the text quote matching this works fine (all tests pass). For describing a text quote however, it would be helpful to have more freedom to navigate the text, instead of only walking through it in a single pass (especially to find prefixes). I suppose our scope should have an API that is more like a TreeWalker than like a NodeIterator: jump to any spot, and then walk in either direction.\r\n\r\n@tilgovi: Any thoughts about the approach to try, before I go further down this rabbit hole?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-annotator/issues/comments/693569313/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-annotator/issues/comments/694930052","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-annotator/issues/90#issuecomment-694930052","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-annotator/issues/90","id":694930052,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5NDkzMDA1Mg==","user":{"login":"Treora","id":4191409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxOTE0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4191409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Treora","html_url":"https://github.com/Treora","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Treora/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Treora/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Treora/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Treora/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Treora/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Treora/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Treora/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Treora/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Treora/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-18T15:20:08Z","updated_at":"2020-09-18T16:11:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"What exactly would a meta-package provide?

Or we can just publish the latest tarball on the website: e.g. `npm install https://annotator.apache.org/packages/dom/0.2.0-dev.tar.gz` would be nice?

We agreed that just parsing the syntax is not much use, as it comes together with a specific algorithm for finding the target text, which differs from the Web Annotation model.\r\n\r\nA quick overview of things we could provide:\r\n\r\n- anchoring of a fragment directive: I implemented the essence of this already (see above comment); we could provide a function that simply wraps my implementation. (we even discussed the option of importing my whole implementation into this repo, though to me it feels cleaner to keep these as separate projects)\r\n\r\n- describing a selection (a Range or perhaps a list of Ranges) as a fragment directive: this would need a custom adaptation of `describeTextQuote`, modified to ensure that the total quote (including prefix&suffix) ends at word boundaries (note that at least this is possible now, since a recent [change][] in the spec). Also, it should use a `textStart,textEnd` pair (again to be cut at word boundaries) instead of an exact quote when the selection crosses block elements. And perhaps there are more hurdles.\r\n\r\n- convert fragment directive ⇒ Selector: If the document is available, we could simply anchor it and describe it in the other format. Without the document at hand, we could also convert it, although with a (hopefully small) risk that the differences in specifications will make it fail to anchor or (worse) point at something else. I think the conversion could, after syntax parsing, be done with more or less this simple code:\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n    ({ prefix, textStart, textEnd, suffix }) => textEnd\r\n        ? {\r\n            type: 'RangeSelector',\r\n            start: { type: 'TextQuoteSelector', prefix, exact: textStart },\r\n            end: { type: 'TextQuoteSelector', prefix: textEnd, exact: '', suffix }\r\n        }\r\n        : { type: 'TextQuoteSelector', prefix, exact: textStart, suffix }\r\n    ```\r\n    (note the little hack of using `prefix: textEnd, exact: ''` because RangeSelector’s end is exclusive and `textEnd` should nevertheless be included in the target)\r\n\r\n- convert Selector ⇒ fragment directive: the reverse of the above. Again, if the document is available, we could simply anchor it and describe it in the other format. But in case the document is not available, conversion in this direction would only possible if the selector is of the type/shape shown in the above example code.\r\n\r\nI suppose it is mainly a matter of demand and priority whether we’ll implement any of these. I might actually try tackle some of these points soon, as I would like to use these features myself.\r\n\r\n[change]: https://github.com/WICG/scroll-to-text-fragment/pull/148","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-annotator/issues/comments/722659798/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-annotator/issues/comments/722666886","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-annotator/issues/92#issuecomment-722666886","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-annotator/issues/92","id":722666886,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyMjY2Njg4Ng==","user":{"login":"Treora","id":4191409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxOTE0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4191409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Treora","html_url":"https://github.com/Treora","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Treora/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Treora/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Treora/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Treora/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Treora/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Treora/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Treora/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Treora/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Treora/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-05T21:52:02Z","updated_at":"2020-11-05T21:52:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Note from today’s call: supposedly yarn 2 should be able to install packages from within a monorepo, so we could start with accepting that nightly users have to use yarn 2, and hopefully npm and other clients follow.

This makes sense, though I wonder if it might cause e.g. a one-character prefix to have an unfairly heavy influence on the match score (perhaps not significant, but dropping this thought here for later).\r\n\r\nCC @robertknight (happy to hear if you have more research notes, experimental results or other relevant tips from your experience developing this!)\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/hypothesis/client/blob/0c2871ab98e6cf0a2bbfdb4d0aba439a3ba9039a/src/annotator/anchoring/match-quote.js#L109-L145\r\n[2]: https://github.com/hypothesis/client/blob/0c2871ab98e6cf0a2bbfdb4d0aba439a3ba9039a/src/annotator/anchoring/match-quote.js#L55-L64","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-annotator/issues/comments/750943153/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
