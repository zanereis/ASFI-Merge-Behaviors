will test for regressions during weekend. One thing I did note is that the new dataframe mutation logic has similarities with the existing label mutation logic. The original one serves two purposes:\r\n1. Making label names compatible with the db engine. Example: making sure that BigQuery labels don't start with a number, making sure the label name doesn't exceed the max length etc.\r\n2. Making sure that the dataframe label name is exactly the same as is expected. Example: Redshift changes `SUM(x)` to `sum(x)`.\r\n\r\nThe new method essentially takes care of the latter case, making that task redundant from the original label mutator. Going forward having this overlap will be very confusing for developers, and would be good to refactor, essentially deferring case 2 mutation the the dataframe mutator only. Once the dust settles I can put in a PR to clarify that.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/461710880/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/461710957","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/6836#issuecomment-461710957","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/6836","id":461710957,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MTcxMDk1Nw==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-08T07:06:07Z","updated_at":"2019-02-08T07:06:07Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Looks like this is confusing indeed, the comment comes from https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/4451 where the auto generated `gunicorn` command (started through `superset runserver`) started getting deprecation messages but appears to still work.\r\n\r\nThe config element `SUPERSET_WEBSERVER_TIMEOUT` is still used widely across the codebase. \r\n\r\nTimeouts are much more complicated than a sane person would expect. Let me document some things here:\r\n* first your proxy / load balancer / envoy / kong thing may time out before your web server does. When that happen I think nothing is returned and the request is just forever lost. The webserver may still do work, and has no way to return a response.\r\n* flask offers no way to set a timeout, but your wsgi server does (gunicorn / nginx / ...) when that happens, it does return a proper response with an error code. Without us generating the `gunicorn` command (per #4451), people have to keep the timeouts in sync manually\r\n* we have code on the client side that gives up if it looks like it'll never get a timeout response, I'm not sure if it's implement consistently across all \"requests that may time out\"\r\n\r\nRegardless, I think we should remove the \" # deprecated\" comment and add some notes in there.

Some quick feedback:\r\n\r\nIt looks like `data source` and `dropdown` are seperate buttons but they've been pushed together.\r\n\r\nThe [react bootstrap example](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.com/components/dropdowns/#split-button-dropdowns) we looked at uses the component `SplitButton`.\r\n\r\n- Could we use that component tweaked to fit that space or do we need to find a creative solution on how to handle this with the existing component?\r\n- One option would be to remove the rounded corners only on one side of the `data source` and `dropdown`? Might be pretty tricky/hacky though.\r\n- Could you push them closer together maybe?\r\n\r\nOne visual affordance that would help us here is the hover state like in the react bootstrap split button example. The two elements being side by side are distinguished by their hover states. I strongly suggest we implement some form of indication you're hovering over one side or the other of the split button.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/461985517/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/461988698","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/6804#issuecomment-461988698","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/6804","id":461988698,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MTk4ODY5OA==","user":{"login":"timifasubaa","id":30888507,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwODg4NTA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30888507?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timifasubaa","html_url":"https://github.com/timifasubaa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timifasubaa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timifasubaa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timifasubaa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timifasubaa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timifasubaa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timifasubaa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timifasubaa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timifasubaa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timifasubaa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-09T00:06:57Z","updated_at":"2019-02-09T00:07:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@john-bodley
