My current version would mean Groovy will in that case fail to resolve the class and eventually fail resolving completely. I guess you are right.

Are they not useful for other purposes?\r\n\r\nThere are two cases, both of them are unused. \r\nFirst there is the ParameterTypes constructor, which loads types based on String. This is something we have to be extra careful with, because  this works only if the correct class loader is used. Which means there is only a limited use for this method in specific cases and in general we cannot use it. IMHO it makes no sense to keep this around. \r\nNext is the MetaMethod:\r\n   ```\r\n      public void checkParameters(Class[] arguments) {\r\n        // let's check that the argument types are valid\r\n        if (!isValidMethod(arguments)) {\r\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\r\n                    \"Parameters to method: \"\r\n                    + getName()\r\n                    + \" do not match types: \"\r\n                    + FormatHelper.toString(getParameterTypes())\r\n                    + \" for arguments: \"\r\n                    + FormatHelper.toString(arguments));\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nfor our runtime this method has no  use. We have isValidMethod instead, which is also used in this case. The method is just a wrapper around that for error reporting. This could be useful in theory, but I don't see why we should keep it. I mean what is the scenario for it?\r\n \r\n> Besides replacing with standard types, does this improve performance or memory usage or some other characteristic?\r\n\r\nIt should be a bit more threadsafe since I use the concurrent hashmap. But I think in department we will have to do quite a bit more work. Otherwise the goal was no improving performance or memory usage but maintainability.

dead code analysis, as its name shown, it just traverses AST and does not change the AST, so no tranforming [sic] changes involved.\r\n\r\nThis was understood.  The point is that if you add a compiler error you may fail code that previously compiled.  A compiler warning allows the user to be notified but continue using code unchanged.  Also, you scan the AST at a specific point in time.  If later AST transformations occur that address the dead code scenarios, you have false positive.\r\n\r\nI'm just trying to have you describe your reasoning for when to do the analysis.  Even the class generator does a bit of instruction re-ordering that may or may not introduce dead code paths.  It seems the goal of this change is to identify any dead statements explicitly represented in the source file.  If that is indeed the case, it would be good to state all of this in the original problem description.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/1881861904/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/1883409009","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/2019#issuecomment-1883409009","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/2019","id":1883409009,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAgdnis5wQopx","user":{"login":"daniellansun","id":9151616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxNTE2MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9151616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun","html_url":"https://github.com/daniellansun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-09T16:46:40Z","updated_at":"2024-01-09T16:46:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merged.

So I would like to accept your suggestion putting `isNonSealed()` into `ClassNodeUtils`.\r\n\r\nBTW, `Class` has `isSealed()` method, so it would be better to align with its API

per comment in the issue, I'll close this PR. There is plenty of scope for further improvements - as noted, even with POJO, records still make calls into runtime. This is why @POJO is marked @Incubating and one of the things we still plan to improve. But it is the kind of thing we'd like to improve for more than just records if we can, so we'd target a broader change if we can make such a change.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/1926785163/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/1926786023","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/2048#issuecomment-1926786023","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/2048","id":1926786023,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAgdnis5y2Gvn","user":{"login":"paulk-asert","id":280016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MDAxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/280016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert","html_url":"https://github.com/paulk-asert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-05T11:39:10Z","updated_at":"2024-02-05T11:39:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Plan

That didn't happen here (yet), but feel free to create a new PR with some of @daniellansun's points addressed if you wish, or start a thread on the mailing list to avoid further disappointment.\r\n\r\nFor me personally, I'd like to explore performing a change like what you suggested when the declaring class is marked with POJO, but I'd like to see it handle more than just the empty case. In that case, we explicitly want to avoid calling back through ScriptBytecodeAdapter, so the direction you are heading makes sense. I personally don't mind if empty map, etc. aren't covered up front since we often make such changes iteratively, and we could handle that next.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/1953451647/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/1956687500","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/2020#issuecomment-1956687500","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/2020","id":1956687500,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAgdnis50oK6M","user":{"login":"daniellansun","id":9151616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxNTE2MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9151616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun","html_url":"https://github.com/daniellansun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-21T13:46:02Z","updated_at":"2024-02-21T13:46:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merged.
