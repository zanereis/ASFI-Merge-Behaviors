It reminds me why this change is necessary.\n\nWe have been leaving expression compiler which has lots of unimplemented things and also bugs. It was pushed more than 6 months before and only few of contributors are taking care of. We have lots of milestones (not a single task) to do even without Storm SQL, like Unified API, extending Window feature (session, etc.), Beam integration, Java porting, Metrics, and so on. Even I have been focusing to work on Storm SQL, I give up keeping expression compiler because of having less eyes to watch, and error-prone way of building code block (string concatenation). We could save amount of time if we replaced this faster, and it will save another amount of time.\n\nBtw, normally we're often worry about dependency if dependency's activity is low or release interval is too long. But Calcite's release interval for minor release is even faster than Storm's bugfix release.\nCalcite released 1.7.0 from Mar 22, 1.8.0 from Jun 13, and 1.9.0 from Sep 22, and 1.10.0 today. I have already fixed two bugs in unit tests and will be shipped to 1.10.1 or 1.11.0.\n(Yes in this case we need to wait on that.)\n\nI'm not on the fence of making it pluggable, but just wondering we have comparable plugs on that, and we can make an effort for that. Would you want to be a sponsor on current expression compiler?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/253144924/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/253160047","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1714#issuecomment-253160047","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1714","id":253160047,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MzE2MDA0Nw==","user":{"login":"arunmahadevan","id":6792890,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3OTI4OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6792890?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan","html_url":"https://github.com/arunmahadevan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-12T09:09:31Z","updated_at":"2016-10-12T09:09:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@HeartSaVioR I suggested to keep an option to plug our code generator.

Let me rearrange your questions:\n\n> Has this changed the workflow of StormSQL?\n\nNo, we still rely on Trident, and nothing changed in point of workflow.\n\n> Motive behind this big change and benefits\n\nThis is started from [Julian's comment](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-1040?focusedCommentId=15034472&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-15034472) and also [Milinda's comment](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-1040?focusedCommentId=15035182&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-15035182).\n\nFor me having own relational algebras (rel) has several advantages, \n- We can push operator handling logic to rel itself. Before that we should traverse Calcite logical rel  tree with PostOrderRelNodeVisitor, and visitor needs to handle Calcite's rel directly. Now the logic how to configure Trident topology is all handled from separate rels.\n- We sometimes want to have more derived rels compared to Calcite logical operators. One of example is `Join`.  There's only one logical rel regarding join in Calcite - LogicalJoin - but we're now converting LogicalJoin to EquiJoin if conditions are met. If we have various types of join it will make the difference. We're not prepared yet, but streaming scan vs table scan, and streaming insert vs table insert are the other cases.\n\n```\nTridentStormAggregateRel(group=[{0}], EXPR$1=[COUNT()])\n  TridentStormCalcRel(expr#0..4=[{inputs}], expr#5=[0], expr#6=[>($t0, $t5)], DEPTID=[$t3], EMPID=[$t0], $condition=[$t6])\n    TridentStormEquiJoinRel(condition=[=($2, $3)], joinType=[inner])\n      TridentStormStreamScanRel(table=[[EMP]])\n      TridentStormStreamScanRel(table=[[DEPT]])\n```\n\nWe can even override the methods how to represent the rel in explain string if we think Calcite's explain is less informational. For example, showing initial parallelism (when we support) for Scan.\n- This patch starts addressing query optimizations. One of example is Calc, which is for merging multiple calculations into one. No need to filter and projection separately. They're still not minimized (as projection is), but it can be addressed after STORM-2072. Defining derived rels helps further query optimizations, like filter pushdown. Calcite rels is not aware of data source characteristic, and we can include it to our own rels.\n\nPlease don't hesitate to ask questions. Thanks!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/254130059/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/254222316","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1736#issuecomment-254222316","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1736","id":254222316,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NDIyMjMxNg==","user":{"login":"manuzhang","id":1191767,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTE3Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1191767?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang","html_url":"https://github.com/manuzhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-17T14:24:46Z","updated_at":"2016-10-17T14:24:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@HeartSaVioR Thanks for the thorough explanation.

Both built in and user metrics use these. </p>\n\n<p>Then they have their own implementation of a registry, but it doesn't seem to be related to the codahale MetricRegistry. They send metrics via netty or thrift by querying their registry. If from worker, they send via netty to topology master. If from topology master, they send to Nimbus via thrift. </p>\n\n<p>From thrift it goes to the rocksdb cache (there's an interface around this).

Do we think we need to have some step between workers and centralized collection s.t. reporters can live at a higher level (one reporter per cluster for example)?
