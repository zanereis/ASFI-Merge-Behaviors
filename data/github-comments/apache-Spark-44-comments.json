First of all, the complexity should be `O(nnz)` instead of `O(n d)`. This is a little bit tricky. Basically, we don't need to update zeros for a sparse vector. Suppose we have the following column:\n\n```\n1.0\n0.0\n2.0\n0.0\n3.0\n0.0\n0.0\n```\n\nTo apply the formula for mean/variance, you need to do the update at the second row. This is actually not necessary because the summary statistics are invariant to the ordering. Imagine we have this column re-arranged:\n\n```\n1.0\n2.0\n3.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n```\n\nwhich still have the same summary statistics. We can skip all zeros and do mean/variance updates based on the non-zero count instead of global count. After `aggregate`, we know we need to accumulate 4 zeros to the column, which is a constant-time operation.\n\nI'm okay if you don't have enough time to make the change in this PR. Put a TODO and we can fix it later.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39034276/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39034504","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/252#issuecomment-39034504","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/252","id":39034504,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MDM0NTA0","user":{"login":"mengxr","id":829644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyOTY0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/829644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr","html_url":"https://github.com/mengxr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-03-30T18:28:01Z","updated_at":"2014-03-30T18:28:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rxin , it looks good to me.

It is called `org.apache.mahout.text.SequenceFilesFromDirectory`. However, it is hard to use, and I think it is not suitable to call it from Spark directly because it will import some heavy packages.\n- For HDFS, it is not a good practice to hold so many small files, it will occupy lots of NameNode entries, with many blanks in blocks of DataNode. So I do not know whether it is generally used in other programs. But it is useful in machine learning algorithms such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Indeed, it is the pre - pull request for my LDA implementation.\n- A 100MB single file will usually be hold in two blocks with 2 replicas each. The `CombineFileInputFormat` class in mapred, i.e. the `HadoopFile` API in `SparkContext` cannot handle the split problem, because it allocates blocks to splits without the single file semantic. But the `CombineFileInputFormat` class in mapreduce do that, if we set the `isSplit()` function to false, it will put a single file into the same split, no matter whether the file exceeds a block size or not.\n- I have tested the split problem in the former [test suite](https://github.com/yinxusen/spark/commit/78c0f259a848aadc168edd76f9992ed4404bc510#diff-3f8bae96199c64e746098bd7a6d143e1R72) `fs.create(new Path(inputDir, fileName), true, 4096, 2, 512, null)`. Here I set the block size to 512, and I use three different file sizes to test it.\n\n@mengxr Sorry I forget to test the split problem when using local disk as input source. I will add it ASAP. I think it will also have the chance to adjust block size when reading from local disk, or I have to write a file whose size exceeds 32MB (default local disk block size in Hadoop).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39047305/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39047518","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/274#issuecomment-39047518","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/274","id":39047518,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MDQ3NTE4","user":{"login":"AmplabJenkins","id":4031291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzEyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4031291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/AmplabJenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-03-31T01:39:03Z","updated_at":"2014-03-31T01:39:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Merged build finished.
