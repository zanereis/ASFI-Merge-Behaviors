Search before asking\n\n- [X] I had searched in the [issues](https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues?q=is%3Aissue) and found no similar feature requirement.\n\n\n### Description\n\nChinese description:\r\n[Function] [API] Customize built-in parameters\r\nWorkflows in all projects can get custom built-in parameters.\n\n### Use case\n\nAt present, the built-in parameters provided in the latest version 2.0.5 are based on T-1 and other related time parameters, but the financial industry (securities) is relatively special. The time for the scheduled batch running task is not T-1 (the batch running time parameter is not fixed), but trading day. Since the time parameters of each workflow are the same (the previous trading day), parameters between workflows cannot be passed, only parameters within the same workflow can be passed. Therefore, in order to obtain the same time parameter for all workflows, the first task we start in each workflow of all projects is to obtain the trading day, set it as the time parameter, and pass it on as a parameter. We hope that built-in parameters can be customized to facilitate access to all workflows.\n\n### Related issues\n\n_No response_\n\n### Are you willing to submit a PR?\n\n- [X] Yes I am willing to
