There are many ways that Kafka can loose tracking of consumer offsets but you can verify it by setting expire offset parameter to some ridiculously short period.

I'm not sure why you expect the poll to return records after seekToEnd? seekToEnd seeks to the end of the log in Kafka, and it doesn't actually do the seek until poll or position is called on the consumer. The result is that the consumer's position is at the last offset in the log, which means it won't emit anything until new messages are added to Kafka.\r\n\r\nDue to this issue it will probably cause the spout to stop emitting entirely, since the failed offsets keep triggering the seekToEnd, which makes the spout skip past all new messages every time it polls.\r\n\r\nI verified this behavior with a small example application with a single consumer that just calls seekToEnd and poll in a loop.

I have made a small change that eliminates the main source of slowness, but it's still not great.\r\n\r\nThe current version of the code runs in about 150% of the time the original code does, so certainly not good. Most of the increase in runtime comes from the more general task selection algorithm. I have been able to speed things up a little bit more, but I suspect the benefits are not really worth it. Perhaps that means this code simply doesn't need to be merged in, or it could be added as a separate grouping, but here are a few observations I made along the way:\r\n\r\n* I did not notice the slowdown in our deployment of this code because we know our key set is only a few thousand elements, allowing us to wrap the AssignmentCreator in a caching decorator. This trades a larger memory footprint for better performance. With the caching AssignmentCreator decorator, this grouping runs in 80% of the time the original takes. This is sort of the point of the refactor; customizations like this become possible with just a few lines of code.\r\n* By far, the slowest part of this grouping is the hashing functions in createAssignment.

One of the fixes made in this PR is to make doSeekRetriablePartitions seek to the last committed offset instead of the end of the partition when findNextCommitOffset returns null.\r\n\r\nHere's the null case code from 1.0.4 https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/v1.0.4/external/storm-kafka-client/src/main/java/org/apache/storm/kafka/spout/KafkaSpout.java#L283. Note that the comment in that line is wrong, and it's actually seeking to the end of the partition.\r\n\r\nHere's the code for the same case after this PR https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1679/files#diff-7d7cbc8f5444fa7ada7962033fc31c5eR269. Note that it now matches the comment.\r\n\r\nYour understanding of OffsetResetStrategy.LATEST is also slightly off. The OffsetResetStrategy describes the behavior of the KafkaConsumer when the consumer requests an offset that is out of range. Offsets are out of range if they are smaller than the beginning of the log (e.g. if parts of the partition were deleted), or if they are larger than the offset of the largest message in the partition. For example if you have a partition with offsets 10-500 present and the consumer tries to seek to offset 0, you will trigger the OffsetResetStrategy. The strategy has no effect on seekToEnd. seekToEnd always seeks to the last offset on the partition, barring some additions made in 0.11.0.0 that have to do with transactional writes.\r\n\r\nI think what happened in your case is what I described above, you hit one of the bugs solved by this PR, and as a result your consumer jumped to the end of the partition, which caused it to emit no messages.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/338717702/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/338717821","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2381#issuecomment-338717821","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2381","id":338717821,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzODcxNzgyMQ==","user":{"login":"srdo","id":4324588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjQ1ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4324588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo","html_url":"https://github.com/srdo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-23T16:31:59Z","updated_at":"2017-10-23T16:31:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/338717821/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2613033669","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/6488#issuecomment-2613033669","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/6488","id":2613033669,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTMwMzM2Njk=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-23T18:32:37Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T17:21:33Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=srdo\">srdo</a>:</i>\n<p><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=kabhwan\" class=\"user-hover\" rel=\"kabhwan\">Jungtaek Lim</a> Sorry, I missed your comment here.

But I was looking into it.  Each tuple that is leaked is only about 120 bytes in 1.x and about 100 in 0.10 and below, in 2.x it is 40 bytes.  So in order to leak 1 MB in 1.x it would take 9,000 tuples that are truly lost, not just timed out but truly lost.  So my guess is that it is just such a small leak that most of the time it is not a big deal.
