general, this looks very good @gweidner, but I would recommend to leave the internal compiler/runtime constants and opcodes as they are (i.e., CEIL) in favor of brevity.

Just out of curiosity, I double checked R and SparkR: ceiling is the base function in R but there are R packages that define ceil as an alias too; SparkR also supports both.
