for the late reply, one of our machines crashed. We tried using another machine and tried setting up Pulsar, but we could not even start Bookie because of less RAM availability. We used two machines one with 12Gb RAM + SSD and another with 8Gb RAM + HDD, Bookie ran perfectly on the 12GB system, but in the 8Gb system, it crashed exactly after 2 minutes. Is lesser RAM causing the issue? What are the recommended specs for running Pulsar?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/554869895/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/554964021","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/5680#issuecomment-554964021","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/5680","id":554964021,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NDk2NDAyMQ==","user":{"login":"codelipenghui","id":12592133,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTkyMTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12592133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui","html_url":"https://github.com/codelipenghui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-18T10:55:54Z","updated_at":"2019-11-18T10:55:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"run

@candlerb, \r\nI think this tenant and namespace should remove from the standalone.\r\n\r\nhere is a PIP for removing the cluster of a namespace: https://github.com/apache/pulsar/wiki/PIP-10:-Remove-cluster-for-namespace-and-topic-names.\r\n\r\nA topic name consists of `domain`, `tenant`, `namespace`, and `topic`. The latest version of Pulsar already removes the cluster name for a topic name. The tenant name and namespace name can not include the `/` because we use the `/` to separate it. You can use `-=:.` to create a namespace name if you need to create a name with multipart. As far as I know, there is nothing to restrict the topic name. So you can use any characters as your topic name.\r\n\r\nAnd here has an admin API doc might can help you:
