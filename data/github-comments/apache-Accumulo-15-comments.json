Having multiple indexes might simplify certain types of analysis and complicate others.  It would be nice to be able to easily filter the lowest level.  Perhaps the level could be printed on the left hand side, like this: \r\n```\r\n\tIndex Entries\r\n\t\tL0,0              : Key: r1 f1:q5 [] 1497902395419 false NumEntries: 4 Offset: 16 CompressedSize: 53 RawSize: 66\r\n\t\tL0,1              : Key: r2 f1:q5 [] 1497902395419 false NumEntries: 4 Offset: 16 CompressedSize: 53 RawSize: 66\r\n```\r\n\r\nOverall it seems worthwhile though to provide more information.  I'd welcome Keith's offer of posting a function.  Feel free to adjust the PR with the suggested code if you'd like or I can modify it.  \r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/309733448/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/309737477","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/269#issuecomment-309737477","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/269","id":309737477,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwOTczNzQ3Nw==","user":{"login":"phrocker","id":1781585,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODE1ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1781585?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phrocker","html_url":"https://github.com/phrocker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phrocker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phrocker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phrocker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phrocker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phrocker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phrocker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phrocker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phrocker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phrocker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-20T12:27:25Z","updated_at":"2017-06-20T12:27:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@matthpeterson I tend to agree with other commenters.

Is there any impact from this change on using 1.7.3 server with 1.7.4 client and visa versa?\r\n\r\nThere is obviously the change in implementation that this introduces. However, I believe it is purely in the \"bugfix\" realm. If you ran my test without the KerberosToken patch, you'd get an error in KerberosToken about mis-matched principals -- if you squashed that, you would get a `GSS initiate failed` error when you try to make the Accumulo RPC. All of this comes from our poor handling of this scenario.\r\n\r\nTo the best of my knowledge, there wouldn't be any negative aspect to this change WRT cross-version support aside from the implicit change in how the clients operate. As long as the RPC was set up in such a way that it _could_ theoretically work (at the SASL/Kerberos level) it should continue to work.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/311180280/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/311185642","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/273#issuecomment-311185642","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/273","id":311185642,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMTE4NTY0Mg==","user":{"login":"joshelser","id":67863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3ODYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser","html_url":"https://github.com/joshelser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-26T21:21:46Z","updated_at":"2017-06-26T21:21:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Will
