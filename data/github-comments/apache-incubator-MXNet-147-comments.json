all, my current gut feeling is that this piece of functionality may be best provided as a standalone project, under a compatible and permissive license (most likely apache), so as to benefit other frameworks also.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that outside of TF Serving, there's not a lot out there. Deep Detect looks interesting @beniz, however it appears to be under the GPL license - can you please confirm?\r\n\r\n### Lambda / OpenWhisk\r\nLambda would almost certainly be a great option if it had GPU support, and Amazon will almost certainly provide this in the near future, whether via a different class of lambda or via their new elastic GPU offering (which may be slightly less suited here than the prior). This if of course not an open source solution, and as such may not be the ideal. This had me thinking about other options for implementing a simple, server-less method for hosting inference models, and I think [OpenWhisk](https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk) may suit here.\r\n\r\n### GPU Compatibility \r\nI can't find validation that it works on GPUs, however their generic action invocation appears to run an arbitrary binary via [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/), which I've used with cuda in the past with some success. I'll spin up an OpenWhisk VM on my GPU box and report back as to whether or not GPUs are accessible, however it's not immediately obvious to me why it shouldn't be.\r\n\r\n### Simplification\r\nFrom there, I think making use of the amalgamation script/s within Mxnet  to provide a simple 'runnable' object may be a good approach to providing a simple deployment process to users. This will obviously need performance testing.\r\n\r\n### Mxnet Integration\r\nI think this could prove to be a powerful tool for many ML frameworks, with MxNet serving as the foundation in places. Perhaps this would best be its own project/repository, mirrored within and closely integrating with Mxnet? Thoughts on this are much appreciated.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know your thoughts, and once I've validated some of the moving pieces, particuarly GPU support on OpenWhisk, I'll knock together a design proposal for further

Strictly speaking, their execution order is *undefined*, leaving chances for parallelism. FIFO is just our current way of selecting the order, but there is also other orders (like the order based on pushed order) that *may* better than it. Ideally, we should have a global analysis of the whole dag using dynamic programming to find the priority that best saves memory as Eric once suggested. \r\n\r\n@howard0su about the stability, since FIFO is just one alternative, strict FIFO is not required for execution. I think the more critical problem is whether priority queue is fast enough for tiny operators. I tested rnn (written in purely ndarray) with 64 batch size and 512 hidden layer size with 50 unrolling steps, the change does not affect the execution speed. For symbolic execution, it should be better since each operator is more costly and there are fewer of them. However, this requires further investigation.\r\n\r\nThe PR is not meant for merge. Instead, the branch is for future changes that @piiswrong is also looking at.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/270163591/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/270168525","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/4502#issuecomment-270168525","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/4502","id":270168525,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MDE2ODUyNQ==","user":{"login":"ctongfei","id":5746409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDY0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5746409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctongfei","html_url":"https://github.com/ctongfei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctongfei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctongfei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctongfei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctongfei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctongfei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctongfei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctongfei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctongfei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctongfei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-03T17:18:24Z","updated_at":"2017-01-03T17:18:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"solved. my fault.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/270168525/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/270171171","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/4495#issuecomment-270171171","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/4495","id":270171171,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MDE3MTE3MQ==","user":{"login":"jermainewang","id":4057701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNTc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4057701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jermainewang","html_url":"https://github.com/jermainewang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jermainewang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jermainewang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jermainewang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jermainewang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jermainewang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jermainewang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jermainewang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jermainewang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jermainewang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-03T17:29:20Z","updated_at":"2017-01-03T17:29:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"About the order, I always mean the dispatch order.

(need a smart way to handle order overflow)\r\n2.
