Only reshaping when shapes change helps a bit.\n- Inlining execution (when you can guarantee that all dependencies of a child operator have concluded whe executing a parent, running the child directly instead of throwing back into a job queue) helps a lot for some networks.\n- Specifically for convolutional networks on Haswell or above Intel CPUs at reasonable batch sizes (>32 or so), using NNPACK helps a lot (see https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/issues/4264 for an example integration).
