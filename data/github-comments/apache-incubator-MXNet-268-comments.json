The code logic is OK since I already made it work for 0.11.3, but not for 0.12. That's why I started this thread. I cannot find anything useful from source code of python api. And I debugged and found the difference after [executing graph](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/396943e22661f03867d103d134416541e7e4f2bb/python/mxnet/gluon/block.py#L394). For 0.12, the grad that I attached disappears after this line, which is not for 0.11.3.\r\n\r\nBy the way, here is the rough logic of my code:\r\n\r\n1. Build pre-trained network vgg.\r\n2. Get inputs and outputs symbols that are interested.\r\n3. Use those inputs and outputs to build SymbolBlock.\r\n4. Open autograd.record(), attach the grad for input, and feed the input to the SymbolBlock created above. Lastly, compute the loss and do grad. \r\n\r\nIn theory, I should get a correct grad for input (that's how it works in 0.11.3), but it's broken in 0.12.

If you instead execute 'export MXNET_MODULE_SEED=42' then a random number generator seeded by 42 will provide the sequence of RNG seeds for the tests of each module (i.e. file). If your tests pass in this mode, they will do so repeatedly since every test's seed is deterministic. \n\nI'm hoping that most people will want to run with no environment variables set. Yes, that means that the tests will get different seeds each time, but those seeds are known and printed out for any test that throws an exception. Even a core-dump can be reproduced in isolation by rerunning the module first with the same seed in a debug mode. So far, this methodology has made it easy for me to track down and fix many of our test's random failures. Most often this has been a case of too-small tolerances or issues with use of the finite difference method, but not always! I'm hoping this PR will be incorporated and will lead to a stronger framework. \n\n----- Original Message -----\n\nFrom: \"Marco de Abreu\" <notifications@github.com> \nTo: \"apache/incubator-mxnet\" <incubator-mxnet@noreply.github.com> \nCc: \"Dick Carter\" <dick.carter@comcast.net>, \"Mention\" <mention@noreply.github.com> \nSent: Sunday, November 5, 2017 2:47:07 PM \nSubject: Re: [apache/incubator-mxnet] Ci test randomness2 (#8526) \n\n\n\nHello @DickJC123 , interesting idea! Do you also support the possibility to set a global seed which will be set for each test before it is getting executed? Right now, the only way I see is adding @with_seed(1234) to every single test. My goal is to have a completely deterministic and reproducible behaviour during test execution by using the exact same seed for every single test without having to alter the code. \n\n— \nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned. \nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub , or mute the thread . \n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/342017028/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/342017876","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/8545#issuecomment-342017876","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/8545","id":342017876,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MjAxNzg3Ng==","user":{"login":"ironfrown","id":6309054,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMDkwNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6309054?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ironfrown","html_url":"https://github.com/ironfrown","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ironfrown/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ironfrown/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ironfrown/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ironfrown/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ironfrown/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ironfrown/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ironfrown/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ironfrown/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ironfrown/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-06T00:15:05Z","updated_at":"2017-11-06T00:18:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I have noticed that instructions for the Python installation were to load MXNET 0.11.0, which worked well.
