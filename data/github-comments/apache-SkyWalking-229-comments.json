@darcydai Could you give an explanation of the relationship between this and `mm2`\r\n\r\nYes. basically, there two have no relationship.  reference #5949, mm2 is MirrorMake 2,  a cross-cluster sync data tool.  the topic name of another cluster will add a prefix of origin topic. mm2 works with OAP server aims to add prefix then consumer another Kafka cluster data(sync from another Kafka cluster). namespace aims to isolate the OAP cluster when using the same Kafka cluster, like the namespace in Elasticsearch. although there two do the same work, add a prefix of the topic.  \r\n\r\n if have no namespace we need to config too many items for the topic name.\r\n\r\nexample:\r\n```properties\r\nplugin.kafka.namespace=op-test\r\n````\r\nis the same like
