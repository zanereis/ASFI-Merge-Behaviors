Threads can't be shared among enclaves, so a thread must exit one enclave before working in another. A two-level task queue, ensures that each enclaves gets threads while the system doesn't go over its thread allotment.\r\n\r\nRight now, a main issue I'm encountering is that `ThreadPool` is very tightly coupled to the operations it performs.

An issue that I've run into is that now the conv2d schedules use GenericFunc in a way that doesn't work well if it goes via a PackedFunc. The first issue is the workload argument to _get_schedule overrides gets converted to an `Array<Expr>` when passed into C++. This is easily remedied with the following modification:\r\n```\r\n@_get_schedule.register(\"rasp\")\r\ndef _schedule_conv2d(wkl):\r\n    # wkl gets converted to array by GenericFunc system\r\n    wkl = [x.value if isinstance(x, tvm.expr.ConstExpr) else x for x in wkl]\r\n    wkl = Workload(*wkl)\r\n    if wkl not in _WORKLOADS:\r\n        raise ValueError(\"no schedule for such workload: {}\".format(wkl))\r\n    idx = _WORKLOADS.index(wkl)\r\n    sch = _SCHEDULES[idx]\r\n    return sch\r\n```\r\nand with a corresponding modification for x86. However, the bigger issue is with the sch that is returned from these functions. Since these are named tuples, decoding the return value fails with \"PackedFunction can only support one return value\" in _ffi\\_ctypes\\function.py line 62. Essentially for this to work the schedules need to be packed in a way that will work across PackedFunc boundaries. The simplest way I can think of doing this is for there to be an encoder/decoder function pair that packs the schedules into a dictionary, along with a \"type\" field (eg. SpatialPack, AVXConv1x1Fwd, etc). This does mean that the decoder must be aware of every type of schedule, and every invocation of _get_schedule must pass through the decoder. Does this sound like a reasonable way to approach this? or can you think of a better way?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/372423700/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/372432707","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/991#issuecomment-372432707","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/991","id":372432707,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MjQzMjcwNw==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-12T19:22:55Z","updated_at":"2018-03-12T19:28:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The original design intention was to make the thread pool specialized to FTVMParallelLambda so that we get the maximum benefit from data structure, without the additional cost of encapsulating generic task like std::function.\r\n\r\nTwo level thread-pool that is dynamically resizable is indeed a harder design goal than the original one.

I think I'll go this route initially (using the shared ThreadFactory).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/372441755/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/372452037","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/991#issuecomment-372452037","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/991","id":372452037,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MjQ1MjAzNw==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-12T20:30:32Z","updated_at":"2018-03-12T20:31:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I agree that thread creation and call into run_worker should be generic, as in the ThreadPoolLaunch proposal because the launch is one time cost.\r\n\r\nI think the original ThreadPoolLaunch proposal corresponds to the your ThreadFactory(actually i think this is a better name) \r\n\r\nThe only part that is the job specific is the per job push into thread queue\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/372452037/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/372467027","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/768#issuecomment-372467027","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/768","id":372467027,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MjQ2NzAyNw==","user":{"login":"wjtan99","id":29590928,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NTkwOTI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29590928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wjtan99","html_url":"https://github.com/wjtan99","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wjtan99/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wjtan99/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wjtan99/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wjtan99/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wjtan99/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wjtan99/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wjtan99/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wjtan99/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wjtan99/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-12T21:22:25Z","updated_at":"2018-03-12T21:22:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi, I changed config.mk to have  USE_BLAS = cblas\r\nbut I still had the same error.

level.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/373063656/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/373148340","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/991#issuecomment-373148340","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/991","id":373148340,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MzE0ODM0MA==","user":{"login":"nhynes","id":2353785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTM3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2353785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes","html_url":"https://github.com/nhynes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-14T19:35:42Z","updated_at":"2018-03-14T22:38:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> virtual table minimum\r\n\r\nShould be gone now. Thanks for the suggestions that led to the current implementation. There's still the issue of `std::function<void()>` but it's a one-time cost.\r\n\r\nRegarding an improved approach, I think that the following interface should be the goal:\r\n* single thread pool that assigns work to all available threads via ThreadGroup.Launch\r\n* single thread group that manages thread count and placement\r\n  * this should go in ThreadGroup rather than pool because this code will vary across platforms\r\n* enclave threads (which require affinity) would land in the enclave and stay there forever [sleeping when unused]\r\n  * this means that threads would be significantly over-allocated, but if the unused ones awaiting a lock, this shouldn't be a huge issue (I think)\r\n\r\nBasically, this means that the native pool does a single MaxCapacity launch and then adds MaxCapacity more for each new enclave.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/373148340/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
