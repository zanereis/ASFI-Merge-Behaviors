We always got that package because Newtonsoft.Json also had a dependency on it. However, Newtonsoft.Json seems to not use it anymore for .NET Standard 2.0:\r\n\r\n\r\n.NETStandard 1.3\r\n\r\n    Microsoft.CSharp (>= 4.3.0)\r\n    NETStandard.Library (>= 1.6.1)\r\n    System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter (>= 4.3.0)\r\n    System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters (>= 4.3.0)\r\n    System.Runtime.Serialization.Primitives (>= 4.3.0)\r\n    System.Xml.XmlDocument (>= 4.3.0)\r\n\r\n.NETStandard 2.0\r\n\r\n    No dependencies.\r\n\r\nSo, we're now getting errors for every use of `dynamic` with .NET Standard 2.0 as the target framework. I'm now adding a direct dependency on Microsoft.CSharp to Gremlin.Net. So, this can't happen again, even if Newtonsoft.Json would get completely rid of that dependency.\r\nWe already had that dependency before, it was only kind of _hidden_ behind our dependency on Newtonsoft.Json.\r\n\r\nedit: And since Newtonsoft.Json only added the .NET Standard 2.0 target in version 11, we didn't see the problem before with version 9.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/412572337/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/412598220","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/842#issuecomment-412598220","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/842","id":412598220,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMjU5ODIyMA==","user":{"login":"danielcweber","id":1899410,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTk0MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1899410?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweber","html_url":"https://github.com/danielcweber","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweber/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweber/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweber/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweber/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweber/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweber/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweber/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweber/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweber/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-13T17:27:35Z","updated_at":"2018-08-13T17:27:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for accepting the contribution!\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth, I am developing a [type-safe ORM](https://github.com/ExRam/ExRam.Gremlinq) (abusing the 'R' in ORM a bit ;-) on top of Gremlin.net, (among others).

I was reading through the current docs on \"Security\" and they seem insufficient:\r\n\r\nhttp://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/reference/#security\r\n\r\nsince you seem to have a good handle on some many of these SSL details, could you perhaps fix that section up a bit? Since we can no longer do `enableSsl` and get that self-signed cert, i think it would be helpful to users to have some additional/explicit instruction for getting SSL working.

From the looks of that groovy file, only the traversal files are generated. Are the other scripts in the repository handwritten? I'm actually in a situation very similar to @daem0ndev (writing a server in NestJS and looking for gremlin types). I ended up writing my own type declaration file for gremlin-javascript (it differs slightly from @daem0ndev's types). I wouldn't mind rewriting the entire gremlin-javascript package myself in TypeScript in order to give it native types (hehe, maybe I'm a little bit ahead of myself). It might still be beneficial to generate some TS files such as those mirroring the Traversal api. \r\n\r\nSide note: I was looking into implementing the GraphComputer portion of TinkerPop into this package before I saw this pull request on the mailing list (I'm not adept at using mailing lists yet).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/415371952/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/415403542","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/889#issuecomment-415403542","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/889","id":415403542,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNTQwMzU0Mg==","user":{"login":"jorgebay","id":2931196,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MzExOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2931196?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay","html_url":"https://github.com/jorgebay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-23T12:53:52Z","updated_at":"2018-08-23T12:53:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merged 🎉!
