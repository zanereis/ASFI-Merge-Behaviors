I suggest to change this to use h2 + embedded standalone hmaster as default for test to easy testing environment setup. I have naive version on this [commit](https://github.com/apache/incubator-s2graph/pull/112/commits/1a15af36b42909fff1aaf2fbacf23d01edfe6155)\r\n\r\n- S2GraphStructureIntegrateTest returns he StructureIntegrateSuite will not run for this Graph until it is publicly acknowledged with the @OptIn annotation on the Graph instance itself\r\n\r\nI think IntegrateTest is optional(based on [here](http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/dev/provider/#validating-with-gremlin-test)). I am still struggling to pass `StructureStandardSuite`(not many green yet) and I think once I am done with`StructureStandardSuite` then start dig it. \r\n\r\nI think best way to get started is running `StructureStandardSuite` and find out failed cases and debug them and you can start work by comment out @Graph.OptOuts(S2Graph.scala:532). \r\n\r\nMany test cases in `StructureStandardSuite`  expect their own Edge/Vertex/Property schema with specific data, so figuring out schema then place them under `S2GraphProvider.loadGraphData`, then comment out that OptOut, then debug it...It may not right way, but since I have very limited knowledge on gremlin-test, I was learning in this hard way. happy to learn better way.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-s2graph/issues/comments/284153302/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-s2graph/issues/comments/284241027","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-s2graph/pull/112#issuecomment-284241027","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-s2graph/issues/112","id":284241027,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NDI0MTAyNw==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-05T16:26:13Z","updated_at":"2017-03-05T16:26:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Just a quick note to mention that as of TinkerPop 3.2.4 all the groovy related test suites are now deprecated:\r\n\r\nhttp://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/3.2.4/upgrade/#_deprecated_optin\r\n\r\nThat should save you a few tests to worry about implementing.

Grok UDF\r\nIn addition, I created Grok Udf class that is using grok library for parsing some text.\r\nThe Grok Udf have some parameters\r\n```\r\npatternDir : grok pattern file base directory\r\npatternFiles : grok pattern files\r\ncompilePattern : pattern name to use\r\nschema: result data schema, if not exist it will return map type\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor example, I added two type of udf for parsing s2graph application log message.\r\nBoth udf uses a grok file stored in a specific path of hdfs, and differ only in the compile pattern.\r\n(each udf parses only the text that matches the compile pattern.)\r\n```\r\nudfs: [\r\n      {\r\n        name: grok_s2app_expr\r\n        class: org.apache.s2graph.s2jobs.udfs.Grok\r\n        params: {\r\n          patternDir:
