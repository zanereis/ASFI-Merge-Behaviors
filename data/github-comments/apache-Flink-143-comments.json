Enforcing to use the address was possible, enforcing to use the hostname not.\r\n\r\n  - More importantly: IPv6 has multiple valid representations of the same address. If different nodes have the same address but represent it as a string differently, the messages would not arrive. That's why we have a \"normalizing\" encoding step that makes sure all URLs would be the same. That step relied on translating \r\n\r\nI see two dangers now that may occur:\r\n  - If different parts of the code or the JDK do a subtle change of behavior (i.e. resolve the InetAddress), then some nodes may have a hostname in the URL, others an address.\r\n\r\n  - If two machines have a slightly different network configuration (especially concerning preferences to represent/encode IPv6 addresses) and the users set the IP address as the JobManager host, then they might create different Akka URLs and the machines cannot talk to each other again.\r\n\r\nI am a bit unsure how to proceed from here. Is there any way we can keep using IP addresses in the Akka URLs? Or does that just inherently not make sense with \"dynamic hostnames\" as they are used in container environments?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/264263817/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/264267409","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2766#issuecomment-264267409","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2766","id":264267409,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NDI2NzQwOQ==","user":{"login":"EronWright","id":1775518,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzU1MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1775518?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EronWright","html_url":"https://github.com/EronWright","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EronWright/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EronWright/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EronWright/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EronWright/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EronWright/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EronWright/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EronWright/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EronWright/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EronWright/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-01T19:22:13Z","updated_at":"2016-12-01T19:22:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@uce it would be nice to get this PR in, to counteract the growing duplication of Netty code in the codebase.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/264267409/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/264272073","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2762#issuecomment-264272073","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2762","id":264272073,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NDI3MjA3Mw==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-01T19:38:52Z","updated_at":"2016-12-01T19:39:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The `String -> String` mapping would be a name mapping of fields from the `GenericRecord` to `Row` attributes.

Do you have any suggestions?\r\n\r\n2. You suggested that \"creating a new ByteArrayInputStream and Decoder for each record is quite expensive\". I don't see a way how to do this. The problem is that to create Decoder I need to pass an instance of an InputStream, but when an ByteArrayInputStream is created its content cannot be changed. Therefore a new instance of ByteArrayInputStream should be created for each message.\r\n\r\nI think I can create a different implementation of InputStream that allows to set a buffer (let's call it `MutableByteArrayInputStream`). Then we can create one instance of `MutableByteArrayInputStream` and just call `inputStream.setBuffer(message)` for every message that should be deserialized. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/264430082/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/264430603","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2886#issuecomment-264430603","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2886","id":264430603,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NDQzMDYwMw==","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-02T11:07:50Z","updated_at":"2016-12-02T11:07:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"That should be possible; I'll look into it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/264430603/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/264431450","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2917#issuecomment-264431450","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2917","id":264431450,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NDQzMTQ1MA==","user":{"login":"mxm","id":837221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNzIyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/837221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm","html_url":"https://github.com/mxm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-02T11:12:42Z","updated_at":"2016-12-02T11:12:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for checking out the code!\r\n\r\n>If different parts of the code or the JDK do a subtle change of behavior (i.e. resolve the InetAddress), then some nodes may have a hostname in the URL, others an address.\r\n\r\nFair point. Let's remove InetAddress and use a String instead.\r\n\r\n>If two machines have a slightly different network configuration (especially concerning preferences to represent/encode IPv6 addresses) and the users set the IP address as the JobManager host, then they might create different Akka URLs and the machines cannot talk to each other again.\r\n\r\nA problem of the old method was that hostnames might resolve differently depending on the container context. So that method was not reliable either. Using IP addresses will work with the new method. They just have to be consistent on all node configurations. I don't think that is a problem because a configuration is usually created once and then copied over to all nodes.\r\n\r\n>I am a bit unsure how to proceed from here. Is there any way we can keep using IP addresses in the Akka URLs? Or does that just inherently not make sense with \"dynamic hostnames\" as they are used in container environments?\r\n\r\nFor this PR to address the core problems of FLINK-2821, we have to avoid resolving the hostname because the IP address would represent the internal container address which may be unreachable from the outside; even if it were resolvable, Akka would drop the messages because of its exact URL match policy. Using the hostname which now acts as a purely logical address ultimately is a more reliable way across different network environments. We just have to make sure we document the new requirement that the JobManager address (JOB_MANAGER_IPC_ADDRESS) is consistent across all Flink cluster nodes.\r\n

The following should be addressed before merging though:\r\n- Add tests to `EventSerializerTest` with all currently available events (including `OTHER_EVENT` instances).\r\n- As a special case it's important to make sure that the ByteBuffer position indexes are not affected by doing a `isEvent` check, because a following deserialization will fail otherwise. The following example fails because of this:\r\n\r\n  ```java\r\n  ByteBuffer serializedEvent = EventSerializer.toSerializedEvent(EndOfPartitionEvent.INSTANCE);\r\n  assertTrue(EventSerializer.isEvent(serializedEvent, EndOfPartitionEvent.class, cl));\r\n  EndOfPartitionEvent event = (EndOfPartitionEvent) EventSerializer.fromSerializedEvent(serializedEvent, cl);\r\n  ```\r\n  For `Buffer` instances it works, because `Buffer#getNioBuffer()` always wraps the memory in a new `ByteBuffer` instance. For the tests, this can be covered by serializing an event, doing the `isEvent` check on the serialized buffer and then trying to deserialize the same serialized event buffer (like above).\r\n- The check is not used in `LocalInputChannel` any more, but only in `PartitionRequestQueue`. Let's move it there.\r\n- In general the EventSerializer interface could be made a little less overloaded by only exposing one variant (Buffer/ByteBuffer). That's indepedent of this issue though.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/264702225/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/264706380","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2829#issuecomment-264706380","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2829","id":264706380,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NDcwNjM4MA==","user":{"login":"uce","id":1756620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTY2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1756620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce","html_url":"https://github.com/uce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-04T14:15:47Z","updated_at":"2016-12-04T14:16:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Good additions with the Javadocs.
