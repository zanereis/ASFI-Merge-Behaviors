The system on which the action container is running does not support memory limits.\r\n2. The test action does not exceed the memory limit because memory management works in an unexpected way.\r\n\r\n#### Missing memory limit support\r\n\r\n@houshengbo please run the `docker info` command on the system. Can you please paste the output to this issue? Does Docker warn about missing features?\r\n\r\nFollow Docker's troubleshooting procedure: https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/#troubleshooting. Namely, please run script `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker/docker/master/contrib/check-config.sh` and paste the output to this issue. Is there any support missing around memory cgroups?\r\n\r\n#### Test does not exceed memory limit\r\n\r\nThe test output from above contains `rss: 119693312`. I would expected a much higher value... According to the output, the action code is expected to allocate 8192 blocks of `Uint8Array` with size 32768. This should be 256 MiB - exceeding the limit of 128 MiB RSS. Probably, the action code does not lead to enough RSS consumption. Maybe the system uses memory compression or other techniques to save RSS?\r\n\r\nMaybe we need to adapt following code portion to write more random numbers to memory pages?
