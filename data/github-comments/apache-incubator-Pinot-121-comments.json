We should allow overriding existing segment, but not the newly pushed ones.\r\n\r\nIf user wants to replace an existing segment, he/she can still use the current logic to do that. I've update the logic of the PR to validate the number of input and output files. Since there is 1:1 mapping between the input and output files, if these two number doesn't match, we should fail the job. \r\nThe previous logic that sets `overwrite` flag doesn't work as the destination is just a temp dir for each of the mapper. The actual merge step from mapper temp dir to final output dir is done inside the `commitTask` method of `FileOutputCommitter` class, which is out of the scope of our MR job.\r\n\r\nSample log from

The concept of `numPartitions` and `numInstancesPerPartition` is only applicable to replica group based instance assignment.\r\n\r\nWe can consider fixing this -- will have to discuss the semantics of interpreting numReplicaGroups in a couple of places in the code. When assigning instances in replica group based manner at the time of table creation, we don't check numReplicaGroups=1 and proceed with replica group based instance assignment. Ideally we should have failed here itself. Instead we proceed to assign instances to a single replica group. \r\n\r\nHowever, at the time of table rebalance we interpret numReplicaGroups=1 as non-replica group based and throw error if numPartitions is != 1\r\n\r\nFor now if you really want to create a replica group based table with a single replica group, you can use the legacy way of specifying replica group assignment strategy in the table config","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1027723877/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1027765724","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/8055#issuecomment-1027765724","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/8055","id":1027765724,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c49QnXc","user":{"login":"lksvenoy-r7","id":46895578,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2ODk1NTc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46895578?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lksvenoy-r7","html_url":"https://github.com/lksvenoy-r7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lksvenoy-r7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lksvenoy-r7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lksvenoy-r7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lksvenoy-r7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lksvenoy-r7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lksvenoy-r7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lksvenoy-r7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lksvenoy-r7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lksvenoy-r7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-02T09:57:37Z","updated_at":"2022-02-02T09:57:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you.

I would imagine that the installations that need protection against new segments being pushed simultaneously (for whatever reason) will want to do so for all requests and all tables.\r\n\r\nI agree that making this a controller config would be ideal. But here are the concerns with doing that in the current implementation:\r\n1. \"enableParallelPushProtection\" is an existing parameter (not derived from http header) in the REST API call. But it's being used only for existing segments. This patch extends that to work for new segments as well.  That means that there could be some customers (scripts, curl commands, etc) using this API parameter currently.\r\n2. Removing the existing \"enableParallelPushProtection\" parameter from the API is not possible (for backward compatibility) without deprecating the API. At the same time, having both controller config and a parameter will get hairy in terms of code-handling, readability and customer usage.\r\n\r\nGiven these concerns, I feel that it would be better to address this as a TODO in the future as follows:\r\n1. Deprecate existing UploadSegment APIs. Introduce new API without the parameter.\r\n2. Introduce a controller config option and extend code to use the config to provide parallel push protection\r\n\r\nThoughts?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1028397694/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1028399206","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/8109#issuecomment-1028399206","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/8109","id":1028399206,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c49TCBm","user":{"login":"Jackie-Jiang","id":17555551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTU1NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17555551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang","html_url":"https://github.com/Jackie-Jiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-02T22:01:39Z","updated_at":"2022-02-02T22:01:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> CONFIG_OF_TASK_AUTH_TOKEN is actually consistent between server/minion, but w/o component prefix. lemme know if that's concerning and will update.\r\n\r\nSure, we can fix it separately","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1028399206/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1028462180","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/8074#issuecomment-1028462180","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/8074","id":1028462180,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c49TRZk","user":{"login":"Jackie-Jiang","id":17555551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTU1NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17555551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang","html_url":"https://github.com/Jackie-Jiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-02T23:41:30Z","updated_at":"2022-02-02T23:41:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @Jackie-Jiang How will you deal with the new input `hllLog2m=8;hllConversionThreshold=10` when we fall back to the new function with config?
