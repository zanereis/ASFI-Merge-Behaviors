That makes following the changes much easier. These commits will be squashed before merging to the master branch.\n- I am not sure if we are talking about the same thing. Robert suggested to move the code for reading inputs into the main method for examples that have only a single input such as TwitterStream or WordCount. This is the point we discussed before. Usually, there is only one parameter to check, i.e., whether an input path was provided or not. We do not need to move that into a `checkParameters` method, IMO.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/180279675/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/180283281","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1590#issuecomment-180283281","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1590","id":180283281,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MDI4MzI4MQ==","user":{"login":"rmetzger","id":89049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger","html_url":"https://github.com/rmetzger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-05T10:12:06Z","updated_at":"2016-02-05T10:12:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks like one test needs to be adopted\n\n```\ntestCheckpointing(org.apache.flink.streaming.connectors.kafka.Kafka08ITCase)  Time elapsed: 0.194 sec  <<< ERROR!\njava.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: null\n    at org.apache.flink.streaming.connectors.kafka.testutils.MockRuntimeContext.getUserCodeClassLoader(MockRuntimeContext.java:101)\n    at org.apache.flink.streaming.connectors.kafka.FlinkKafkaConsumer08.open(FlinkKafkaConsumer08.java:254)\n    at org.apache.flink.streaming.connectors.kafka.KafkaConsumerTestBase.runCheckpointingTest(KafkaConsumerTestBase.java:177)\n    at org.apache.flink.streaming.connectors.kafka.Kafka08ITCase.testCheckpointing(Kafka08ITCase.java:45)\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/180283281/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/180284317","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1566#issuecomment-180284317","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1566","id":180284317,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MDI4NDMxNw==","user":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-05T10:17:20Z","updated_at":"2016-02-05T10:17:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think the PR is still not in a good shape.

I also had a discussion with @StephanEwen and he came up with the name `rescale()` for this distribution pattern. The reasoning is that you basically increase or decrease/increase the parallelism of downstream operations by some factor x and elements from the upstream operation will be sent only to x downstream operations to which no other upstream operation sends elements. It should be clear from the picture what I mean by that exactly. We have a source with parallelism 3, then a map with parallelism 9 and then the sink has parallelism 3 again.\n<img width=\"1986\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-02-05 at 11 18 16\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/68551/12843516/3d509ab6-cbfa-11e5-850d-d4cd25f08de5.png\">\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/180284761/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/180286078","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1578#issuecomment-180286078","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1578","id":180286078,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MDI4NjA3OA==","user":{"login":"uce","id":1756620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTY2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1756620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce","html_url":"https://github.com/uce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-05T10:25:34Z","updated_at":"2016-02-05T10:25:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Did anyone have time to check this out?

But before I think we should still change three things.\n\nThe first thing I would like to change is the `JobType`. I feel a bit uneasy adding explicit information whether a job is a streaming or a batch job to the `JobGraph`. So far we've succeeded in keeping the runtime agnostic to the type of job. I would propose to change it to a `stoppable` flag. Thus, indicating whether the job is stoppable or not. Semantically, it should not make a big difference.\n\nThe second thing I would propose is to remove `stop` from the `StreamSource` class in order to make it not mandatory for all streaming sources to be stoppable. Instead I would also introduce a `StoppableOperator` interface which can be implemented by streaming sources which are in fact stoppable. I'm not so sure, for example, whether the Kafka sources are properly stoppable without throwing exceptions. By introducing this interface we can selectively implement stop methods for sources. A nice side effect is that existing code won't break if you have a custom source implementation.\n\nAnd as a last point I would propose to automatically infer whether a job is stoppable or not. What we have to do is to check that all source functions implement the `StoppableOperator` interface. This should be doable in the `StreamGraphGenerator`. Based on this information we can then set the stoppable flag in the `JobGraph` or not.\n\nWhat do you think? Would that be feasible?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/180617867/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/180679993","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1580#issuecomment-180679993","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1580","id":180679993,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MDY3OTk5Mw==","user":{"login":"subhankarb","id":2178361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzgzNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2178361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/subhankarb","html_url":"https://github.com/subhankarb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/subhankarb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/subhankarb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/subhankarb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/subhankarb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/subhankarb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/subhankarb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/subhankarb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/subhankarb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/subhankarb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-06T04:38:43Z","updated_at":"2016-02-06T07:07:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rmetzger when i started i had only pubsub in my mind. today i thought about added list for sink+source and sorted set, hash and set for sink only. i'll update the pull req.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/180679993/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/180746275","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1580#issuecomment-180746275","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1580","id":180746275,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MDc0NjI3NQ==","user":{"login":"rmetzger","id":89049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger","html_url":"https://github.com/rmetzger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-06T11:57:48Z","updated_at":"2016-02-06T11:57:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"How do you want to implement this?

for the long delay. I still don't really have time for this, but I wan't to describe it anyways. That's why the writing and formatting is pretty sloppy in this. Sorry for that, I hope you bare with me:\n\nWe only consider isotonic regression on weighted, two dimensional data. Thus, datapoints are tuples of three doubles: `(y, x, w)`.\n\nPAV assumes the data to be sorted by `x`. It starts on the left and goes to the right. Whenever two Point's (or more) are found that are descending in order of `x`, it \"pools\" them, which means all `y` values (multiplied by their weight) in that pool are averaged by the sum of all weights. Any point in the pool then looks like this: `(y_weighted_pool_avg, x, w)`. Because the `y` values where changed, we have to look back in `x` order if the new pool avg is lower than the value before the pool. If that's the case, we have to pool again until now higher `y` value is present before the pool.\n\nAny sequence of data points from `i` to `j` sharing the same `y` value is compressed in the following way: `(y, x_i, sum_of_weights), (y, x_j, 0)`. The hope of Sparks implementation is that enough data gets compressed that way, that all remaining data fits into one node in the last step. However, there are of course cases, where this simply doesn't work.\n\nOur approach (not implemented in this PR) works like this:\n\n```\ncompare two consecutive data points i and j:\nif y_i < y_j, leave them untouched\nif y_i > y_j, replace both with ((y_i * w_i + y_j * w_j) / (w_i + w_j), x_i, w_i + w_j). Also remember x_j\nif y_i = y_j, replace both with (y_i, x_i, w_i + w_j). Also remember x_j\nRepeat that until no pairs are combined to one\n```\n\nAfter the iteration terminated: Foreach point that has a \"remembered\" `x_j`, add another `(y, x_j, 0)` directly behind it.\n\nWe are able to compare each point with its successor, by attaching each point with an index (zipWithIndex) and a \"next-pointer\" (index+1) and then doing a:\n`set.join(set).where(next).equalTo(index)`\nHowever, because of the weight summation, we must avoid that a point appears in multiple join pairs. Otherwise a point's weight might be summed into multiple combined points.\n\nWe worked around that by doing two joins in each iteration step:\n\n```\nstep 1: left join side has only points with even indices, right side only with odd\nstep 2: left join side has only points with odd indices, right side only with even\nif nothing happened during these two runs, we are done\n```\n\nUnfortunately, because of the merging the indices are not incrementing by 1 anymore. That's why we wanted to apply another zipWithIndex after the two joins, but the join repartitioned the data, so we loose our range-partitioning. But, this is required to get indices representing the total order of the data.\n\nI hope you can understand the problem. Again sorry for sloppy writing. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/180798486/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/180842858","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1594#issuecomment-180842858","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1594","id":180842858,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MDg0Mjg1OA==","user":{"login":"mbalassi","id":5990983,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5OTA5ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5990983?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi","html_url":"https://github.com/mbalassi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-06T19:28:37Z","updated_at":"2016-02-06T19:28:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/180842858/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/180847040","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1588#issuecomment-180847040","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1588","id":180847040,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MDg0NzA0MA==","user":{"login":"kl0u","id":2405800,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDU4MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2405800?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u","html_url":"https://github.com/kl0u","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-06T19:55:20Z","updated_at":"2016-02-06T19:55:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks a lot for the comments @rmetzger and @StephanEwen .\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/180847040/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/180943918","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/757#issuecomment-180943918","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/757","id":180943918,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MDk0MzkxOA==","user":{"login":"sachingoel0101","id":8874261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NzQyNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8874261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101","html_url":"https://github.com/sachingoel0101","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-07T04:13:14Z","updated_at":"2016-02-07T04:13:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the review.
