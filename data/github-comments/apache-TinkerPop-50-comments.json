We are currently starting the release process for 3.4.3 so this PR is probably headed for 3.4.4 or later at this point.

An alternative approach would simply throw a meaningful exception directly in the `WebSocketConnection` class where you currently check whether the connection was closed. That would of course again rely on exception handling to deal with this error, but I'm not even sure if that isn't the most appropriate approach here as that really is an error case in my opinion which justifies exception handling.\r\n\r\nBoth approaches terminate waiting requests and notify users about the occurred exception which is the right approach in my opinion. The fact the Cosmos DB for some reason just seems to close connections that we still consider to be active is a different problem that we need to address separately from this problem of getting a hard to understand `NullReferenceException`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/521284216/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/521597606","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1179#issuecomment-521597606","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1179","id":521597606,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMTU5NzYwNg==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-15T10:37:28Z","updated_at":"2019-08-15T10:37:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for offering this update - I saw this project a while back and forgot to do it. \r\n\r\nVOTE +1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/521597606/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/521773537","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1176#issuecomment-521773537","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1176","id":521773537,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMTc3MzUzNw==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-15T19:51:02Z","updated_at":"2019-08-15T19:51:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Note that Travis is failing and it seems related to this change.

This merge request is ready for reviewing. It basically follows the same idea as your previous work in the TINKERPOP-2132 branch, which has been there for a while, but is not merged for some reason I wander. \r\n\r\nIn this commit, I added a step that sends a validation request at the end of the constructor of `Connection`. So, we don't have to introduce a new message or change the client code to use a new channalizer. I also changed the exception handling of validation, so that `ResponseException`s do not fail the validation,  because in the case when `strictTransactionManagement` is enabled, the validation fails for sure with a `ResponseException`, but the client is still ok for correctly built messages with explicit aliases.\r\n\r\nThere are some other points I think may worth a change but not included in this commit in order to minimize the modifications.\r\n1. The TimeoutException thrown when no host is available is a little bit misleading. Maybe a specialized `NoHostAvailableException` is better.\r\n2. It's a commonly used pattern to catch checked exceptions and wrap them in `RuntimeException`s and re-throw.

It introduced a breaking change to the Gremlin Server protocol to properly fix it and I didn't want to do that for 3.3.x or 3.4.x. I think it would be best if we could avoid that if at all possible as it means previous versions of the driver won't be able to connect along those release lines.\r\n\r\n> In this commit, I added a step that sends a validation request at the end of the constructor of Connection.\r\n\r\nSo, I suppose this approach is a possible solution. You eagerly do the authentication operation of the `Connection` by way of a validation message. I guess that the `Connection` does the websocket handshake in the constructor, so immediately sending a validation message to force authentication might not have bad consequences. It's not an elegant solution, but if this problem is really bothering people and no other non-breaking solutions can be found then I suppose we could go with it ([assuming the tests](https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1187#discussion_r320410110) show this fix actually does solve the problem).\r\n\r\n> not included in this commit in order to minimize the modifications.\r\n\r\nThank you - that is appreciated.\r\n\r\n> The TimeoutException thrown when no host is available is a little bit misleading. Maybe a specialized NoHostAvailableException is better.\r\n\r\nI think i made a note about that elsewhere in my review. The `TimeoutException` isn't so good. \r\n\r\n> It's a commonly used pattern to catch checked exceptions and wrap them in RuntimeExceptions and re-throw\r\n\r\nYeah - I think the exception handling could be better. The generalized `RuntimeException` isn't so nice. It would be nice to make that better if we could introduce improvements without breaking changes, but that seems hard at this point. It might need to wait until 3.5.0...not sure.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/527587888/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/527593941","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1108#issuecomment-527593941","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1108","id":527593941,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNzU5Mzk0MQ==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-03T19:01:02Z","updated_at":"2019-09-03T19:01:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Basically [this comment](https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1108#issuecomment-489690861) summarizes reasoning and direction with this one at this point.

In the extreme case where the user configures the pool to use just one connection with a high number of parallel requests for that connection, the situation can occur that some writes have to wait for a long time because new writes come in and are executed first.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/527880492/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/527888714","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1115#issuecomment-527888714","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1115","id":527888714,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNzg4ODcxNA==","user":{"login":"danielcweber","id":1899410,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTk0MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1899410?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweber","html_url":"https://github.com/danielcweber","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweber/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweber/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweber/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweber/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweber/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweber/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweber/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweber/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweber/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-04T12:58:17Z","updated_at":"2019-09-04T12:58:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"So

So the direction here is: No locks in any code in the driver nor in the framework classes it uses?\r\n\r\nNo, I wouldn't go so far to ban locks completely from all code in the driver, including its dependencies. The recently introduced `CopyOnWriteCollection` for example [also uses locks](https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/c951abe4a80a3df59e46f70c8265100f00cf22a3/gremlin-dotnet/src/Gremlin.Net/Driver/CopyOnWriteCollection.cs#L41) (so the driver isn't completely lock-free, strictly speaking). I think that's ok in this case as it only needs locks to change the size of the collection, so for resizing operations of the connection pool. We want to move these operations out of the usual execution flow of requests as much as possible, ideally they are only performed by dedicated tasks executed in the background (and only in error cases).\r\nIf we have a good reason to introduce locks in the driver (and we're confident that it won't lead to deadlocks and only block threads for such a small time period that it's basically neglectable), then we can do so in my opinion.\r\n\r\nFor this specific PR, I'm not really convinced yet that the benefit of making the code easier to reason about warrants the added lock, especially because the lock needs to be acquired for every request and because this solution comes with the other disadvantage I mentioned about not having a guaranteed order with the `SemaphoreSlim`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/527934552/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/528185126","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1187#issuecomment-528185126","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1187","id":528185126,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyODE4NTEyNg==","user":{"login":"thirstycrow","id":1327305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjczMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1327305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirstycrow","html_url":"https://github.com/thirstycrow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirstycrow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirstycrow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirstycrow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirstycrow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirstycrow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirstycrow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirstycrow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirstycrow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirstycrow/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-05T03:52:01Z","updated_at":"2019-09-05T03:52:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"All the tests passed except the last one.
