I took some more time with this and figured out a way to add example properties to Property.java. \r\n\r\nI didn't want to add defaultValues for properties that we actually didn't want set.\r\nThere has been code before that checks to see if the user set the property and only does things if that is true vs the property being in the default configuration. \r\n\r\nThat pattern seems to add additional complexity to our code while also confusing users who might set the property just because we have it listed as a default and they want to hedge against the  property  changing in the default configuration. \r\n\r\nSo I added two things. The first is an `@Example` annotation which marks the property has an example prop. This means the property is excluded from the DefaultConfiguration generation and also adds different property documentation details. The second is another value field called `exampleValue`. This was done to ensure that if an annotation is mistakenly removed, the property still has no way of impacting a system.\r\n\r\nThe annotation must be removed, and the default value updated in order for the property to be included in the DefaultConfiguration.

The human-readable(editable) export file format is one that avoids adding any of that complexity into the import code/feature set. If import parameters are added instead, I think it would add more complexity baked in to Accumulo that users can already do with external text editing tools, so I'd prefer the change in the file format. But, if we do end up going the route of adding the ability to add import parameter overrides, it should be done in the most generic way possible (for example, adding a single option with an override map of parameter names and values is simpler and more extensible than adding separate options to override each import parameter separately).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1911191543/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
