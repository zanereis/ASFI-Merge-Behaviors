Let me answer some of your questions inline before attempting to debug the underlying root cause of duplicates. \r\n\r\n> **Expected behavior**\r\n> \r\n> Same behavior as Hudi 0.6 but now using the metadata table to track files/partitions. Happy to provide whatever info I can.\r\n> \r\n> Questions:\r\n> \r\n> 1. What is causing these duplicates to occur? Since no errors happened as far as I can tell, what info can I look at to debug/RCA? I’ve verified there are no duplicates (ie. checked some partitions) on 0.6 dataset.\r\nCan you check if the files from the dataset is the same as in the metadata table ? This would require you to \r\n\r\n1. Perform a listing on the entire dataset and get the unique files\r\n2. Read the metadata table and get the list of files from there\r\n3. Diff the 2 results to see if there are files in your dataset which are not present in the metadata table. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you have the logs from the first application where you turned on the `hoodie.metadata.enable` flag to true. Can you grep for the following log lines:\r\n\r\n`Creating a new metadata table in`\r\n`Initializing metadata table by using file listings in`\r\n`files to metadata`\r\n\r\nPlease share the output of the grep of the above lines. \r\n\r\n> 2. How can the metadata table be inspected? I can’t tell from https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/HUDI/RFC+-+15%3A+HUDI+File+Listing+Improvements\r\n\r\nYou can use the `MetadataCommand` to inspect this using the Hudi CLI. You can read about how to initialize the CLI here -> https://hudi.apache.org/docs/deployment.html#cli\r\n\r\n> 3. Should `hoodie.metadata.validate` be enabled? My understanding is this is a “dry run” config where S3 file listing will still happen as before while also updating the metadata table\r\n\r\nThat is correct. In this scenario, enabling that before the duplicates happened would've helped. But it doesn't help to enable this after the corruption has happened. At a high level, you don't need to enable it unless this issue is fully reproducible. \r\n\r\n> 4. How do we recover when duplicates occur? I see “records deduplicate” is suggested in https://hudi.apache.org/docs/deployment.html#duplicates (NB: seems like this should be “repair deduplicate”?), do we need to turn off ingestion first and then run over every affected partition?\r\n\r\nYes. You will need to turn off ingestion first before deduping. Unfortunately, this command is pretty old and has not been maintained since we don't see duplicate issues. You might need to re-bootstrap you dataset to recover this or start the shadow pipeline fresh. \r\n\r\n> 5. How do we recover if the metadata table is corrupted? Should we delete the existing metadata table from the CLI and recreate? Is this safe to do?\r\n\r\nYes. You can delete the existing metadata table using the CLI or manually but you need to stop ingestion during this time. It is safe to do this. Then, you should disable `hoodie.metadata.enable` if there is a corruption since the code may have had bug. After this, you can resume your pipeline. \r\n\r\n> 6. What upgrade path is suggested from 0.6 to 0.7 with metadata table enabled? Should the metadata table be created from the CLI pre-ingestion and then starting up the consumer after?\r\n\r\nAs long as you don't have concurrently running jobs, simply turning on the metadata table before the next ingestion run suffices.

Hudi only keeps track of what records have changed. This is known by the _hoodie_commit_time value between 2 records. It is not possible to identify whether the changes for the records were inserts/updates/deletes just by looking at this timestamp. \r\n\r\nHudi can only keep versions of data if the config is set to keep those many versions of the data. Suppose a record changes 10 times, this means 10 versions of that record were created. Now, only if the cleaner config ensures that 10 versions of the data are kept can Hudi allow for users to look at the historical values of the data. Hudi's incremental pull feature is not designed to provide a change log of all these 10 values, it is meant to provide the latest state of record since the last time you incrementally pulled. \r\n\r\nYes, hoodie.cleaner.fileversions.retained and hoodie.cleaner.commits.retained are independent of each other are are different cleaning policies.

point. \r\nTell me if my understanding is right in general wrt usage of timestamp based checkpointing. \r\nuser would like to use timestamp based checkpointing in deltastreamer only for bootstrap case. \r\nand further on, checkpointing will be using the regular kafka checkpoint format of \"topicName,0:123,1:456\". \r\n\r\nif my understanding (stated above) is true, essentially, within kafkaOffsenGen, we might have to parse checkpoint as timestamp for first time(bootstrap), but from 2nd time, we fallback to regular checkpoint parsing mechanism. \r\n\r\nI see we have InitialCheckPointProvider. Let me think about how to go about this and will get back to you. For now, this is what I can think of. \r\nInitialCheckpointProvider will expose getCheckpointType() method. \r\nand we add it as a property to configs if initialCheckpointProvider is set around [here](https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/f6eee77636223077cfd2ce516f1b8805dfa6e35e/hudi-utilities/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/utilities/deltastreamer/HoodieDeltaStreamer.java#L132). \r\nWithin readFromSource in DeltaSync(), if checkpoint is fetched from commit metadata, we may not honor this checkpoint type. or we will clear the checkpoint type property if set. \r\nbut if fetched from cfg.checkPoint, we will leave the property as is and let kafkaOffsetGen handle checkpoint parsing. \r\n\r\nBut let me think through this more. But in the mean time, if you can confirm my understanding of the usage of timestamp based checkpointing, would be great. \r\n\r\nCC @n3nash @bvaradar \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/853866564/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/853873382","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/3031#issuecomment-853873382","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3031","id":853873382,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg1Mzg3MzM4Mg==","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-03T13:34:26Z","updated_at":"2021-06-03T13:54:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/hudi/pull/3031?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) Report\n> Merging [#3031](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/hudi/pull/3031?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (07d8c6f) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/hudi/commit/86007e9a13341e1181f940c5f6e5f6dba8eed755?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (86007e9) will **increase** coverage by `0.01%`.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/hudi/pull/3031/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&height=150&src=pr&token=VTTXabwbs2&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/hudi/pull/3031?src=pr&el=tree&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation)\n\n```diff\n@@             Coverage Diff              @@\n##             master    #3031      +/-   ##\n============================================\n+ Coverage     55.13%   55.14%   +0.01%     \n- Complexity     3864     3865       +1     \n============================================\n  Files           487      487              \n  Lines         23608    23608              \n  Branches       2527     2527              \n============================================\n+ Hits          13016    13019       +3     \n+ Misses         9435     9434       -1     \n+ Partials       1157     1155       -2     \n```\n\n| Flag | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| hudicli | `39.55% <ø> (ø)` | |\n| hudiclient | `∅ <ø> (∅)` | |\n| hudicommon | `50.33% <ø> (+0.01%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| hudiflink | `63.34% <ø> (ø)` | |\n| hudihadoopmr | `51.54% <ø> (ø)` | |\n| hudisparkdatasource | `74.28% <ø> (ø)` | |\n| hudisync | `46.44% <ø> (ø)` | |\n| huditimelineservice | `64.36% <ø> (ø)` | |\n| hudiutilities | `70.88% <ø> (+0.04%)` | :arrow_up: |\n\nFlags with carried forward coverage won't be shown.
