If replicas are out of sync then that could cause three issues:\n- Query result inconsistency in real-time, although this one is probably not too bad, as it would happen even without rejection. (Just due to different tasks being at different points in the stream)\n- Query result inconsistency on historicals, due to segments in the same interval being out of sync. If an interval has more than maxRowsPerSegment rows, it will make more than one segment. It's possible that historicals will load a mix of segments from different kafka tasks. If they do this then due to the desync, things won't be lined up right.\n- Potential task failure due to segment allocation sequences being out of sync. This can happen if one task allocates a segment for an old event but another task drops the event. In this case whichever task loses the race will fail its next allocation, if any, and then exit and be replaced.\n\nThese issues might not happen in a real deployment, and might be okay for the short term, but are something to be aware of…\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/222008437/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/222011366","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/3029#issuecomment-222011366","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3029","id":222011366,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMjAxMTM2Ng==","user":{"login":"himanshug","id":246308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjMwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug","html_url":"https://github.com/himanshug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-26T22:18:36Z","updated_at":"2016-05-26T22:18:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@gianm

New supervisors would have to read this value from any currently running tasks when the supervisor starts up and initialize the taskGroup with it. If it finds a task with one minimumMessageTime and then discovers another one with the same partitions/starting offsets with a different one, that should be an illegal state and it should kill one of them.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/222213874/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/222214106","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/3029#issuecomment-222214106","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3029","id":222214106,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMjIxNDEwNg==","user":{"login":"dclim","id":11050882,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDUwODgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11050882?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim","html_url":"https://github.com/dclim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-27T18:02:18Z","updated_at":"2016-05-27T18:02:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@himanshug

1: \"walk through the sequence, gather the keys, do a bulk lookup in order to build a lookup map locally, then build a new sequence out of the old sequence using the lookup map\" will require either materializing the sequence or computing it twice (two sets of queries to data nodes). Materializing will negate the broker's ability to stream back results so I think we should avoid that. Better approach might be to materialize the sequence in batches (like 1000 or 10000 rows at a time) and then do bulk lookups for keys in each batch.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/222216754/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/222218626","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/3029#issuecomment-222218626","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3029","id":222218626,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMjIxODYyNg==","user":{"login":"dclim","id":11050882,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDUwODgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11050882?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim","html_url":"https://github.com/dclim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-27T18:21:27Z","updated_at":"2016-05-27T18:21:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@gianm hm, it could be, or it could be omitted and handled separately if that's easier; I believe the supervisor currently uses part of the sequence name to determine task 'equality' - i.e. rather than comparing all the properties in the Kafka index task spec, it just uses the hash of the spec that's calculated for the sequence name.. so having this hash include minimumMessageTime might complicate things when a new supervisor starts up and checks to see if there are any tasks it should care about..

minimize some the GC overhead you might benefit from an off-heap cache. That's because you are always serializing/deserializing anyways. Most off-heap caches are pretty slow by having coarse locks, but you might be able to layer it with Caffeine to reduce the penalty. The on-heap (Caffeine) cache would be moderately sized and the off-heap would be inclusive (to avoid response time skews caused by evictions). That might give you the regular performance of Caffeine, with the GC friendliness of [OHC](https://github.com/snazy/ohc). [Apache Mnemonic](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mnemonic) would let Caffeine cheaply become off-heap, but I think its too immature.\n\nIt would be nice if you have a way to avoid the byte[] churn, such as using a threadlocal buffer.
