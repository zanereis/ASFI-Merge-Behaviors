Implementation looks sane. Two thoughts:\r\n> \r\n>     1. (Out of scope for this changeset): Maven hints are missing \"Show as warning on current line\". With more hints the noise goes up and the hepfulness goes down. This is a candiate for to much noise. @work this would flag nearly all dependencies and thus I would deactivate it.\r\n\r\nyeah would be nice to have feature parity with the java hints where it makes sense. There is also currently no way to run maven hints as inspections although this is probably only rarely needed. Projects can define project specific hints but this is also only possible for java hints I believe (I don't see anything else in the combo box).\r\n\r\n> \r\n>     2. Would it make sense to provide an update to latest and \"latest in same major version\"? I associate bumping major version with incompatible change or at least \"no stability guarentee\".\r\n\r\nDone. I added it as option in the hint settings. I actually thought about adding this too but dismissed it since I initially wanted to keep this really simple (since there are maven plugins and dependabot for this). But I believe a simple \"don't suggest major version upgrades\" probably covers 95% of all typical cases, so why not.\r\n\r\nThe initial motivation for this was because many project pom templates are outdated, this gives the user a quick upgrade path even on first use once the IDE downloaded the maven index. The release version hint (and other IDE features too) require certain compiler plugin versions. This hint can basically unlock other hints by bumping this version.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1366329439/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1366566344","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/5134#issuecomment-1366566344","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5134","id":1366566344,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5RdCXI","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-28T11:03:01Z","updated_at":"2022-12-28T11:03:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ok

It happened before that it broke master which isn't a huge problem since it can be fixed again but it still is annoying so we try to avoid it if possible.\r\n\r\nThe problem here is that travis is now gone but was still there when this PR ran, so to run the tests again someone would have to push into this PR and rebase.

I have been playing with that for couple of days now and learned how to grab the edges and resize it almost every time with no effort, but I have to admit that it is very clunky. My other idea is to have a little 'resize widget' in the corner of the popup (like the one here on github in which I am writing this comment). \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1368400569/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1368483405","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/5169#issuecomment-1368483405","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5169","id":1368483405,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5RkWZN","user":{"login":"ebresie","id":370894,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDg5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/370894?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebresie","html_url":"https://github.com/ebresie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebresie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebresie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebresie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebresie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebresie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebresie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebresie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebresie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebresie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-01T16:43:04Z","updated_at":"2023-01-01T16:43:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Can any example of the problem be provided?

This is very good @jlahoda. However I checked `java.source.base` module and noticed, that only a subset of problems is gone. The module uses classes from the `com.sun.tools.javac.tree` package, which is in `nb-javac-jdk-19+33.jar`. I tested with this change and all problems are gone:\r\n> \r\n> ```diff\r\n> --- a/apisupport/apisupport.ant/src/org/netbeans/modules/apisupport/project/Evaluator.java\r\n> +++ b/apisupport/apisupport.ant/src/org/netbeans/modules/apisupport/project/Evaluator.java\r\n> @@ -426,15 +426,9 @@\r\n>              if (type == NbModuleType.NETBEANS_ORG && \"true\".equals(projectProperties.getProperties().get(\"requires.nb.javac\"))) {\r\n>                  ModuleEntry javacLibrary = ml.getEntry(\"org.netbeans.libs.javacapi\");\r\n>                  if (javacLibrary != null) {\r\n> -                    List<String> bootstrapAPIs = new ArrayList<>();\r\n> -                    for (String ext : javacLibrary.getClassPathExtensions().split(Pattern.quote(File.pathSeparator))) {\r\n> -                        if (ext.endsWith(\"-api.jar\")) {\r\n> -                            bootstrapAPIs.add(ext);\r\n> +                    buildDefaults.put(ClassPathProviderImpl.BOOTCLASSPATH_PREPEND, javacLibrary.getClassPathExtensions());\r\n>                          }\r\n>                      }\r\n> -                    buildDefaults.put(ClassPathProviderImpl.BOOTCLASSPATH_PREPEND, bootstrapAPIs.stream().collect(Collectors.joining(File.pathSeparator)));\r\n> -                }\r\n> -            }\r\n>              \r\n>              baseEval = PropertyUtils.sequentialPropertyEvaluator(predefs, providers.toArray(new PropertyProvider[providers.size()]));\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nThat's what I don't want to do blindly - that would mean that any module could seemingly use javac internals, which does not sound right. (There are many limitations on this, so some modules have an impl. dependency even though they should not, the impl might be partially visible in the editor anyway, and the build also uses everything including the impl. OTOH, runtime is strict, and I don't think we should make the situation worse.) But, we may be able to parse the javac dependency, and if it is an impl. dependency, use even the implementation. (Of course, the very correct way would be to only use exported packages, but we don't do that in the IDE for anything.)
