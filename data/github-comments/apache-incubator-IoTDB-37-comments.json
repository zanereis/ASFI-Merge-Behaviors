Hi, thanks so much for your contribution!\r\n> \r\n> I find out there are some lines about `SetEnvironmentVariable` in Windows CI workflow. Is it the reason why the Windows tests failed?\r\n> \r\n> https://github.com/apache/iotdb/blob/fe983ed81b97aa8b232bbdde57df08f5e9c32b0d/.github/workflows/main-win.yml#L85-L88\r\n\r\nI'm not familiar with CI workflows, but it seems these lines are working with the Hadoop environment and I prefer that these have nothing to do with my modifications. All I've done is within the cope of iotdb-env.bat, which means even if the SETLOCAL clause is deleted, all variables are only valid in the lifecycle of the single command line. \r\nBy the way, although iotdb-env.bat may modify environment variables within the command line, thus causing errors when some variables with the same names are vital for other commands or scripts, it's mostly called by start-server.bat and the latter has a SETLOCAL clause before calling it and this will strict all variables to be valid within the start-server.bat.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/858366457/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/858379492","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iotdb/pull/3384#issuecomment-858379492","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/3384","id":858379492,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg1ODM3OTQ5Mg==","user":{"login":"sonarqubecloud[bot]","id":39514782,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mzk1MTQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/12526?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/sonarqubecloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-10T07:21:14Z","updated_at":"2021-06-10T07:21:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"SonarCloud
