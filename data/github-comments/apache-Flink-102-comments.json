Translators are just a set of `MapFunction`s applied on vertex or edge ids and values. I think that the current API is way too complex for what it does, e.g.\n`graph.run(new TranslateEdgeValues<LongValue,LongValue,LongValue,StringValue>(new LongValueToStringValue()))` seems too verbose to me for mapping an edge value.\nIt could be as simple as `graph.mapEdges(new LongValueToStringValue())`.\n\nAlso, I don't think we need 6 methods. We could either add 4 methods to `Graph`, i.e. `mapVertexIDs`, `mapVertexValues`, `mapEdgeIds`, `mapEdgeValues` or extend the `mapEdges` and `mapVertices` methods. In the latter case, we will have to provide specialized mappers as you note above, e.g. `MapVertexValueLongToString`, `MapEdgeValueLongToString`, etc., but these can internally wrap the same mapper.\n\nPlease let me know your thought on this!

I'll be removing the two steps which are concerned with degree skew since I had not previously looked at the degree distribution but I haven't found a graph that exhibits degree skew under the algorithm's optimization to generate triplets from the vertex with smallest degree. Would be nice to have a proof, though.\n\nI expect most of the performance difference to be in `DegreeCounter` and `TriadBuilder` caching objects but not supporting object reuse. Using immutable boxed primitives has the same effect as disabling object reuse since deserialization must create a fresh object each time.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/215503980/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/215506281","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1671#issuecomment-215506281","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1671","id":215506281,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNTUwNjI4MQ==","user":{"login":"vasia","id":498957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5ODk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/498957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia","html_url":"https://github.com/vasia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-28T17:41:30Z","updated_at":"2016-04-28T17:41:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I see.

Is it possible to remove it?\n- Could you add support of `Table.orderBy()` to the table. We forgot to update the docs when the feature was added.\n- I think we should add a note to the SQL section that it is not feature complete and only supports what the Table API supports. Hence it does not support: Outer joins, distinct aggregates, date and decimal data types, and more .\n\nI have a few more suggestions:\n- Overall, the documentation is quite focused on the Table API and how it integrates with the DataSet and DataStream API. I think it would be good to describe it as an independent API for relational stream _and_ batch processing with a good integration into the DataSet and DataStream API. Table API and SQL should be described as equivalent APIs.\n- We could move the section about table registration out of the Table API section. It is also valid for SQL and could go into the \"Using the Table API and SQL\" section (or become a top-level section itself). We could also describe the registration as the default way to create tables and the describe the `DataSet`/`DataStream` -> `Table` conversions of the Table API as shortcuts.

I only took a quick look, but I will go through the changes in detail soon.\nOne thing I noticed is that you use static variables for performing the normalization. This won't work in a distributed environment. You will need to use aggregators instead. Take a look at `IterationConfiguration.registerAggregator`. `VertexUpdateFunction` and `MessagingFunction` have methods to retrieve an aggregator and an aggregated value from the previous superstep. Let me know if you need help :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/216222300/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/216223474","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1952#issuecomment-216223474","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1952","id":216223474,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNjIyMzQ3NA==","user":{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-02T12:31:44Z","updated_at":"2016-05-02T12:31:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@cowtowncoder
