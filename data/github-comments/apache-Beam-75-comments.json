I wasn't able to even figure out which of these events happens first, too much asynchronous stuff going on. And it happens in different ways (getting different exceptions). But it happens reliably.\r\n\r\nSome instructions for reproducing:\r\n- In MqttIOTest, wrap the body of testWrite() into `for (int j = 0; j < 1000; j++)` to get faster test iterations without restarting the whole broker\r\n- To add more logging, do this at the beginning of the test:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    java.util.logging.Logger logger = java.util.logging.Logger.getLogger(\"org.eclipse.paho.client.mqttv3\");\r\n// Also tried:\r\n//    java.util.logging.Logger logger = java.util.logging.Logger.getLogger(\"org.apache.activemq.transport\");\r\n    ConsoleHandler handler = new ConsoleHandler();\r\n    handler.setLevel(Level.FINE);\r\n    logger.addHandler(handler);\r\n    logger.setLevel(Level.ALL);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't know what's going on, but the PR can't go in until this is resolved - at this level of flakiness, it will both destabilize tests and probably just won't work in production either.
