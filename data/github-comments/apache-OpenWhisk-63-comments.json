this is good to have in place some time in the future.\r\n\r\nHere are some thoughts:\r\n- End user of homebrew should NOT need to compile the `wsk` CLI on their computer\r\n- We should move the CLI to it's own Repository\r\n- We should configure a jenkins server in Apache Infra or OpenWhisk server with alarm tirgger to do nightly/commit releases\r\n  - Create git Tag/Release with something like 1.0.0-dev_$timestamp\r\n  - Compile `wsk` and attached to github release page or add link and host binary some where\r\n- To cut release version, we need to go thru Apache process, cut the version `1.0.0`, vote, create source zip for source release, publish binary and create tag/release github page.\r\n- nightly are easy and schedule and always gives you latest and fresh copy\r\n- voted release take some more effort so they will be release in cadence that allows time for the release cutting process.\r\n- Submit formula to homebrew that relies on the binaries\r\n\r\nLooking forward for someone to work on this in some time in the future.\r\n

thousands of lingering connections. Time_wait is unnecessary here because connections are not re-used by Docker and a new one is opened for every `docker run` or other command that talks to the daemon. Also since this is a local connection, there can not be any packets in flight that need to be waited for.\r\n\r\nNot only is it slower than the unix socket connections, but all those `time_wait` connections can bear a significant memory burden on the machine, too.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/281291685/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/281293414","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/1852#issuecomment-281293414","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1852","id":281293414,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MTI5MzQxNA==","user":{"login":"jeremiaswerner","id":17203227,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjAzMjI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17203227?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremiaswerner","html_url":"https://github.com/jeremiaswerner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremiaswerner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremiaswerner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremiaswerner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremiaswerner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremiaswerner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremiaswerner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremiaswerner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremiaswerner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremiaswerner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-21T09:43:12Z","updated_at":"2017-02-21T09:43:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"rebased

add docs/file1.md\r\ngit commit -m \"changes for file1\"\r\ngit push origin new_file1\r\n#go to github to submit PR\r\n```\r\nDo the same for the file2.md\r\ngo back and do `git checkout master` and then create a new branch for file2\r\n take into account that when you do `git status` you will see file1 being untracked or modifed, don't worry just ignore it and just add file2 for PR2 `git add docs/file2.md`\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/281947232/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/281985718","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/1107#issuecomment-281985718","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1107","id":281985718,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MTk4NTcxOA==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-23T13:01:24Z","updated_at":"2017-02-23T13:01:24Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"A
