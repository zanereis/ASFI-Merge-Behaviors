Not even a mention or stack trace in the tserver logs.  I swapped out the WALs with emptys and the issue still persisted.  Eventually ended up removing the `log` metadata entries so the tablets would be assigned.  I'll check the 1.9.3 release notes and changes a bit closer to see if I can blame it on an existing issue.  \r\n\r\nTo answer your question, these tablets do exist and have data, so I doubt it'd be old metadata entries.  I am wondering if the `check` call on `KeyExtent` has a false positive failure scenario in some situation where both `prevEndRow` and `endRow` are empty or there is no data to recover?  Would a `log` entry get added to `accumulo.metadata` for a tablet that has no data?  My limited understanding is that these `log` metadata entries should only get added when data is written to a tablet.  Maybe some kind of race condition?

Although a bit long, the generalized configs were probably better long-run, rather than try to continue to maintain lots of little one-off specialized configs.\r\n\r\nThat said, a lot of people deal with binary data in Accumulo, and seeing data encoded as base16, hexadecimal, base32, or base64, might be really useful as a general rule to have baked in, so I wouldn't be opposed if we provided those basic facilities, and drew the line on anything else.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/487806009/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/487807293","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/1114#issuecomment-487807293","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1114","id":487807293,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NzgwNzI5Mw==","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-30T02:51:53Z","updated_at":"2019-04-30T02:51:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@milleruntime I removed the 2.0.0 label based on your last comment.

I think it may make sense to bump this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/488047585/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/488125467","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/1144#issuecomment-488125467","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1144","id":488125467,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4ODEyNTQ2Nw==","user":{"login":"milleruntime","id":11872539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODcyNTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11872539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime","html_url":"https://github.com/milleruntime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-30T21:41:15Z","updated_at":"2019-04-30T21:41:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Some more info:\r\nInstalling Apache Hadoop 3.2.0 at /local/uno/install/hadoop-3.2.0\r\nInstalling Apache ZooKeeper 3.4.13 at /local/uno/install/zookeeper-3.4.13\r\nInstalling Apache Accumulo 2.0.0-SNAPSHOT at /local/uno/install/accumulo-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/488125467/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/488144810","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1138#issuecomment-488144810","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1138","id":488144810,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4ODE0NDgxMA==","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-30T22:57:20Z","updated_at":"2019-04-30T22:57:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I'm not opposed to the change.

This specific change feels a bit lateral to me, and not obviously better than what exists now.\r\n\r\nAlso, none of the current behavior or suggested changes really fix the underlying problem. All of this only exists (and we maintain it) because people want to scan from something like a command-line, and manipulate the output without writing code. Back in 2013, [I suggested](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ACCUMULO-1045) what I think is the best solution for this: separate utilities to replace the shell, so that output can be directly piped to whatever tools users want to use to manipulate their scan output for analysis and/or presentation.\r\n\r\nI'd rather we had a scan utility that was independent of \"shell\" than try to provide an API within the shell for doing stuff in code a user can already do with existing utilities available in their terminal. With the client properties improvements, perhaps it's worth revisiting that now, and deprecating all the scan commands, rather than just specific presentation options? With a stable client API in Accumulo, we don't even have to release this separate utility as often as we release Accumulo. It would just use our public API to read a client config file, create a client, scan, and exit.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/488144810/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/488148403","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/1110#issuecomment-488148403","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1110","id":488148403,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4ODE0ODQwMw==","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-30T23:14:41Z","updated_at":"2019-04-30T23:14:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I didn't try a build to see the warning.

I am thinking ServerContext would provide an instance of this interface.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n/**\r\n * An abstraction layer for mutating Accumulo's persistent metadata.

tablet(KeyExtent extent);\r\n    GcMutator deletesFor(TableId tableId);\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  /**\r\n   * Interface for changing a tablets persistent data.\r\n   */\r\n  public interface TabletMutator {\r\n    public TabletMutator setPrevEndRow(Text per);\r\n    public TabletMutator addFile(String path, DataFileValue dfv);\r\n    public TabletMutator addFiles(Map<String, DataFileValue> files);\r\n

public void remove(String path);\r\n    public void remove(Collection<String> paths);\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  Selector mutating();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing this interface I rewrote

used to update a tablets files after a major compaction.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  public static void replaceDatafiles(ServerContext context, KeyExtent extent,\r\n      Set<FileRef> datafilesToDelete, Set<FileRef> scanFiles, FileRef path, Long compactionId,\r\n      DataFileValue size, String address, TServerInstance lastLocation, ZooLock zooLock,\r\n      boolean insertDeleteFlags) {\r\n\r\n
