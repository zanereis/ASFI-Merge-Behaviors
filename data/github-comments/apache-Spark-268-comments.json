It's great to see us adding more automated code quality checks. Couple things:\n1. Could you add `[PySpark]` to the title of this PR? We are using tags like that to do sorting amongst the committership and it will get noticed that way.\n2. In terms of the dependency on pep8, we've tried really hard to avoid having exogenous dependencies in Spark. It makes porting things like our QA environment very difficult. So one idea - could this have a script that just lazily fetches the pep8 library directly? For instance, this is what we do with our sbt tool - we just wget the sbt jar... it seems like you could do something similar for pep8. Not sure if that totally works, but just an idea.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50982162/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50982167","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1748#issuecomment-50982167","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1748","id":50982167,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwOTgyMTY3","user":{"login":"pwendell","id":320616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDYxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/320616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell","html_url":"https://github.com/pwendell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-03T04:55:44Z","updated_at":"2014-08-03T04:55:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks Sean -

And `--` was chosen because it's an idiomatic way among UNIX-like systems to pass this kind of \"user application options\".\n\nThe reason that we (@pwendell and me) gave it up after discussion is that this solution is actually not fully downward compatible, it breaks existing user applications which already recognize `--` as a valid option. Turning `--` into something more specific like `--spark-application-args` does reduce the probability of name collision. Especially, after this change, we won't have similar compatibility issue whenever we add any new options to `spark-submit` in the future. @pwendell Maybe this is acceptable?\n\nAnd I agree with your arguments about the drawbacks of putting application jar into `--jars`. Similar arguments applies to Python application.
