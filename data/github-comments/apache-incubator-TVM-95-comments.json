Once we have something that is concretely actionable, we can bring it to issues and fix the problem promptly","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/485045295/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/485045502","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3046#issuecomment-485045502","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3046","id":485045502,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NTA0NTUwMg==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-20T00:50:50Z","updated_at":"2019-04-20T00:50:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks @ajtulloch @hlu1 , this is now merged!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/485045502/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/485045780","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/3023#issuecomment-485045780","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3023","id":485045780,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NTA0NTc4MA==","user":{"login":"cbalint13","id":3974360,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzQzNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3974360?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13","html_url":"https://github.com/cbalint13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-20T00:54:04Z","updated_at":"2019-04-20T00:54:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/opencl-mali-error-use-of-undeclared-identifier-inff/2270","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/485045780/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/485045857","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3049#issuecomment-485045857","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3049","id":485045857,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NTA0NTg1Nw==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-20T00:54:50Z","updated_at":"2019-04-20T00:54:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I hope we can use something that is more principled.

for taking a look at this! And btw huge fan of all your other work :D \r\n\r\nI would love to have DLPack support directly in TF and agree that would make this ask easier. \r\n\r\nHowever I'd like to point out an alternative path that has some advantages from a project management / open source collaboration POV. \r\n\r\nGetting DLPack support merged into TF is likely 10x more work than support level 1 described above. And in fact, just getting some minimal example working would be a useful step towards the more general solution, both in making issues more explicit, but also in terms of providing raw material for those who may be more expert in TF to pick up and polish further. \r\n\r\nSo DLPack-in-TF is not strictly a hard requirement, and it might be useful to try to do this the other way around. \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/485148338/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/485152027","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/3059#issuecomment-485152027","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3059","id":485152027,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NTE1MjAyNw==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-20T19:08:30Z","updated_at":"2019-04-20T19:08:30Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"OK, I agree.

TVM related support should be placed as a standalone github repository to ensure the loose coupling between TF and TVM;\r\n2. The concrete method to achieve this loose coupling is to leverage TF's graph optimization registration mechanism, which will be invoked at TF runtime.\r\n3. A new graph pass can be added based on TF graph optimization framework(just the same as TF XLA's MarkForCompilation, EncapsulateSubGraph, BuildXLALaunchOp) which can recognize some portions of the TF graph which we think might benefit from TVM backend and then cluster these TF operations into a TF2TVMCompilation(or some other name) sub-graph and finally replace those clustered ops with a TF2TVMBridgeOp macro op.\r\n4. During the initial run of TF2TVMBridgeOp, compile the underlying TF ops into backend executables through TVM infrastructure, to ensure the smoothness of compilation phase, an extra IR  layer may be necessary in addition to TVM's own IR architecture, this should be open for design discussion.\r\n5. After the initial run of TF2TVMBridgeOp, for the following runs, the compiled executable can be directly invoked. Another round of compilation may be necessary when the input data shape of the TF2TVMBridgeOp changes(although TVM provides native support for dynamic shape, we may wish to tease performance boundary through static shape information)\r\n6. The initial scenario I personally think TVM can complement TF and XLA is its native supporting mechanism for compute-intensive operations, such as GEMM/Conv, which might be a good starting point. For non-compute-intensive operations(such as add/mul/reduce/transpose, etc.), I think XLA currently already provides good mechanism support, and we could follow XLA's infrastructure to optimize these non-compute-intensive operations directly.\r\n\r\nThere are some scenarios we estimated to be suitable for this feature and already started the design and refine work. If you have any interests, it would be highly appreciated to provide your concrete use case or jump into the design&discussion directly. \r\n\r\nThanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/485226269/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/485230004","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2834#issuecomment-485230004","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2834","id":485230004,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NTIzMDAwNA==","user":{"login":"kazum","id":812126,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMjEyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/812126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum","html_url":"https://github.com/kazum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-21T06:59:33Z","updated_at":"2019-04-21T06:59:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @yongwww @srkreddy1238.

As Relay is also planning to support dynamic shape(https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/issues/3042), we might not need to directly handle step 5(relay does the JIT/bucketing under the hood). We are also thinking that is it reasonable to do the opposite, the main runtime is tvm runtime, and fallback to TensorFlow for unsupported ops, would it yield a solution that has lower memory footprint?
