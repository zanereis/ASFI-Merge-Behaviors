Thanks for the very detailed explanation.\r\n\r\nThe components are designed to be decoupled and don't know the exists of each other. We are planning to add a separate layout module to adjust all the components' position and size to avoid the overlap. It needs the default value of `left/top/right/bottom` to be changed and may cause breaking change. So we put it in the 5.0 roadmap.\r\n\r\nCurrently, I'm afraid the easiest way is still letting developers configure `grid.top` to 0 if there is only one grid component on the chart :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/533946781/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/533946785","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/11091#issuecomment-533946785","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/11091","id":533946785,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMzk0Njc4NQ==","user":{"login":"echarts-bot[bot]","id":45089189,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDUwODkxODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/20872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/echarts-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-23T02:59:58Z","updated_at":"2019-09-23T02:59:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue is closed due to not being active.

The problem seems to be in the `turnPointsIntoStep` func in [LineView.js](https://github.com/apache/incubator-echarts/blob/fd064123626c97b36cbd6da1b5fc73385c280abd/src/chart/line/LineView.js#L189)\r\n\r\nThe function automatically grabs the next point without checking if any of the point coordinates are NaN - which ends up with a bad point array.\r\n\r\nThe way I see it this can be fixed in two ways - \r\n1. We can sanitize the points array at the beginning of the function by filtering all NaN values. \r\nSomething like this would do it:\r\n`points = points.filter((el) => !isNaN(el[0]) && !isNaN(el[1]));` \r\n\r\n2. In the actual for-loop we can skip over NaN elements until we get the next well-defined point. \r\n```\r\n for (var i = 0; i < points.length - 1; i++) {\r\n        var pt = points[i];\r\n        // Skip over undefined points.\r\n        while (isNaN(points[i + 1][0]) || isNaN(points[i + 1][1])) {\r\n            i++;\r\n        }\r\n        var nextPt = points[i + 1];\r\n\r\n```\r\nRunning a dev build locally - and testing with the reproduction code I posted above seems to result in a nice step line. \r\n\r\nLet me know which way you think is more suitable or if there's something I'm missing. \r\nI'm happy to raise a PR and add tests if necessary.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/534033427/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/534058871","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/10824#issuecomment-534058871","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/10824","id":534058871,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNDA1ODg3MQ==","user":{"login":"chengwb53","id":18694507,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4Njk0NTA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18694507?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengwb53","html_url":"https://github.com/chengwb53","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengwb53/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengwb53/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengwb53/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengwb53/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengwb53/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengwb53/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengwb53/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengwb53/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengwb53/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-23T11:26:38Z","updated_at":"2019-09-23T11:26:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> 你的代码有问题，`label` 和 `itemStyle` 应该是同级的。\r\n> 不过好像 `position` 的确没用生效。\r\n\r\n3.4.0版本不是同级","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/534058871/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/534065357","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/10806#issuecomment-534065357","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/10806","id":534065357,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNDA2NTM1Nw==","user":{"login":"Holoskevych","id":31503217,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTAzMjE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31503217?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Holoskevych","html_url":"https://github.com/Holoskevych","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Holoskevych/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Holoskevych/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Holoskevych/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Holoskevych/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Holoskevych/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Holoskevych/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Holoskevych/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Holoskevych/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Holoskevych/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-23T11:50:12Z","updated_at":"2019-09-23T11:50:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi\r\n\r\n> Sorry, This feature will be released in version 4.4.0.

You may also send an email about your question to dev@echarts.apache.org if you like.\r\n \r\nHere's why:\r\n \r\nMaintaining open source projects, especially popular ones, is hard work. As ECharts's user base has grown, we are getting more and more usage questions, bug reports, feature requests and pull requests every single day.\r\n \r\nAs a free and open source project, ECharts also has limited maintainer bandwidth. That means the only way to ensure the project's sustainability is to:\r\n  \r\nPrioritize more concrete work (bug fixes and new features);\r\n \r\nImprove issue triaging efficiency.\r\n  \r\nFor (1), we have decided to use the GitHub issue lists exclusively for work that has well-defined, actionable goals. Questions and open ended discussions should be posted to mediums that are better suited for them.\r\n \r\nFor (2), we have found that issues that do not provide proper information upfront usually results in terribly inefficient back-and-forth communication just to extract the basic information needed for actual triaging. This is exactly why we have created this app: to ensure that every issue is created with the necessary information, and to save time on both sides.\r\n \r\n—\r\nYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.\r\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or mute the thread.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/534421581/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/534429316","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/11307#issuecomment-534429316","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/11307","id":534429316,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNDQyOTMxNg==","user":{"login":"echarts-bot[bot]","id":45089189,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDUwODkxODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/20872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/echarts-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-24T07:28:28Z","updated_at":"2019-09-24T07:28:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi!

@zifix, really appreciate your passion!\r\n\r\nIn ECharts, axis type like `'log'` is abstracted as [Scale](https://github.com/apache/incubator-echarts/blob/master/src/scale/Scale.js). There are different kinds of scales:\r\n\r\n+ Ordinal\r\n+ Interval\r\n+ Log\r\n+ Time\r\n\r\nOrdinal scale and interval scale are the most commonly used. Ordinal is for category data, while the interval is for the `number` like data. \r\n\r\nWe fixed the scale to be `interval` in the radar chart. https://github.com/apache/incubator-echarts/blob/master/src/coord/radar/Radar.js#L43 But as you mentioned. It's better to support `log` scale.\r\n\r\nAbout how to create the `scale` from the given option. https://github.com/apache/incubator-echarts/blob/master/src/coord/axisHelper.js#L248 may be an example you can reference.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if you have any more questions.
