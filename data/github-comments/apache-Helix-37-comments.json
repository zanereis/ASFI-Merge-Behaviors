The rational behind reducing this default timeout is that 25 days is way too much timeout for any operation to retry IMHO. Even 1 day is long one but still it is reasonable in some sense, in reality I'm hoping that end users will override this by few mins timeout value. Let me know if that makes sense.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/1331973904/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/1332558081","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/helix/pull/2293#issuecomment-1332558081","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2293","id":1332558081,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAPIHxc5PbTkB","user":{"login":"jiajunwang","id":1803880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDM4ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1803880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang","html_url":"https://github.com/jiajunwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-30T18:16:23Z","updated_at":"2022-11-30T18:16:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I don't have any concern regarding the change.
