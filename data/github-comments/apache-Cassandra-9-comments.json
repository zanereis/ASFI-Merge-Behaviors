Sorry, this is the last round I'm sure...\r\n\r\nNo worries! More rounds we have better the results are :+1: \r\n\r\n> When actually running C* itself, either from the source tree or the binary distro, Hadoop and its deps aren't on the classpath so we get a NoClassDefFoundError when deleting from the vtables.\r\n\r\nOh.. it is a pity that the build does not guarantee correctness of the code.. I think once we migrate from `ant`, it is worth to consider moving Hadoop stuff to a separate module. Anyway, it is too early to think about it. Great catch! Done.\r\n\r\n> One other related thing I noticed while testing this is that nodetool invalidatepermissionscache <role> has no effect.\r\n\r\nOh! I fixed it and added a corresponding test. Thanks for spotting the issue!\r\n\r\n\r\nPS: I triggered a new CI build for the latest changes: https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/view/patches/job/Cassandra-devbranch/1223/ \r\n**UPDATE:** CI looks

@azotcsit and @sumanth-pasupuleti, I spoke to @clohfink yesterday a bit and from a workflow perspective, if we could have the JMX call to denylist a key be a \"hit it once and it adds and refreshes\" that'd be ideal (reasonably so). We had that in an interim commit but removed it due to trying to keep the cache consistent which we later backed off on, so there's no reason we can't, and shouldn't, add that back in.\r\n\r\nFirst commit is adding that functionality back in and adjusting tests to deal with it, second is updating the documentation to reflect workflow for CQL (bulk) or JMX (single).\r\n\r\nThe last outstanding thing I can't think of a good solution to is what to do if a node is gc thrashing, read and write CQL stages are a mess, and denylisting requires CQL mutation to work. While we *could* append a new deny listed key to the DenylistEntry's in the cache independently of, or before, the CQL mutation that adds it to the dedicated store for the denylist, that means we'll likely have a disjoint between what's deny listed in our cache vs. what's in CQL and makes the in-memory cache the authority vs. what's in the DB. I'm actually somewhat receptive to that, since the JMX call queries what's in the cache and actively denylisting, but I think we should probably leave that up to a follow-up ticket rather than trying to tackle that on the tail end of this... marathon. 😀 \r\n\r\nIf you two are good with these last two commits, I think we're good to run the full suite of tests and merge this thing. @azotcsit to your earlier point about having another committer's eyes on, as this is an upstream of something that was reviewed by a couple committers already and you and Sumanth are both committers, AND this is disabled by default, I'm pretty comfortable with us merging if we're all good after these couple of commits and a test run.\r\n\r\nThanks everyone for all the effort on this thing; it's been quite a haul polishing things up.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/comments/953089175/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/comments/953164260","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/1291#issuecomment-953164260","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/1291","id":953164260,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmWM440CHk","user":{"login":"dcapwell","id":1852601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTI2MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1852601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcapwell","html_url":"https://github.com/dcapwell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcapwell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcapwell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcapwell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcapwell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcapwell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcapwell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcapwell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcapwell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcapwell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-27T17:44:26Z","updated_at":"2021-10-27T17:44:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Spoke with @belliottsmith in slack, decided to rename andThenAsync to flatMap.

An operator would run the JMX command on a single node and, if they needed _immediate_ action across the cluster, run the loadPartitionDenylist call across all nodes so they'd pick it up. Otherwise they'd hit the one on a particular node that was underwater, let it recover, and let the rest of the cluster pick it up in the refresh period.\r\n\r\nIt's functionally no different than the previous paradigm, where an operator would be expected to:\r\n\r\n1. Insert the record on a node\r\n2. Call loadPartitionDenylist on that node\r\n3. Call loadPartitionDenylist on other nodes in the cluster if more than 1 is behind because of a problematic partition\r\n\r\nJust cuts out one step.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/comments/953855890/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/comments/954125099","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/1213#issuecomment-954125099","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/1213","id":954125099,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmWM443ssr","user":{"login":"azotcsit","id":20664654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjY0NjU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20664654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/azotcsit","html_url":"https://github.com/azotcsit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azotcsit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azotcsit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azotcsit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azotcsit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azotcsit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azotcsit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azotcsit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azotcsit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azotcsit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-28T19:10:51Z","updated_at":"2021-10-28T19:10:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"My understanding was that operators anyway use some automation tools that allow them to run a command (refresh in our case) on all nodes.
