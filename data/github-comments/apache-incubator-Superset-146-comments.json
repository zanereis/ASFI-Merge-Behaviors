It's rough on Presto/Hive for instance and in many cases is a similar internal cost as running the whole thing from the db's perspective. Then there's the wrap-in-a-subquery approach, that's better and prefer that to `fetchmany`, though I think many db optimizer won't do as good with that as with the `LIMIT` in the main core query. It requires more complex query editing but is preferable to the subquery approach as it may result in a simpler query plan.\r\n\r\nI also looked at how other tools seem to be doing this, and they edit the user query much like we do here, likely for the reasons listed above.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/392997951/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/393010034","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/5101#issuecomment-393010034","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/5101","id":393010034,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MzAxMDAzNA==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-30T02:27:02Z","updated_at":"2018-07-09T23:15:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#
