我明白tag用来标明一类消息更合适，但是我们是想标明更细化标签，用来做消息过滤和分发，其中会包含部分业务功能信息；官网文档我也查看过了，sql92实现复杂过滤，但是暂时还不能支持contain包含的处理，只能是通过不同的key设置对应值来过滤。如果没有最理想的方式我们只能是通过属性key来区分过滤。\r\n> \r\n> SQL92 支持 LIKE 操作符，可以用类似 `operation LIKE '%op1%'` 的语法来满足你的需求\r\n\r\n确定sql92支持like？经过测试，并不支持，官方文档里也没有写支持like","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/2188212973/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/2188733530","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/8327#issuecomment-2188733530","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/8327","id":2188733530,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl86CdWxa","user":{"login":"tongtaodragon","id":34854981,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0ODU0OTgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34854981?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tongtaodragon","html_url":"https://github.com/tongtaodragon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tongtaodragon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tongtaodragon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tongtaodragon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tongtaodragon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tongtaodragon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tongtaodragon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tongtaodragon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tongtaodragon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tongtaodragon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-25T11:50:43Z","updated_at":"2024-06-25T11:50:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The

I use the Rust client. First I thought it was a client bug. But later I use grpcurl to send the same messages and I got the same result. The Rust client surpport batch send. I only found this problem in batch send api. When use batch send. not only the order is wrong, also the keys are wrong, all the messages in the same batch will have the key of the first message of the batch. and in the batch send scenario, the message are put in different queue randomly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/2195974652/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/2196234477","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/8337#issuecomment-2196234477","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/8337","id":2196234477,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl86C5-Dt","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-28T06:30:43Z","updated_at":"2024-06-28T06:30:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## [Codecov](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/rocketmq/pull/8337?dropdown=coverage&src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=apache) Report\nAttention: Patch coverage is `50.00000%` with `1 line` in your changes missing coverage.
