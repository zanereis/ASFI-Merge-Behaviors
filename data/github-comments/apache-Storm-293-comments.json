Performance hit is not avoidable in this case.\r\n\r\nAs I commented earlier, if we have consensus that the use case is minor (initiating poll to user@/dev@, or any other approaches), we can consider about not supporting thread-safety on output collector for the benefit of major use cases.

There was some initial investigation around this, but its not a trivial task. I will try to revisit and put up a plan and a skeleton in the next few weeks or so and we can build upon that. Meanwhile you can take a look at the beam prototype that was done using the storm core apis here - <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/tree/beam-runner\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/tree/beam-runner</a> The beam apis itself might have changed since but you can use it as a reference.

I was reinforced in that belief by your comments here https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2174#issuecomment-321627375, which indicated that we were discussing either merging this to 1.x and then another solution to master, or providing a different solution for both branches and closing this PR.\r\n\r\nI did speak with you, three weeks ago when we discussed how to fix the Trident spout https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2174#issuecomment-321623377. Your last comment was https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2174#issuecomment-322223764, which I took to mean that you basically agreed that we should make the changes, but that you were considering whether we should keep this PR for 1.x. I had no way to know that you were working on implementing fixes for the 2691/2473 issues as part of 2554. I feel like I communicated pretty clearly that I was beginning work on an implementation, both by notifying you here that I thought we should consider a broad rewrite that would possibly make this PR redundant, and by assigning https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-2691 to myself (this is visible to everyone subscribed to the storm-issues mailing list). I'd be happy to explicitly mention you in an issue comment before I begin work if we get into a situation like this again.\r\n\r\nCould you elaborate on the other instances you're talking about? The only one I can recall is https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2147, and we discussed the alternative fix a bunch on the mailing list before I touched the code, and you gave no indication that you were intending to work on manual partition assignment. \r\n\r\nI'm sorry about the misunderstanding, and I'm happy to close https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2300 if you have a better solution.

href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-2549:\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-2549:</a><br/>\nThe only way to know that a tuple has been deleted from Kafka is to try polling for it. We can know for sure that a failed tuple has been deleted if we seek to the failed tuple's offset (or earlier) on the relevant partition and poll, and we then encounter a tuple that has a higher offset than the failed tuple on that partition earlier in the result set.</p>\n\n<p>For instance:<br/>\nOffset 0...5 have failed and also been compacted away. Offset 6 has failed and is present, offset 7 has failed and is not present.<br/>\nWe seek to offset 0 for the partition.<br/>\nIf we then see that the first message in the poll result is offset 6, we can be sure that offset 0...5 are deleted, because otherwise they would have been returned in the poll. Offset 7 cannot be removed from the spout because we can't be sure that it was deleted, the consumer may just have received too few messages.</p>\n\n<p>I think we can use this method to remove failed, deleted tuples from the offset manager. When we do a poll, we examine the retriable offsets for each partition. For each partition where we received messages, we compare the earliest received message's offset to the retriable offsets for that partition. If a given retriable offset is lower than the offset of the earliest received message, then the retriable offset must have been deleted.

I don't think we need to support auto offset reset policy being none, since that'll just cause an exception and restart the spout:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Auto offset reset is latest\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>0 or more acked offsets when reset, no pending retries when reset happens:<br/>\nExample: 0-3 are acked, 0-1 are deleted. 10 is the latest offset.<br/>\nConsumer will seek to latest offset (10). When new tuples are acked after the reset, the OffsetManager will skip past all the unemitted tuples (4-9). I don't think we need to do anything special for this case.</li>\n\t\t<li>0 or more acked offsets when reset, earliest pending retry is deleted:<br/>\nExample: 0-3 are acked, 0-4 are deleted. 4-5 are retriable and 10 is the latest offset.<br/>\nConsumer will seek to latest offset (10). The spout will handle acks as described in the previous case. When the retriable tuples become ready, the consumer will seek back to the earliest retriable offset (4). Since 4 is deleted, the consumer seeks to latest. Since the spout asked for retriable offset 4 and got 10 as the earliest, it will consider 4-9 deleted and mark them as acked. While offset 5 is technically still possible to retry, I don't think this is necessarily unexpected or bad behavior. I'd be okay with leaving this behavior as is.</li>\n\t\t<li>0 or more acked offsets when reset, earliest pending retry is not deleted:<br/>\nExample: 0-3 are acked, 0-3 are deleted. 4-5 are retriable and 10 is the latest offset.<br/>\nSame as above, except when the retriable tuples become ready, the consumer will seek back to the earliest retriable offset (4). The spout continues processing from offset 4. This is a little inconsistent with the case above, but I don't think it's bad behavior, so I'm okay with leaving it like this.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Auto offset reset is earliest, cleanup policy is delete\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>0 or more acked offsets when reset, no pending retries when reset happens:<br/>\nExactly the same as the case for latest, except the consumer seeks to earliest instead.</li>\n\t\t<li>0 or more acked offsets when reset, earliest pending retry is deleted:<br/>\nBroadly the same as for latest. When the retriable tuples become ready, the consumer will seek back to the earliest retriable offset (4). Since 4 is deleted, the consumer seeks to earliest (5). 5 is skipped initially because it is not ready for retry, and processing picks up at 6. 5 gets retried whenever it becomes ready.</li>\n\t\t<li>0 or more acked offsets when reset, earliest pending retry is not deleted:<br/>\nShould be the same as the case for latest. The consumer will seek to earliest and poll, receiving offset 4-10. Since 4 and 5 are scheduled for retry and not ready, they will be skipped but left in the retry service until they're ready. Processing starts at 6 and works as normal. This seems fine to me.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>For these cases I'd be okay with not doing any more work. The only one that is a little counter intuitive is number 2, but I think when auto offset reset is set to latest, the user should expect that the spout may skip some tuples.</p>\n\n<p>My only worry is what happens if the spout commits offsets that were deleted. The javadoc for KafkaConsumer.commitSync states that it may throw an exception in that case: \"KafkaException - for any other unrecoverable errors (e.g. if offset metadata is too large or if the committed offset is invalid).\". I tested it on an 0.11 broker and consumer and it doesn't appear to actually throw this exception even if the offset doesn't exist, so I've asked about it on the Kafka users list.</p>\n\n<p>What do you think, is this a reasonable way to look at it or do we need to do more?</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2613013964/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2613013980","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/6328#issuecomment-2613013980","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/6328","id":2613013980,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTMwMTM5ODA=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-03T18:03:25Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T17:11:48Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=srdo\">srdo</a>:</i>\n<p>Copy pasting from the Kafka mailing list <a href=\"http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/kafka-users/201709.mbox/%3CCA%2BOCqnYvhDTQ_dWthg68aO0JKgAENuwDyn-LgdnEyg%2BwAAgGMw%40mail.gmail.com%3E:\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/kafka-users/201709.mbox/%3CCA%2BOCqnYvhDTQ_dWthg68aO0JKgAENuwDyn-LgdnEyg%2BwAAgGMw%40mail.gmail.com%3E:</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I believe the Javadoc is slightly incorrect/misleading.<br/>\nWhen it says \"offset metadata is too large\", it is about the metadata<br/>\nyou can commit along with the offset, not the offset.
