If we don't override, we call into fetchLatestBaseFiles(partitionPath) which in turn calls into fetchAllStoredFileGroups(partitionPath). so this is essentially fetching all file groups for the partition of interest and then deducing from it. \r\n\r\nwhere as in our overridden method, we filter directly w/ rocksDB for the partition and fileId of interest and then fetching just the latest

@danny0405 , regarding the two changes:\r\n- embedding schema in payload might hard to do schema evolution later.\r\n- using flink state to store full HoodieRecord instead of location, will increase the state size.\r\n\r\nfor first one, I remove the schema filed from payload class, instead, by passing the schema to `preCombine` method, it should be easy to do schema evolution if need.\r\nfor second one, I revert my changes about store whole HoodieRecord back to store location, it still has the problem that once the record partition path changed, but i think it should enough for supporting the case that the table don't have partition, or the partition path of record won't changed.\r\n\r\nBTW, do you think is it worthy to implement a new bucket assign function(can be controlled by feature toggle/configuration ) which store the full record to support partial update totally

I missed tracking this issue.\r\n\r\nIn its current state, we must [sync Hudi table to Hive metastore](https://hudi.apache.org/docs/syncing_metastore) in order to query through Trino. Our integration with Trino is via the hive connector. And that too, only for reads i.e. we cannot create hudi tables using Trino.\r\n\r\nAfter syncing the Hudi table to Hive metastore and placing the hudi-presto-bundle in the hive plugin path, we can run snapshot queries on COW table and read-optimized queries on MOR table right away. You can look at an example in our [docker demo](https://hudi.apache.org/docs/docker_demo). That said, we are working on a [separate Hudi connector](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/10228) to which we'll add the write support after the base PR is merged.\r\n\r\nI would love to understand your requirements and help you out with the Hive sync and Trino setup to query Hudi tables. You can also help us by checking out the PR linked above and test for your tables. Feel free to directly ping me on Hudi slack or join our weekly [community syncs](https://hudi.apache.org/community/syncs).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1047448948/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1047459666","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/4861#issuecomment-1047459666","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4861","id":1047459666,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM4-bvdS","user":{"login":"danny0405","id":7644508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NDQ1MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7644508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405","html_url":"https://github.com/danny0405","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-22T06:12:53Z","updated_at":"2022-02-22T06:12:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@hudi-bot
