collect all RPC calls, we need a way to control/monitor accesses to the FileSystem object across all classes. At the moment, we use FSUtils.getFs() which returns back the vanilla FileSystem object which we have no control over. However, for any FilsSystem access in HoodieStorageWriter we register the HoodieWrapperFileSystem class and use that to read/write data. HoodieWrapperFileSystem provides a good way to monitor/control accesses to the FileSystem. We need such a wrapper to be used throughout the code. One way is to register HoodieWrapperFileSystem as part of HoodieWrite/Read Client implementations from the beginning itself, this way we have a central place to collect these metrics. To actually collect the metrics 1) we could use an accumulator in Spark 2) Create another abstraction like WriteStatus which applies to the entire DAG (although this seems like an overkill).
