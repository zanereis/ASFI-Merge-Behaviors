with @maosongfu and @nlu90 regarding the fix for this.\r\n\r\nIf we change TMaster to take a ZK watch on the packingplan node, it can update it internally immediately when it changes and then build a

That would negate the need for the scheduler to delete the physical plan and for executor0 to restart the TMaster. It also separates concerns better in that the scheduler controls the lifecycle of the packing plan and the TMaster controls the lifecycle of the physical plan.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/307159890/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/307208580","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/1939#issuecomment-307208580","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1939","id":307208580,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNzIwODU4MA==","user":{"login":"srkukarni","id":2530234,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzAyMzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2530234?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni","html_url":"https://github.com/srkukarni","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-08T19:49:47Z","updated_at":"2017-06-08T19:49:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Made the changes wrt arg description based on feedback.

But this pull request does not prevent that and it can benefit topology developers:\r\n1. It provides a mechanism to trigger handlers when encountering abnormal cases. We investigated and discussed with a lot of customers at Twitter. They mentioned the most common abnormal case is back-pressure and the it is always caused by slow hosts - so they recommended the handlers  could be \"restarting that container on another host\". Notice, it does not prevent other handlers; the reason we provide this handler is basing on customers' feedback.\r\n2. This feature is not enabled by default: only when people provide specific flags explicitly and manually can they use this feature. So by default, it will not hurt. Furthermore, restarting a container does not prevent further investigation: we have logs; we have metrics. In future, we could also add something like \"heapdump\", \"snapshot\" before restarting to help debug. Besides those, keeping an instance running will not help debug too much, since we have limited interactive runtime debugging solutions.\r\n3. It will reduce the down-time of a topology, consider at Twitter env, most topologies are actually in \"down-time\" if they can not recover in certain mins (that's also what this pull request designs for). It will also reduce the maintenance cost. Customers want this feature very much.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/308246631/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/308249693","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/issues/932#issuecomment-308249693","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/932","id":308249693,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwODI0OTY5Mw==","user":{"login":"srkukarni","id":2530234,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzAyMzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2530234?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni","html_url":"https://github.com/srkukarni","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-13T21:10:40Z","updated_at":"2017-06-13T21:10:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"What scheduler are you using?

Following the same patter for the TMaster is consistent.\r\n- The initial deployment should be able to proceed without a requirement that the deploying user (where the scheduler-as-a-library might run) maintains a connection to the topology for the entire startup phase. So the client puts some state in statemanager and if that succeeds it launches the aurora containers and it's done. From then on the topology can initialize itself.
