So there are two options:\r\n\r\n1. For users who have such requirement, they can set the align value of the last element to be `'right'`:\r\n```\r\n    xAxis: {\r\n        data: ['Sun', 'Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', {\r\n            value: 'Satxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxy',\r\n            textStyle: {\r\n                align: 'right'\r\n            }\r\n        }],\r\n        axisLabel: {\r\n            interval: 4,\r\n            showMinLabel: true,\r\n            showMaxLabel: true,\r\n            align: 'left'\r\n        }\r\n    },\r\n```\r\nResult:\r\n<img width=\"808\" alt=\"屏幕快照 2020-03-02 13 58 19\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/779050/75649502-3d31b280-5c8e-11ea-9b4f-75b8e8300f4b.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n2. We change the source code and set the last label to be `'right'` for all cases, or if the last label is larger than the given space.\r\n\r\nApparently, setting the last label to be `'right'` for all cases is a bad solution for simple cases like:\r\n<img width=\"830\" alt=\"屏幕快照 2020-03-02 13 52 09\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/779050/75649357-d3190d80-5c8d-11ea-989b-8d9b57939360.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nI would suggest that we remain the logic simple and let the user decide whether they need to align the last label to right.
