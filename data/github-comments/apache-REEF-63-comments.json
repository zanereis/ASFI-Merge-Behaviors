I believe this could be simplified in a couple of dimensions:\n1. Remove changes to code other than INRU. None of the Examples are likely to gain fault tolerance anytime soon. And if they do, we can make that its own series of PRs.\n2. Remove accidental changes like the renames to parameters to `.OnNext()` calls.\n3. Most importantly: Move the logic for state keeping and gang scheduling into its own classes. Rx makes this sort of code very elegant. We could have a pipeline of Subjects that receive `ActiveContext` and `FailedContext` events. At the end of that pipeline, a collection of `ActiveContexts` pops out which is observed by another Subject that submits the tasks and changes the status of the IMRU Driver.\n\nStylistically, this adds a couple of places where `ArgumentException` is thrown in relation to collection entries.
