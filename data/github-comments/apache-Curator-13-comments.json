This means that a bunch of objects are not going to be cleaned up the GC. I'm not sure what the solution is though. Maybe the NodeCache needs to keep track of all of its Watcher references and ask for them to be removed from the NamespaceWatcherMap when it closes.

The second curator thread is being blocked because the checkTimeouts() method is synchronized, but the root of it is that the packet.finished state is not being reached for some reason.
