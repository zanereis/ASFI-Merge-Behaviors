The sentence object is meant to be scoped to a single translation of a sentence.  For calls to probRule this helps disambiguate. \n\nFor estimate I'm not so sure.  A rule can have estimateRuleCost called on it even when Joshua is not translation anything. For example as a result of calling sort on a grammar during startup before any requests are processed.  In fact the only usage of estimate being called perviously was passing null as the argument for sentence.  For the time being I'm creating the ChartState object once per call, and then immediately releasing it afterwards.  We'll have to test the performance impact of doing this, but this shouldn't actually be called when decoding so hopefully it won't affect decoding perf.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/joshua/issues/comments/248232808/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/joshua/issues/comments/248429307","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/joshua/pull/65#issuecomment-248429307","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/joshua/issues/65","id":248429307,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0ODQyOTMwNw==","user":{"login":"mjpost","id":455256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/455256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjpost","html_url":"https://github.com/mjpost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjpost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjpost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjpost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjpost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjpost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjpost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjpost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjpost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjpost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-20T20:47:57Z","updated_at":"2016-09-20T20:47:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I did some timing tests on commit 3ba83f84e8258a784fcef509fc9b158d44f15c66, and didn't see any change.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/joshua/issues/comments/248429307/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/joshua/issues/comments/248608405","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/joshua/pull/65#issuecomment-248608405","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/joshua/issues/65","id":248608405,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0ODYwODQwNQ==","user":{"login":"KellenSunderland","id":7443219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NDMyMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7443219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland","html_url":"https://github.com/KellenSunderland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-21T13:14:18Z","updated_at":"2016-09-21T13:14:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Well in that case I can open a PR without the DirectBuffer changes included.

thanks @thammegowda.  One thing to be aware of is that as you increase JVM memory you effectively take away memory from KenLM.  What I've done in the past is just run a quick Java Flight Recorder session to verify the issue is excess garbage collection.  If it it then increasing jvm args is the way to go.
