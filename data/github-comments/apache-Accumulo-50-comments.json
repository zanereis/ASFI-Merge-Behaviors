Something that could help determine that, is there a timing difference when there is a large number of candidate and few deletes vs a large number of candidates and lots of deletes?  The first case may provide insight into the Accumulo overhead, while the second could be dominated by hdfs.\r\nThe overall goal is to determine if there is are situations where Accumulo could get into a state where it just cannot keep up with deletes and would fall further and further behind. If that can be shown, then what are the triggering conditions and where are the bottle necks, and does batch size have any impact?\r\n\r\nSome of this could be simulated, but there also needs to measurements that include hdfs interactions. If it can be shown that the Accumulo gc process is never a bottle neck regardless of batch size, then we know to focus on hdfs interactions for additional performance improvements.

Usually, `mvn clean verify` is sufficient.\r\nSee: https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html#usual-command-line-calls and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50260921/differences-between-mvn-install-and-mvn-verify\r\nMany guides will suggest using `install` instead of `verify`, and this has led many Maven users to use it when they shouldn't. There are appropriate times to do use it, but they aren't common, and I think a lot of beginner Maven users have been misled by online guides. The only appropriate time to use `install` is when you actually need to have a copy of your built artifacts available in your local Maven repository. Otherwise, you should use `verify` (or just `package`, if you just need to build the artifacts, but don't need to run ITs afterwards).\r\n\r\nEDIT: Also, thanks for the contribution! :smiley_cat: ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/667410610/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/667412940","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1669#issuecomment-667412940","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1669","id":667412940,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2NzQxMjk0MA==","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-31T22:31:49Z","updated_at":"2020-07-31T22:31:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I worry that automatic merging could be used for people to shoot themselves in the foot, so to speak, with respect to performance. Any time Accumulo does something \"automatically\", it can be a surprise for users. For example, adding this could lead to situations where users unintentionally configure it to delete empty tablets, and then lose all benefits from pre-splitting tables at creation time to prep for efficient distributed bulk ingest.\r\n\r\nBaking this feature into Accumulo, would also add significant complexity into Accumulo's own code without much benefit to being there, vs. being a client side process. It seems to me that a client-side process could easily trigger merges as needed, without introducing this complexity internal to Accumulo, and it would perform just as well.\r\n\r\nIn general, I'd prefer to reduce complexity in Accumulo, and modularize functionality, unless there is a clear benefit to being baked-in to justify the added complexity.

The only appropriate time to use `install` is when you actually need to have a copy of your built artifacts available in your local Maven repository.

Filling up your hard drive with unneeded copies of SNAPSHOT builds\r\n2. Misconfigured dependencies in your project could be unintentionally resolved from your local repository when they fail to resolve from your multi-module reactor build or from your remote repository, where you expect them to exist, but don't. This will result in builds that only work for you, but not for anybody else.\r\n3. Confusing code breakage that can be hard to troubleshoot, because code is behaving the way you *used* to have it, but you *fixed that bug already*, and your Maven build is resolving from your local repository instead of the fixed version you intend on your class path.\r\n\r\nI'm sure there are others, but these are the ones I've seen most often. Sometimes you need to, though. For example, if you need to build a dependency for the purposes of testing it in a separate Maven project's build. When that happens for me, I try to purge these artifacts from my local repository once I'm done, so they don't pollute future builds.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/667416792/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/668015359","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1639#issuecomment-668015359","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1639","id":668015359,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2ODAxNTM1OQ==","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-03T13:13:19Z","updated_at":"2020-08-03T13:13:19Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Closing based on lack of response to previous comment.

The generated record for the IT test tserver looks like:\r\n\r\n`1596645249079 tserver.compactionExecutors: Context=tserver, ProcessName=TabletServer, Hostname=ip-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx, default_large_queued=0, default_large_running=0, default_medium_queued=0, default_medium_running=0, default_small_queued=0, default_small_running=0, meta_huge_queued=0, meta_huge_running=0, meta_small_queued=0, meta_small_running=0, root_small_queued=0, root_small_running=0, root_huge_queued=0, root_huge_running=0, default_any_queued=0, default_any_running=1`\r\n\r\nThis looks good, but why is default_any_running=1 but nothing in default large, medium or small?  Is default_any a separate queue, or should it be the sum of all default_any_ ?\r\n\r\nWith this forced test, I know the FATE transaction is \"IN_PROGRESS\"  - it uses a slow compaction runner that pauses 250ms in the iterator before each next() call - could that be changing the \"running\" to something where the thread is paused and that does not count as \"running\" \r\n\r\nBefore digging I just want to validate that my assumptions w.r.t the names is accurate.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/669311242/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/669455822","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/1334#issuecomment-669455822","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1334","id":669455822,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2OTQ1NTgyMg==","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-05T19:46:14Z","updated_at":"2020-08-05T19:46:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"There has been no response in almost 11 months since the last code review feedback, and the PR now has merge conflicts.

ZooReaderWriter retries on session expired exceptions.\r\n 2. ZooReaderWriter automatically gets a new zookeeper when one is closed.\r\n\r\nFor issue 1, looking at the code zoolock code it deals mainly deals with session expired in watcher.  As far as I can tell ZooReaderWriter does not alter events from watcher at the moment.  For other code in ZooLock, its difficult to analyze the impact of ZooReaderWriter retrying on session expired.  There were a few places I was concerned about that seemed like they may work by accident.  So for concern 1 I have yet to identify an actual bug through code analysis, but I suspect there could be potential bugs.\r\n\r\nFor concern 2, I did find an actual race condition that seems like it could result in erroneous data being placed in the metadata table.\r\n\r\nIn the code below, ZooLock calls ZooReaderWriter.getZooKeeper().getSessionId() to compute its LockId\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/accumulo/blob/rel/1.9.3/fate/src/main/java/org/apache/accumulo/fate/zookeeper/ZooLock.java#L358-L363\r\n\r\nBelow is the code for ZooReaderWriter.getZooKeeper().  If you follow this code you will see that it creates a new Zookeeper if the current one is closed.  For the above code that is problematic, because a new ZK object would have a different session id.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/accumulo/blob/rel/1.9.3/fate/src/main/java/org/apache/accumulo/fate/zookeeper/ZooReaderWriter.java#L48-L54\r\n\r\nThe code below is called by the tablet server and based on the previous code may put the wrong id in the metadata table.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/accumulo/blob/rel/1.9.3/server/base/src/main/java/org/apache/accumulo/server/util/MetadataTableUtil.java#L135-L138\r\n \r\nFor this particular case a fix may be to make ZooLock.getLockID call ZooLock.getSessionId() instead of ZooLock.zooKeeper.getZooKeeper().getSessionId().  But I am not completely sure.  Anyway this is one example of how the zookeeper silently switching under zoolock could be problematic, there may be other cases.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/670084908/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/670087213","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1298#issuecomment-670087213","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1298","id":670087213,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3MDA4NzIxMw==","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-06T18:00:58Z","updated_at":"2020-08-06T18:00:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@milleruntime I will look into this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/670087213/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
