how (difficult it is) to currently achieve direct Pulsar Broker access on Kubernetes:\r\n\r\n1. change Broker deployment to a `StatefulSet` (go by how the Bookkeeper deploy is spec'd)\r\n2. change Broker service to type `NodePort` and add `externalTrafficPolicy: Local`\r\n3. comment out the line `clusterIP: None` from the Broker service\r\n4. change *both* Broker internal and external `pulsar://` ports to `30002` in `values.yaml`\r\n    - this involves adding a `nodePort: 30002` line\r\n5. add `brokerServicePort: \"30002\"` to Broker's configData in `values.yaml`\r\n6. change `advertisedAddress` in Broker deploy from `status.podIP` to `status.hostIP`\r\n7. use `pulsar://your-k8s-node1-or-ip:30002,your-k8s-node1-or-ip:30002/` type of URL for your Pulsar client\r\n\r\nThis
