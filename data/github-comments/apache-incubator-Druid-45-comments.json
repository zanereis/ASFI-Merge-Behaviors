So it can be applied to all kind of queries but whether it has any meaning is a different question. \n\nFor example, descending processing of time-series queries will make descending ordered result(good). But for group-by queries, the order of processing has no meaning and there are another ordering spec for result ordering in it. For search queries? because druid just lookups index and dictionary, it just not have meaning of order of processing.\n\nI think time-series and search queries can make differences by this.

But I need it, it's a live system and I wanted to limit data to only a test account. \nI submitted topn and groupby queries without a filter for you, at once hoping that both run between events (no events happen between). Here is a result: \n\n<pre>\n$ druid-query groupby_all.json ; druid-query topn_all.json\n[ {\n  \"version\" : \"v1\",\n  \"timestamp\" : \"2015-12-07T18:25:00.000Z\",\n  \"event\" : {\n<b>    \"count\" : 161,\n    \"orientation_change\" : null </b>\n  }\n}, {\n  \"version\" : \"v1\",\n  \"timestamp\" : \"2015-12-07T18:25:00.000Z\",\n  \"event\" : {\n    \"count\" : 1870,\n    \"orientation_change\" : \"0\"\n  }\n}, {\n  \"version\" : \"v1\",\n  \"timestamp\" : \"2015-12-07T18:25:00.000Z\",\n  \"event\" : {\n    \"count\" : 7331,\n    \"orientation_change\" : \"1\"\n  }\n} ][ {\n  \"timestamp\" : \"2015-12-07T18:25:00.000Z\",\n  \"result\" : [ {\n    \"count\" : 7331,\n    \"orientation_change\" : \"1\"\n  }, {\n    \"count\" : 1870,\n    \"orientation_change\" : \"0\"\n  }, {\n<b>    \"count\" : 133,\n    \"orientation_change\" : null </b>\n  } ]\n} ]\n</pre>\n\nPlease note the difference between groups with orientation_change: null . \n\n@gianm , If you mean I should use longSum instead of count, then actually, I was using longSum of count in my original queries. I replaced them with counts to simplify examples for this issue submission.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/162632025/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/162634381","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/2059#issuecomment-162634381","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2059","id":162634381,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MjYzNDM4MQ==","user":{"login":"kzarzycki","id":4157788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNTc3ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4157788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzarzycki","html_url":"https://github.com/kzarzycki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzarzycki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzarzycki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzarzycki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzarzycki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzarzycki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzarzycki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzarzycki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzarzycki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzarzycki/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-07T19:32:24Z","updated_at":"2015-12-07T19:32:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I understand, that realtime spec might be valuable to you.
