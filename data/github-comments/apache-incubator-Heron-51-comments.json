Here are some discussions result\r\n\r\n1. Looping through vector and sum all `getSpaceUsed` calls results are quite heavy. If we want to do a cap here, how can we determine if we should put it back or delete in a *fast* way? I was thinking to use a thread to calculate mempool size constantly, so when every time we can release, we don't need to loop over to sum message size. Yes, this idea is naive because i did not consider thread-safety, blah blah. \r\n\r\n2. 50MB limit is probably not what we want here. As you can see, `N5heron5proto5stmgr19TupleStreamMessage2E` counts most of the usage. What we are doing here is equivalent to limit whole mempool to  around 50MB...\r\n\r\n3. We managed to get a stacktrace. See it [here](https://gist.github.com/objmagic/13a59d0efcc7dcacd096dec59fd9d720). As we can see, `add_data_tuple` calls append, which calls reserve in string library, which calls `_S_create`. When we do heap profiling, we see `_S_create` is the largest source of heap memory usage. Putting this observation here if you are interested details of heap usage.\r\n\r\nThis observation leads to one point: Message object, which is being constantly put back and taken out from mempool, will keep growing because every time the number of tuples you put is more than ever before, we need to reserve more memory. But we believe it will stop at a certain size.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/315269826/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/315272557","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/2011#issuecomment-315272557","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/2011","id":315272557,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNTI3MjU1Nw==","user":{"login":"objmagic","id":3656079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTYwNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3656079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic","html_url":"https://github.com/objmagic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-14T05:19:52Z","updated_at":"2017-07-14T05:19:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"and to answer question why stmgr memory usage issue gets worse when we switch to 0.14.9.1 from 0.14.8.

The memory leaks are leaks, adding a limit is just adding a cap to these leaks, doesn't resolve them at all. How would you expect users to figure out how many messages they actually need?\r\n\r\nThe real solution here is probably to explore the new protobuf arena API to see how we can integrate it with mempool. But that requires protobuf 3.0 at least, fortunately I already have this here: https://github.com/twitter/heron/tree/cwang/protobuf30","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/315913302/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/315914988","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/2073#issuecomment-315914988","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/2073","id":315914988,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNTkxNDk4OA==","user":{"login":"srkukarni","id":2530234,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzAyMzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2530234?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni","html_url":"https://github.com/srkukarni","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-17T23:33:56Z","updated_at":"2017-07-17T23:33:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@congwang unless I'm mistaken, afaik, we are not talking about memory leak here.

This solution does not look nice to me either.\r\n\r\n@srkukarni @congwang I have a theory about the cause of \"memory leak\". If one does not call `Clear` on `Message`, used space in `Message` will not be zero'ed out. So next time we add tuple in it, `Message` thinks it does not have enough space and will enlarge the strings in itself. C++ STL will reserve extra space in string when you append (just like how it uses some heuristics to reserve extra space for vector).

Messages try to keep around any memory they allocate for reuse, even when they are cleared. Thus, if you are handling many messages with the same type and similar structure in succession, it is a good idea to reuse the same message object each time to take load off the memory allocator. However, objects can become bloated over time, especially if your messages vary in \"shape\" or if you occasionally construct a message that is much larger than usual. You should monitor the sizes of your message objects by calling the SpaceUsed method and delete them once they get too big.\r\n\r\nSo even if you do `Clear` you still have some *kind of* memory leak (and therefore assumption @objmagic made still make sense).\r\n\r\nHaving limited number of objects in pool can fix this issue thou: they will be rotated over the time so most likely each message eventually will be deleted. Having big enough pool at the same time almost guarantee all messages will only become bigger and memory will keep increasing.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/315961783/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/316129964","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/2073#issuecomment-316129964","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/2073","id":316129964,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNjEyOTk2NA==","user":{"login":"objmagic","id":3656079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTYwNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3656079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic","html_url":"https://github.com/objmagic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-18T17:03:25Z","updated_at":"2017-07-18T17:03:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@srkukarni You are right.
