href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-537\" title=\"A worker reconnects infinitely to another dead worker\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-537\"><del>STORM-537</del></a> A worker reconnects infinitely to another dead worker</p>\n\n<p>    A fix for <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-537\" title=\"A worker reconnects infinitely to another dead worker\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-537\"><del>STORM-537</del></a>(<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-537\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-537</a>). The bug is that a worker reconnects to another dead worker infinitely when it tries to send a batch of messages. Each message in a batch causes a new reconnect. More details are in the jira issue.</p>\n\n<p>    Pull request contains a simple fix and tests. Actually there is \"test-reconnect-to-permanently-failed-server\" which is exactly for this bug. There is also \"test-reconnect-to-temporarily-failed-server\" which was written just-for-fun, because this functionality is not covered by other tests.</p>\n\n<p>    Note, that storm with applied fix works well and fixed the issue on our staging environment.</p>\n\n<p>You can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:</p>\n\n<p>    $ git pull <a

ShellBolt, the _readerThread read command from python/shell process, and handle like this:<br/>\n    try<br/>\n    </p>\n{ \n    ShellMsg shellMsg = _process.readShellMsg(); \n    ... \n    }\n<p>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n    harshach commented on 21 Aug<br/>\n    @dashengju Can you clarify \"getProcessTerminationInfoString will be hang because processErrorStream have no data to read\". Which case it might hang , looking at the code <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/incubator-storm/blob/master/storm-core/src/jvm/backtype/storm/utils/ShellProcess.java#L135\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/incubator-storm/blob/master/storm-core/src/jvm/backtype/storm/utils/ShellProcess.java#L135</a> If there is no data in processErrorStream it returns empty string.<br/>\n    If possible can you add a unit test. Thanks.</p>\n\n<p>    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n    d2r added a note 29 days ago<br/>\n    I think we should change ShellProcess#getErrorsStream so that it checks that there is actually something to read.</p>\n\n<p>    This would fix a couple of other places where a hang looks possible:</p>\n\n<p>    <a

@dashengju, any update on this pull request?</p>\n\n<p>    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ <br/>\n    dashengju commented 15 hours

suggestion?</p>\n\n<p>    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n    HeartSaVioR commented 5 hours ago<br/>\n    Is there a relation between parent process's exception and subprocess's stderr?<br/>\n    If it's not, and we should capture it from parent, I think spout may have stderr reader with new thread.<br/>\n    Because it may not be right way to capture it when only parent process raises exception.</p>\n\n<p>    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ <br/>\n    dashengju commented an hour ago<br/>\n    @HeartSaVioR , <br/>\n    parent process's exception contains two types: 1) net io error caused; for example, subprocess report an error to stderr and exit; 2) parent process's handle logic exception.<br/>\n    as 1), we want to read from stderr to get more information; <br/>\n    as 2), as you say, it may not be right way to capture it when only parent process raises exception.</p>\n\n<p>    @d2r 's suggestion, we should change ShellProcess#getErrorsStream so that it checks that there is actually something to read.</p>\n\n<p>You can merge this pull
