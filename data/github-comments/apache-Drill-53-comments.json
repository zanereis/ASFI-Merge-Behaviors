I have spent some time investigating the issues and even found how to fix listing for SQL Standard mode. But performance acceptable solution for Storage Based mode is still unknown. I think that listing of only accessible tables wasn't Drill users requirement, and in case of such Jira appearance it should be implemented as finalized feature with acceptable performance and consistency for both authorization modes. Until Drill users require the feature, it'll be much better to return all tables as fast as possible.

Just to refine a bit.\r\n\r\nBy default, if code using the row set framework asks to convert strings to other types, blanks have no special meaning. A blank will be parsed as any other string, which typically produces an error.\r\n\r\nAny client of the row set framework can specify a blank-handling policy. Using an internal property set. The name of this internal property is `blank-as`. There are four choices:\r\n\r\n* Unset: use the default policy described above.\r\n* `null`: If the column is nullable, treat the blank as null. If non-nullable, leave the blank unchanged.\r\n* `0`: Replace blanks with the value \"0\" for numeric types.\r\n* `skip`: Skip blank values. This will set the column to its default value: `NULL` for nullable columns, the default value for non-nullable columns. If no default is set, then the \"default default\" of all-zero bytes is used.\r\n\r\n(Note that I renamed \"simple\" to \"skip\".)\r\n\r\nNormally, the blank policy is set by the reader. For example for CSV, it seemed to make sense to use the `skip` policy.\r\n\r\nBut, to provide maximum flexibility (and because there are many different requirements), the user can also optionally set the `drill.blank-as` property on a column. If set, that property overrides anything the reader may have set. For example, suppose I want to use -1 for missing columns, but 0 for blank columns. I could set the column default value to -1, then set the `drill.blank-as` property to `0`.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line for users of the CSV file format, with a schema, is that, by default, blanks are skipped and either become `NULL` or the default value.\r\n\r\nNote also that this change strips leading and trailing white space from columns prior to type conversion. So a value of \"  \" is trimmed to \"\" and treated as a blank string. Trimming is *not* done for values stored as VARCHAR. In this case, if the value is \"  \", that is what will be stored in the vector.\r\n\r\nThis is all a first draft. Let's get this into the hands of users as an \"alpha\", get some feedback, and adjust the code based on what we learn.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/480639697/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/480688297","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1739#issuecomment-480688297","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1739","id":480688297,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MDY4ODI5Nw==","user":{"login":"vdiravka","id":11904420,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTA0NDIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11904420?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdiravka","html_url":"https://github.com/vdiravka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdiravka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdiravka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdiravka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdiravka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdiravka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdiravka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdiravka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdiravka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdiravka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-08T05:26:14Z","updated_at":"2019-04-08T05:26:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@agozhiy Could you please take a look?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/480688297/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/480707171","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1726#issuecomment-480707171","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1726","id":480707171,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MDcwNzE3MQ==","user":{"login":"paul-rogers","id":3248881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDg4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3248881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers","html_url":"https://github.com/paul-rogers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-08T06:55:02Z","updated_at":"2019-04-08T06:55:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Squashed commits.
