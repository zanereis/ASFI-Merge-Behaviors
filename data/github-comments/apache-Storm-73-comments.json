ShellBolt side control</p>\n\n<p>We can modify ShellBolt to have sent tuple ids list, and stop sending tuples when list exceeds configured max value. In order to achieve this, subprocess should notify \"tuple id is complete\" to ShellBolt.</p>\n\n<ul class=\"alternate\" type=\"square\">\n\t<li>It introduces new commands for multi-lang, \"proceed\" (or better name)</li>\n\t<li>ShellBolt stores in-progress-of-processing tuples list.</li>\n\t<li>Its overhead could be big, subprocess should always notify to ShellBolt when any tuples are processed.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>B. subprocess side control</p>\n\n<p>We can modify subprocess to check pending queue after reading tuple.<br/>\nIf it exceeds configured max value, subprocess can request \"delay\" to ShellBolt for slowing down.<br/>\nWhen ShellBolt receives \"delay\", BoltWriterRunnable should stop polling pending queue and continue polling later.</p>\n\n<p>How long ShellBolt wait for resending? Its unit would be \"delay time\" or \"tuple count\". I don't know which is better yet.</p>\n\n<ul class=\"alternate\" type=\"square\">\n\t<li>It introduces new commands for multi-lang, \"delay\" (or better name)</li>\n\t<li>I don't think it would be introduced soon, but subprocess can request delay based on own statistics. (ex. pending tuple count * average tuple processed time for time unit, average pending tuple count for count unit)\n\t<ul class=\"alternate\" type=\"square\">\n\t\t<li>We can leave when and how much to request \"delay\" to user. User can make his/her own algorithm to control flooding.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>In my opinion B seems to more natural cause current issue is by subprocess side so it would be better to let subprocess overcome it.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612535172/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/89184522","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/501#issuecomment-89184522","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/501","id":89184522,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg5MTg0NTIy","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-03T06:26:13Z","updated_at":"2015-04-03T06:26:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks

Taylor Goetz</a> we are going to release that Kafka consumer API in the next release. I believe it should cover the needs you guys have and should dramatically simplify the kafka-storm code--it internally handles server failure, partition migration, offset storage, etc, but gives you full control over partition assignment and offset commit points which are the needs of a stream processing system. This should also remove all unnecessary threading from your code too as the consumer is fully non-blocking. Prior to the Kafka release it would be great if someone who knows the storm-kafka integration well could do a deep dive and just validate that these apis would indeed cover your needs and also validate that it would really significantly simplify your life. We think both should be true, but it would be good to check so we can make changes if needed. Once it is released we will have to break compatibility with each change so flushing these things out now is just much easier.</p>\n\n<p>I'd be happy to jump on a quick call to discuss if that is useful.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612523375/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/89620855","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/442#issuecomment-89620855","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/442","id":89620855,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg5NjIwODU1","user":{"login":"Parth-Brahmbhatt","id":6914358,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MTQzNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6914358?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt","html_url":"https://github.com/Parth-Brahmbhatt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-04T17:24:47Z","updated_at":"2015-04-04T17:24:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Lewuathe The metrics is already stored in zookeeper what you need to do is ensure the thrift structure has serialization metric as an additional field (point 2) and change the converter https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/storm-core/src/clj/backtype/storm/stats.clj#L369 to handle conversion from the clojure metric to thrift metrics and vice versa.

things look fairly good.  The only issue is that we are adding in new data to the heartbeat.  If we want to be able to do a rolling upgrade we need to make sure that the new stat change is optional, and that we don't expect it to always be there when we read.  For example there is a topology up and running.  If nimbus is upgraded before any of the workers are, nimbus will crash because the new data is not there.
