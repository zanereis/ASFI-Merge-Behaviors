on this PR.\n\nBased on the scope of the code changes and the unit testing that has been introduced, this addresses the use-case of being able query tables based on a hierarchy of columns that take a primary column and partition columns into consideration.\n\nI did not run this against a live database, so the committer may want to do that for a sanity check.  The unit tests pass and look like they cover the hierarchical partitioned query use cases, and they use Derby as the database.\n\nThere is one known issue that could occur with partitioning, in that not all data would be fetched from a partition if new data comes in that provides a new value for a partition column before all the data in the previous partition was retrieved. According to @mattyb149, this is an edge case.  I think this issue can be avoided with flow design to account for this, at any rate.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/245064669/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/245065829","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/987#issuecomment-245065829","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/987","id":245065829,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NTA2NTgyOQ==","user":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-06T19:40:37Z","updated_at":"2016-09-06T19:40:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"With the new commit, all looks good from a code review perspective.
