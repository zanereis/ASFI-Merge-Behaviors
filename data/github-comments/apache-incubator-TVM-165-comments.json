I got your point from the last comment. But one of these scenarios is special. It was not possible to hit from python test cases. That is the reason i added in cpp test case. And i believe that the unit test cases should be in cpp, not in python, as the back-end implementations are in cpp. Python test cases should be used for functional tests. But that is my belief. I hope i didn't misunderstood your comment. Please help me clarify if i am mistaken.

this has unnecessary effect (nondeterminism).\r\n> can you make it input a random seed and output a random seed?\r\n@MarisaKirisame : Thank you for your inputs. The original intent here was if the user would provide an input seed(as per the user choice) and desired shape of RNG object, then the function would generate the RNG object based on the input seed value. If the user uses the same seed(seed value != 0) again in the same session, he would get the same RNG or PRNG object. Only when seed value == 0, non-determinism kicks in and the RNG object would be different for each run in a given session.\r\nDoes it make sense? Let me know if I understood you correctly and the response is on the same lines.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/593815922/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/593853267","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4933#issuecomment-593853267","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4933","id":593853267,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5Mzg1MzI2Nw==","user":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-03T09:31:33Z","updated_at":"2020-03-03T09:31:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks @zhiics @comaniac @mbaret @lhutton1 @soiferj ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/593853267/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/593879824","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/4534#issuecomment-593879824","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4534","id":593879824,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5Mzg3OTgyNA==","user":{"login":"YunLexi","id":15028187,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDI4MTg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15028187?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YunLexi","html_url":"https://github.com/YunLexi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YunLexi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YunLexi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YunLexi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YunLexi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YunLexi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YunLexi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YunLexi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YunLexi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YunLexi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-03T10:33:02Z","updated_at":"2020-03-03T10:33:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@trevor-m \r\nHi, I get the same problem when I try to use relay.build() to build a resnet101, with target as Cuda, but it works fine if I change the model to resnet18.
