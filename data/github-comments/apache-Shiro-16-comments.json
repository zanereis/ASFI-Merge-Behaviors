However, the Shiro change is correct.\r\n`<dependencyManagement>` is the correct tag for BOM files. It was incorrect before.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, you should remove the BOM line from your gradle file. It's not needed at all.\r\nThat's the simplest fix to your issue. I tested it and it brings in all transitive dependencies correctly.\r\n\r\nIf, for some reason, you do need to use BOM (i.e. Jakarta artifacts), the correct usage for maven BOM is:\r\n```\r\nplugins {\r\n        id 'java'\r\n        id 'org.springframework.boot' version '3.1.2'\r\n}\r\n\r\nrepositories {\r\n        mavenCentral()\r\n}\r\n\r\napply plugin: 'io.spring.dependency-management'\r\n\r\ndependencyManagement {\r\n  imports {\r\n    mavenBom 'org.apache.shiro:shiro-bom:1.12.0'\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\ndependencies {\r\n        implementation 'org.apache.shiro:shiro-web'\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWith Gradle, the \"BOM\" term is overloaded. \"Gradle BOM\" is not the same as \"Maven BOM\" which is what Shiro is.\r\n\r\nI am going to close this issue, please feel free to reopen if the above solution doesn't work for you for some reason.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/comments/1644694815/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/comments/1644708943","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues/1010#issuecomment-1644708943","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/1010","id":1644708943,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAARy8s5iCERP","user":{"login":"lprimak","id":1002484,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDI0ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1002484?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak","html_url":"https://github.com/lprimak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-20T22:32:28Z","updated_at":"2023-07-20T22:32:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Seems simple just to upgrade, but I am not opposed to jsoup either","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/comments/1644708943/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/comments/1645103227","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues/1014#issuecomment-1645103227","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/1014","id":1645103227,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAARy8s5iDkh7","user":{"login":"boris-petrov","id":278940,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3ODk0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/278940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/boris-petrov","html_url":"https://github.com/boris-petrov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boris-petrov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boris-petrov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boris-petrov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boris-petrov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boris-petrov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boris-petrov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boris-petrov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boris-petrov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boris-petrov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-21T07:21:32Z","updated_at":"2023-07-21T07:21:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@lprimak thanks for all the time you spent on this!\r\n\r\nI'm really not sure what you mean though. As far as I understand, [BOM files](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/platforms.html#sub:bom_import) are just a list of dependency-versions. And that's what I used them for. I added the BOM and then in the couple of places I used Shiro, I simply didn't add a version. In addition to that, BOMs define versions for transitive dependencies that are known/needed to work with the library. I definitely could use Shiro without a BOM (that's what I did for 1.12.0) - it's just simpler with it. And DRY-er because I'm not repeating versions.\r\n\r\nYou're right that maybe the BOM in version 1.11.0 was \"wrong\" in some way, not sure about that. What I request is pretty much the same BOM as in [1.12.0](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/shiro-root-1.12.0/bom/pom.xml) to be available to the non-Jakarta version of Shiro - i.e. (I think) just without the `<classifier>jakarta</classifier>` lines.\r\n\r\nDoes that make sense or am I mistaking some concepts? :smile: ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/comments/1645103227/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/comments/1645109941","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues/1015#issuecomment-1645109941","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/1015","id":1645109941,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAARy8s5iDmK1","user":{"login":"boris-petrov","id":278940,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3ODk0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/278940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/boris-petrov","html_url":"https://github.com/boris-petrov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boris-petrov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boris-petrov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boris-petrov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boris-petrov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boris-petrov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boris-petrov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boris-petrov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boris-petrov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boris-petrov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-21T07:25:28Z","updated_at":"2023-07-21T07:25:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@lprimak I answered in the issue a bit more but here I wanted to ask about this specific thing you said:\r\n\r\n> The only reason there is a BOM for Jakarta is that every Shiro artifact has to have exclusions and needs to be individually included by application developer. ...
