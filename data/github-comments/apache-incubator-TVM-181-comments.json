I'm concerned that if we enforce annotation of individual constant nodes, MergeCompilerRegions will become a necessary pass to run. Otherwise we'll generate partitions just containing a ConstantNode.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that if someone runs `AnnotateTarget`, there's no reason for her to skip `MergeCompilerRegions`. If she wrote her own annotate pass, then those cases should be handled by herself. Originally I was even thinking to put `AnnotateTarget` and `MergeCompilerRegions` in the same pass, but we have consented to have separate passes so that we can have higher flexibility for the merging algorithm.\r\n\r\n> It looks like the refactor to AnnotatedRegionSet has broken this 'fix'. I think the important property to maintain is that 'every node should belong to a region' rather than 'every node should be annotated'.\r\n\r\nI agree with you that every node should belong to a region is an important property we should maintain in `AnnotateRegionSet`. I'm just concerned about treating `ConstantNode` as a special node. In this case, we have to be aware of `ConstantNode` everywhere in this infra, or we will easily introduce bugs when improving one of them otherwise. I'm hoping that we could deal with the constant nodes in `AnnotateTarget` pass and let other passes treat constant nodes as other nodes. For example like you have illustrated, this graph requires `AnnotateRegionSet` to deal with consant nodes:\r\n\r\n```\r\ninput\r\n  |\r\nbegin\r\n  |\r\n op -- const\r\n  |\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut for this graph, `AnnotateRegionSet` can treat `const` as a normal op:\r\n\r\n```\r\ninput\r\n  |\r\nbegin\r\n  |\r\n op -- begin -- end -- const -- begin\r\n  |\r\n end\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/619198333/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/619201349","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/5382#issuecomment-619201349","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5382","id":619201349,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxOTIwMTM0OQ==","user":{"login":"wpan11nv","id":60017475,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMDE3NDc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60017475?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wpan11nv","html_url":"https://github.com/wpan11nv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wpan11nv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wpan11nv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wpan11nv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wpan11nv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wpan11nv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wpan11nv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wpan11nv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wpan11nv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wpan11nv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-24T19:31:07Z","updated_at":"2020-04-24T21:19:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Can we make it explicit, e.g by tagging the binding iter_var with \"warp\" scope.

Right now String is serialized as an normal object.

Some (e.g., TupleGetItem node) should look at parents while others (ConstantNode) should look at children. Looking at children, is quite tricky with current infrastructure (correct me, If I am wrong).\r\n\r\nTherefore, IMHO I would prefer the current A1) : \r\n\r\ninput\r\n  |\r\nbegin\r\n  |\r\n op -- begin -- const\r\n  |\r\n end\r\n\r\nOR the proposed A2) :\r\n\r\ninput\r\n  |\r\nbegin\r\n  |\r\n op -- const\r\n  |\r\n end\r\n\r\nI fail to see the value addition of annotating constant nodes as they should strictly belong to the region as the op and should not be considered to be merged with other regions. In that light A2 seems appropriate. \r\n\r\nHowever, the current status A1 (though it has an unnecessary boundary) should work in principle as we bind constants (@zhiics ) if they are a input to a region. But I guess, it might fail to recognize constant tuples. We could fix that as an alternative solution. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, @comaniac 's proposal makes it compulsory to run MergeCompilerRegions to avoid creating primitive functions with just a constant node in it. Since we do not have control over the output region size of MergeCompilerRegions (yet), we might not want to annotate constants (yet).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/620500976/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/620648810","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/5462#issuecomment-620648810","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5462","id":620648810,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMDY0ODgxMA==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-28T14:38:46Z","updated_at":"2020-04-28T14:38:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Please open a new troubleshooting thread on https://discuss.tvm.ai/","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/620648810/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/620649433","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/5440#issuecomment-620649433","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5440","id":620649433,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMDY0OTQzMw==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-28T14:39:54Z","updated_at":"2020-04-28T14:39:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"do a `git submodule update --init`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/620649433/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/620674803","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/5409#issuecomment-620674803","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5409","id":620674803,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMDY3NDgwMw==","user":{"login":"zhiics","id":5145158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDUxNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5145158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics","html_url":"https://github.com/zhiics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-28T15:22:47Z","updated_at":"2020-04-28T15:22:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Sorry for the late followup.
