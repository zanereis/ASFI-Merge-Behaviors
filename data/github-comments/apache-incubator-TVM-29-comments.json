For topi.conv2d_nchw, out_channel is before in_channel in kernel layout, while for topi.conv2d_nhwc, out_channel is after in_channel.

\r\n\r\n\"Croping only 2nd and 3rd dimensions\" and \"Always crop based on other tensor shape\" look like a special case consideration to me.\r\n\r\nI suggest below changes for crop/crop_like for consideration to keep it more generalized.\r\n\r\n- TVM/TOPI interface could be (Input Tensor, Array of Offsets, Array Of Lengths) to keep it more independent.\r\n- At NNVM/TOP you could add logic to derive Lengths and Offsets based on inputs and attributes.\r\n- Along with crop_like you could add crop to nnvm which doesn't do anything but call tvm/topi.\r\n\r\nPlease await for others opinion
