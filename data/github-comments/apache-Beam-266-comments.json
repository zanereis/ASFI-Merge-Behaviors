I therefore wonder if we want to use Strutural values to provide a semantic for immutability.\r\nThanks.

Contractually a structural value is a way for a user to provide an object which correctly implements `Object.equals` similar to Guava's EquivalenceWrapper. Since the Java SDK only is meant to rely on structural values when using Java maps and other hashcode/equals methods it should be the only thing we care to test correctly. If the user implements `Object.equals` correctly but structural value incorrectly then its likely we will not do the right thing for them since the SDK uses their type as keys in internal maps. I don't think we can do better then this for immutability testing since if we rely on other methods for checking if things are equal we won't be following the contract that matters to the SDK and that the SDK relies on.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/338716075/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/338721469","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/4022#issuecomment-338721469","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4022","id":338721469,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzODcyMTQ2OQ==","user":{"login":"aaltay","id":696638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjYzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/696638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay","html_url":"https://github.com/aaltay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-23T16:44:18Z","updated_at":"2017-10-23T16:44:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thank you, updated the documentation.
