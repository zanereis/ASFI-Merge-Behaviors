for the cleanup @EdgarLGB - in general, this is a good start. However, I would recommend to split the handling of builtin constants and global variables into two PRs and start with the builtin constants.\r\n\r\nThe current approach prepends assignment statements such `NaN = 0.0/0.0` which does work but could lead to weird behavior because users are still able to assign NaN=7 afterwards - this will likely be very confusing. I would follow R's semantics here and disallow the assignment to NaN and similar constants altogether (R returns the error \"Error in NaN = 7 : invalid (do_set) left-hand side to assignment\"). You can realize this restriction either by extending the ID specification in our ANTLR grammar (e.g., dml.g4) or by extending the validation of assignment and multi-assignment statements. The latter is perhaps the simplest and thus best approach. Once this is done, you could easily replace NaN, PI, INF with const identifiers during syntactic parsing without the need for variable handling.
