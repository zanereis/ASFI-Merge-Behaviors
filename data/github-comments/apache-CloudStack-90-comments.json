@ nvazquez, \nAre you sure that the problem is caused because we are not telling the NFS protocol version to the mount command?\n\nIf you a look at the doc in [1] and [2], you will see that if we do not provide a NFS protocol version to be used, it (the mount program) will first try version 4, then 3, and version 2 as the last one.\n\nIf the default behavior of mount is to try every possible
