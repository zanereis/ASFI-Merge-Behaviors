Yes, you can unsubscribe using the admin interface but that is not the same thing. Allowing the CLI client to unsubscribe itself has two main advantages:\r\n\r\n1. Users without access to the admin interface can unsubscribe\r\n2. Convenience - I suspect that a lot of users use `pulsar-client consume` to check that messages are flowing on a topic and they do not intend the subscription to persist. On our Pulsar test cluster we often see backlogs on subscriptions that were started with the CLI and the user neglected to unsubscribe.\r\n\r\nGoing further, I think it would be good practice to the CLI unsubscribe be default with an option to persist the subscription.\r\n\r\nI know this would not be high priority but would you be opposed to a pull request for this feature if @315157973 or myself were willing to implement it?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/613927526/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/614073061","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/5978#issuecomment-614073061","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/5978","id":614073061,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxNDA3MzA2MQ==","user":{"login":"ivan970101","id":54462321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDYyMzIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54462321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivan970101","html_url":"https://github.com/ivan970101","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivan970101/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivan970101/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivan970101/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivan970101/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivan970101/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivan970101/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivan970101/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivan970101/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivan970101/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-15T14:28:04Z","updated_at":"2020-04-15T14:28:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I'm interested in this issue.
