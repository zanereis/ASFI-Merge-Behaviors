For standalone clusters, I now agree that port ranges might be useful. I would stick to disallowing random ports for standalone clusters though (the task managers would have to try random ports).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/170937659/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/170938227","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1499#issuecomment-170938227","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1499","id":170938227,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MDkzODIyNw==","user":{"login":"uce","id":1756620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTY2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1756620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce","html_url":"https://github.com/uce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-12T14:55:41Z","updated_at":"2016-01-12T14:55:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@darionyaphet Yes, but I would file it as a follow-up.

I think the testing of the REST interface is sufficient, also without having a dedicated YARN test case.  \n\nI had some more comments concerning the failure case handling of stop calls. The first problem is still the handling of exceptions when calling `stop` on the `Invokable` in `Task.stopExecution`. The exception will only be logged but no further action is taken. This can lead to a situation where we have a corrupted state. I think, we should fail the task in such a situation.\n\nAdditionally, the case that a task cannot be found on the `TaskManager` and that an exception occurs in `Task.stopExecution` are treated identically by sending a `TaskOperationResult` with `success == false` to the `JobManager`. On the `JobManager` side this will only be logged. I think the exception case should be handled differently. Failing the execution, for example.\n\nAnd it is still possible that you send a `StopJob` message to the `JobManager`, see that the job is in state `RUNNING`, then the `ExecutionGraph` switches to `RESTARTING`, and then the stop call is executed on the `ExecutionGraph` which won't have an effect. As a user you will receive a `StoppingSuccess` message but the job will simply be restarted. I think we should also allow stopping jobs when they are in the state `RESTARTING`.\n\nWhat do you think?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/170942707/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/170947333","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/750#issuecomment-170947333","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/750","id":170947333,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MDk0NzMzMw==","user":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-12T15:29:01Z","updated_at":"2016-01-12T15:29:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Once we've resolved these problems, I'll test the code on the cluster and YARN.

Best approach is that counting elements in both datasets and decide method to cross, but currently we simply add a parameter to decide this like following:\n\n``` scala\nimport org.apache.flink.api.common.operators.base.CrossOperatorBase.CrossHint\n\nclass KNN {\n  // ...\n\n  def setSizeHint(sizeHint: CrossHint): KNN = {\n    parameters.add(SizeHint, sizeHint)\n    this\n  }\n\n  // ...\n}\n\nobject KNN {\n  // ...\n\n  case object SizeHint extends Parameter[CrossHint] {\n    val defaultValue: Option[CrossHint] = None\n  }\n\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nAnd we can use the parameter in `predictValues` method:\n\n``` scala\nval crossTuned = sizeHint match {\n  case Some(hint) if hint == CrossHint.FIRST_IS_SMALL =>\n    trainingSet.crossWithHuge(inputSplit)\n  case Some(hint) if hint == CrossHint.SECOND_IS_SMALL =>\n    trainingSet.crossWithTiny(inputSplit)\n  case _ => trainingSet.cross(inputSplit)\n}\n\nval crossed = crossTuned.mapPartition {\n  // ...\n}\n\n// ...\n```\n\nWe have to decide the name of added parameter (`SizeHint`) and add documentation of explanation that which dataset is first (training) and which dataset is second (testing).\n\nBy the way, there is no documentation for k-NN.

How the index of a channel maps to an upstream operator is internal to the network layer and dependent on several things, some of which are not even deterministic IMHO. Off the top of my head it should depend on the number of upstream tasks, the parallelism of these upstream tasks and the order in which the system choses to attach the channels.\n\nI think your goal can be achieved by adding a task-id field in the message wrapper and setting this when emitting elements.

For this, you could even have a \"plain/raw\" input stream (eg, `DataStream<String>`) or a POJO. Both can be translated into StormTuple (which is only used for input tuples). Output tuples are of type `Values` and also translated back to `TupleX` type.\n\nExtending the tuples with an additional field would work, too. But I did not like this, because is increases the data that need to be shipped over the network. For embedded mode, we would need to think of a nice \"work around\" for \"plain/raw\" and POJO input streams  -- but this should not be a problem. As there are no globally unique task-ids anyway in embedded mode, it might be even ok not to support this feature...\n\nI personally do not see it as a big (very dangerous) problem in exposing \"input channel index\" to the operators.

It has the advantage that teh main authors are in control of the code. Bugfixes can be applied fast, release can be made frequently (no Apache processes). The core repository stays slim, which makes it easier to maintain.\n- One possible place for the parameter server code would be a repository under https://github.com/project-flink . We can create one and grant you access rights.\n- We can link the parameter server code under http://flink.apache.org/community.html#third-party-packages\n\nWhat we would need to do is split up this code into the SSP part (gets into the Flink code) and the Parameter Server part.
