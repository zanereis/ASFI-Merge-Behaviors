It would have be manually executed right now because you need to have run `npm login` before hand to enter your credentials. I have not found a clean way to make this automated, but if that is a requirement I can probably get it working in an unclean way.</p>\n\n<p>    I published the package with a bogus version number here as an example: <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/storm-multilang-js\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://www.npmjs.com/package/storm-multilang-js</a></p>\n\n<p>    I added a `stormjs` utility to make it easier to call a js spout or bolt from a topology by taking care of some of the boilerplate. I also cleaned up `storm.js` a little bit by adding missing semi-colons and making string quotation consistent.</p>\n\n<p>    I'm unsure about the README.md file for the npm package. Should I add more to it or should it just point to documentation living somewhere else?</p>\n\n<p>    Thank you!</p>\n\n<p>You can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:</p>\n\n<p>    $ git pull <a href=\"https://github.com/mzbyszynski/storm\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/mzbyszynski/storm</a> <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-1992\" title=\"Deploy multilang-javascript code as node package\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-1992\"><del>STORM-1992</del></a>_multilang_js_npm</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1584.patch\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1584.patch</a></p>\n\n<p>To close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch<br/>\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:</p>\n\n<p>    This closes #1584</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>commit afe5e3e4db519ea5877c6e9a7c5b2da668784814<br/>\nAuthor: Marc Zbyszynski <mzbyszynski@xlhybrids.com><br/>\nDate:   2016-07-21T21:55:57Z</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-1992\" title=\"Deploy multilang-javascript code as node package\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-1992\"><del>STORM-1992</del></a> Added artifacts to multilang-javascript to package it as an npm module, and added npmjs profile for deploying the package to npmjs.con</p>\n\n<hr />","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612930236/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/234427853","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1480#issuecomment-234427853","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1480","id":234427853,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNDQyNzg1Mw==","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-22T01:01:22Z","updated_at":"2016-07-22T01:01:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sorry for long delay, say, 1 month.\nI've met similar issue on Storm SQL, so I've initiate discussion to dev@ list.\nAlong with discussion, I'm trying to see how Spark handles dependencies and adding them to executor.
