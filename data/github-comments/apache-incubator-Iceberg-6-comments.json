This would mean streaming out data from all of the files present in the table as well as from new files that arrive after the stream is started.\r\n\r\nThere are some things to think about:\r\n- What should happen if we detect deleted files while we are streaming data out?\r\n- What do we consider as one batch? For example, we will need to stream out data from all of the files present in the table when we start a query. This might be a lot of data, so we need to split it into multiple batches. The split can be based on either the number of files/records or even estimated size.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/491546845/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/491546883","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/179#issuecomment-491546883","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/179","id":491546883,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MTU0Njg4Mw==","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-11T21:57:40Z","updated_at":"2019-05-11T21:57:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@prodeezy would you be interested to work on this?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/491546883/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/491581366","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/61#issuecomment-491581366","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/61","id":491581366,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MTU4MTM2Ng==","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-12T09:54:34Z","updated_at":"2019-05-12T09:54:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks, @rdblue!

The benchmarks in the PR above test vectorized and non-vectorized reads on flat and nested data. On flat data, Iceberg is slightly faster. The real difference is seen on nested data. \r\n\r\nAs I also said in that PR, Iceberg DS is V2 and the file source is still V1, which complicates the comparison. I am working on benchmarks for readers alone without Spark.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/494570064/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/494590000","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/123#issuecomment-494590000","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/123","id":494590000,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NDU5MDAwMA==","user":{"login":"prodeezy","id":1474591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzQ1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1474591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prodeezy","html_url":"https://github.com/prodeezy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prodeezy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prodeezy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prodeezy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prodeezy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prodeezy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prodeezy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prodeezy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prodeezy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prodeezy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-21T23:01:10Z","updated_at":"2019-05-21T23:01:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rdblue gentle reminder.

Instead of storing a list of columns, we can store a regular expression. \r\n\r\nThen we will be able to construct a `MetricsSpec` based on those properties and pass it to writers.\r\n\r\n**Option 2 (Extend Metadata)**\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we can store a `MetricsSpec` directly in the metadata (similar to `PartitionSpec`) and expose an API to update it.
