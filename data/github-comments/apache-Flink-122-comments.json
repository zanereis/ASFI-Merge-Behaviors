This makes it much cleaner and easier to test.\n\nI'm actually wondering whether we can actually take it a step further. What I've noticed is that we have to pass the `TaskExecutor` to different places to have access to the its state and to run things in the main thread context. I'm not sure whether this is really necessary. \n\nThe registration information should be more or less constant and the main thing which has to happen in the main thread context is the setting of the connected gateway. So wouldn't it be possible that the `ResourceManagerRegistration` is something like a cancelable future which is instantiated with all necessary information. It performs the registration logic completely in the background and once it is completed we can create a `TaskExecutorToResourceManagerConnection` in the main thread context. Whenever we have to start a new registration, we cancel the future (if there is still another registration running).\n\nPulling out the `TaskExecutor` from the registration process has the advantage that the components are even further separated and, thus, easier to test.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/240015910/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/240027052","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2374#issuecomment-240027052","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2374","id":240027052,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MDAyNzA1Mg==","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-16T07:41:56Z","updated_at":"2016-08-16T07:41:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I will look at this in more detail later today; but i couldn't find any mistakes skimming over it.

For example, should we really mandate exponentially weighed rate (according to the javadocs), or do we really need the 15 minute rate?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/240240977/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/240246017","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2314#issuecomment-240246017","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2314","id":240246017,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MDI0NjAxNw==","user":{"login":"mushketyk","id":592286,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MjI4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/592286?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk","html_url":"https://github.com/mushketyk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-16T21:32:15Z","updated_at":"2016-08-16T21:32:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rmetzger I've updated the PR according to your review.

Either we make each access a little more expensive (declare the field `volatile`), or we eagerly initialize the maps.\n\nAs a followup, we should probably look into adjusting the JMX reporter.

Thanks for your PR. As Robert and Stephan already pointed out, it contains a lot of reformats which are generally encouraged. They make the pull request's essentials hard to review and can even introduce subtle bugs. \n\nThe prefered way of syncing up with the master is to rebased against the master before you open a pull request:\n\n```\ngit pull --rebase upstream master\n```\n\n`upstream` is the main Flink repository.

It looks good if you think it is not a bit deal that the interface RpcGateway contains functions defined for specific business logic and functions defined for frameworks logic which right now only contains `getAddress`. I treat it some kind of weird because I think the RpcGateway interface is the business logic protocol of a RPC server, just like what we do in hadoop rpc framework which uses a interface to define what can do for a RPC server, similar to the RPC abstraction.\n2. I find that in current AkkaRpcService has another problem that if we use a RpcService to get a Endpoint's self address, but the endpoint is not created by the RpcService, we will get a wrong too, just like the example you make. It need to do some check if we want to keep the function. and your commit solve the problem too.\n3. Sorry for the codes left behind in last revert. I have removed it.  But I think if the concern in 1 is not a problem, your solution is better, and the PR can be discarded\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/240768668/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/240769026","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2315#issuecomment-240769026","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2315","id":240769026,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MDc2OTAyNg==","user":{"login":"EronWright","id":1775518,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzU1MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1775518?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EronWright","html_url":"https://github.com/EronWright","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EronWright/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EronWright/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EronWright/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EronWright/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EronWright/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EronWright/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EronWright/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EronWright/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EronWright/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-18T15:55:45Z","updated_at":"2016-08-18T15:55:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the review @tillrohrmann @mxm and @StephanEwen.

I've gone over the code and made some inline comments. My main concern/question is actually the representation of metric's type and hierarchy information. I think that encoding it in a string and then re-parsing it on the receiver side to reconstruct the information is rather fragile and error-prone especially wrt maintainability. Maybe you can give me some background why you decided to do it so.\n\nApart from that, I think the code contains many tests, which I really like :-)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/240791329/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/240793076","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2355#issuecomment-240793076","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2355","id":240793076,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MDc5MzA3Ng==","user":{"login":"Renkai","id":3381789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzODE3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3381789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renkai","html_url":"https://github.com/Renkai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renkai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renkai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renkai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renkai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renkai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renkai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renkai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renkai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renkai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-18T17:18:09Z","updated_at":"2016-08-18T17:18:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I have rearranged the code.
