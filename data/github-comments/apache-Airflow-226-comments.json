Is there ever a case where the DagRun is not committed to that database immediately?\r\n\r\nIntuitively, it seems likely impossible in actual execution.  But if you are experimenting in interactive console, as you have demonstrated, it is certainly possible. (And I do that sometimes when working out template behavior.)\r\nAnother alternative approach to this would be to leave default value alone, but just add a `get_conf` method on `DagRun`, just like there is now with `get_dag`.  `get_conf` could return an empty dict if there is no conf.\r\nWe could also add a `get_dag_run_conf` method to `TaskInstance`, which would also handle the case when there is no `dag_run`.  Then you could safely do something like \r\n`{{ ti.get_dag_run_conf.get('start_date') or ds }}` in templates.\r\nOr maybe it would make more sense to define it so the method is conf param getter rather than conf getter: e.g. `{{ ti.dag_run_conf_get('start_date') or ds }}`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/491671014/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/491677635","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5263#issuecomment-491677635","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5263","id":491677635,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MTY3NzYzNQ==","user":{"login":"dstandish","id":15932138,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTMyMTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15932138?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish","html_url":"https://github.com/dstandish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-13T05:09:07Z","updated_at":"2019-05-13T05:21:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@yampelo one more idea:\r\nIf the concern here is just templating behavior, we could just add a `dag_run_conf` attribute to the template context, which would be `{}` by default and the conf if one exists.
