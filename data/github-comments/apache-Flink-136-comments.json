That means they exit and restart. Effectively, a JobManager failure results in all TaskManagers restarting.\nThat is a bit heavy.\n\nInstead, we'll adjust this to do the following:\n- TaskManagers must not watch the JobManager via Akka. That way, JobManager failures do not cause any quarantining on the TaskManager side.\n- The JobManager keeps watching the TaskManagers via Akka, so TaskManager failures (false positives) still result in TaskManager quarantine, which means the TaskManager need to restart when a TM-JM link breaks\n\nHow do TaskManagers then detect JobManager failure?\n- TaskManagers send heartbeats to the JobManager anyways (accumulators, in the future task status reconciliation). The TaskManagers use that to detect JobManager failures.\n- In high availability setups, TaskManagers notice JobManager failure also via ZooKeeper\n- In addition, in flip-6 the resource manager tells TaskManagers about JobManager container failures\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/256622125/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/256622283","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2696#issuecomment-256622283","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2696","id":256622283,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NjYyMjI4Mw==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-27T12:03:37Z","updated_at":"2016-10-27T12:03:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This means we should do a separate pull request which changes the TaskManager side of the failure detection from Akka watch to the TaskManager heartbeats.\n\nAfter that is in, we merge this.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/256622283/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/256623928","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2664#issuecomment-256623928","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2664","id":256623928,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NjYyMzkyOA==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-27T12:12:30Z","updated_at":"2016-10-27T12:12:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Subdirectories of `lib` are currently not considered.
