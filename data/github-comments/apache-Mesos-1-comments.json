Some discussion and code can be found here:\nhttps://reviews.apache.org/r/14686\n\nThe goal is slightly different. You want to get rid of those 'dispatch' boilerplate code. My goal is to create a common base class for those libprocess Process wrapper classes so that we don't need to pass raw pointer (or smart pointer) around. It's safe to copy the wrapper class.\n\nLooking at your examples, the following code hurts the readability a bit. We'll be having a lot of 'dispatch' calls in the code base, at which moment, people might be asking why not just use the raw dispatch (i.e., dispatch(process, xxx, args...);) instead?\n\n```\nFuture<size_t> result =                                                          \n  dispatcher->dispatch(                                                          \n    Interface::writeToFile,                                                      \n    data);\n```\n\nIf would be cool if we can do the following directly.
