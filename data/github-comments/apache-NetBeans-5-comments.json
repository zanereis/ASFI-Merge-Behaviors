Javier,\n\nI didn’t know about that.  Is this something committers do? Or something I was meant to do as a contributor?  \n\nI mis-spoke in my prior comment, what I was concerned about was squashing a conflict merge, i.e. the additional commits are to do with sorting out the conflict with base (I don’t know why GitHub made me do 2 commits.  I read somewhere git can get confused with how it tracks conflicts if you mess around with squashing.\n\nIs there something else I can do to finish this as a contributor?\n\nCheers\nRoss\n\n> On 27 Oct 2017, at 5:40 am, Javier A.
