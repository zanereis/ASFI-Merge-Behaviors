For example, I run REST locally in Intellij and debugging works fine against the in memory components or full dev.  I think the Storm topologies should continue to be run locally with LocalCluster so we're covered there too as along as the topologies can access the services running in Docker.  The only difference I can think of would be that now you can't put a breakpoint in Kafka or Elasticsearch server side code without enabling remote debugging.\r\n\r\nI have no problem with this being a feature branch.  There is a lot of work to be done and design issues to work through.  The tradeoff of having this in a feature branch is that it will delay the ability to run the UI e2e tests in our build.  The tradeoff of doing it incrementally is that our build times will increase until we switch the tests over because we will have to use both in memory components and Docker.

From what I can tell, we do this via blueprint when we install full-dev from a setting in single_node_vm.yml\r\n\r\n```\r\n  - metron-rest-env:\r\n      metron_spring_profiles_active: \"dev\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm wondering if we can/should configure this same setting in small_cluster.yml, which is used by the Amazon EC2 deployment. Any thoughts on this? At the very least I think this PR should include a doc change to indicate that we aren't setting up users unless you explicitly set a profile via Ambari or create them manually as a separate task.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/350146512/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/350253641","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/861#issuecomment-350253641","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/861","id":350253641,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MDI1MzY0MQ==","user":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-08T12:38:28Z","updated_at":"2017-12-08T12:38:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I trying to run this up in full dev.

Currently on the Swagger UI we see that API '/api/v1/user' is listed with all the Request methods. After this fix we will see it will be listed for only GET request method. I verified by building the full dev with this change.

We upped the versions of Node to 9.2.1. Per the doc, >8 is required to work with async/await. For good measure, I also set the NPM version to 5.6.0. We didn't touch Jasmine, but the Protractor docs also state that it should be > 2.7. Looks like we are currently using 2.5.2 per the package.json file. We may want to consider increasing that version as well.\r\n\r\nWe added `SELENIUM_PROMISE_MANAGER: false` to `protractor.conf.js` and immediately got failures due to `Promise` use in the Protractor tests and configuration. e.g. `var defer = protractor.promise.defer();`. So we removed references to promises in the conf file and were able to get past that first batch of errors. Now we were into problems with the tests. I started with the `login.e2e-spec.ts` spec file and removed `: Promise<any>`. Running the tests again, the login tests were able to succeed.\r\n\r\nThere are still a large number of failures due to disabling the promise manager, but still having code throughout the test suite that leverages the older style.
