The input is an event stream from Kafka and we write to output to S3.\r\nMy guess is that we might be loosing spark executors before Hudi finalise the writing of the .commit file and therefore it is empty, but its just a speculation, i didn't saw this scenario in the logs or metrics.. \r\nAnother options is something to do with S3  eventual consistency, we are using
