In fact, I suggested you create discussion thread. And you seems you did. great job :smiley: \n\n> At the moment, this PR has zero adoption. You made a major change in its architecture a day ago that no-one has had a chance to try out.\n\nAdoption is not a requirement of code contribution. Most code contribution merges with 0 adoption.\n\n> And it has zero tests --- because the CI issue still isn't solved, they've been replaced by tests that don't cover the PRs functionality and don't even test if it can connect to R or Spark. \n\nThis PR includes an integration test which verifies Zeppelin - RInterpreter - R - Spark cluster connection.\nWhile CI is not green, i hope @echarles can trigger it again and see if it's passing.\n\n> This is absolutely the opposite of the consensus the community has repeatedly reached about the R issue.\n> Will you be abiding by the community's consensus or do we really need to start a seventh discussion about this on the mailing list?\n\nI think this PR is not against community consensus.

Two files are flagged as requiring an Apache license header --- these are files where you had undertaken to determine where we should put the license, because we agreed that a header is not appropriate.   That is your action item, and its been outstanding for six weeks. \n2.  PySpark fails its integration tests with Spark.  The version of this PR on my repo contains a very small change to PySpark, to get the spark home correctly.  The version here never touches PySpark. \n\nI have not been able to replicate the problem you cut-and-pasted, in any environment, from either PR version.\n\nIf you click the Travis link just above, you will see that its green except for 1.6 and 1.2.2.  It does _not_ appear to produce the error you cut and pasted.\n\n---\n\nI am certainly sympathetic to the fact that we all have day jobs and families.\n\nIn this case, working on Zeppelin _is_ your day job -- you're an NFlabs employee.  Since you were an early author, one would presume that you also have a personal financial interest in it.  NFLabs submitted this project to Apache for commercial reasons. \n\nThis has been outstanding since August.  When you undertook to work on this, we got off to quite a good start, and I was very optimistic. \n\nAt this point, so far, it appears that what you have done is ask me _four times_ to repeatedly list the PR's R package dependencies -- which you never even used. \n\nI'm sure you could see why, at this point, I would have serious doubts about whether your engagement has been bona fide at all. \n\nP.S.:  If you think I don't understand java build, I'm sure you will be happy to identify each and every error I've made.  \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/202220759/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/202223003","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/208#issuecomment-202223003","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/208","id":202223003,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwMjIyMzAwMw==","user":{"login":"elbamos","id":10103420,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTAzNDIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10103420?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbamos","html_url":"https://github.com/elbamos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbamos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbamos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbamos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbamos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbamos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbamos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbamos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbamos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbamos/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-28T04:01:42Z","updated_at":"2016-03-28T04:01:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bzz Let me just add, to avoid any doubt --- I hope I'm wrong.

reviewing the other InterpreterTest files, I find that none utilize a test where the output '.contains' a specific string.  That specific test in Ignite is supposed to be testing for weather the interpreter is 'live' and can handle some basic commands which is verified by the assertion in the test.  While it _should_ compile and regularly does. It seems to be consistently failing on one specific configuration, which leads me to believe the failure has more to do with the configuration than anything else.  \n\nPersonally I would recommend dropping the line:\n`assertTrue(result.message().contains(sizeVal + \": Int = \" + ignite.cluster().nodes().size()));`\nwhich is the line of failure in the Hadoop 1.6.0 builds, e.g. the hangup.  The line preceding the proposed drop line asserts that the line is successfully executed.  E.g. `val \" + sizeVal + \" = ignite.cluster().nodes().size()` does successfully execute. The test that is causing failure is that what ever is returned by that line is not what one would expect. Again, ignite is the only interpreter to run this sort of test.  \n\nThe ability to handle companion objects for all Ignite users seems more important than a possibly unexpected number of nodes reported in a very specific build of Hadoop. \n\nJust my .02. \n\nI have no problem resetting the Ignite files.

Yes, I believe licenses for each contributed file are clear now, but what I was asking you for is just to follow each [please clarify]() link from the https://github.com/apache/incubator-zeppelin/pull/208#issuecomment-203673589 where I have posted a question for you about modification\\licences and post your ansewers there.\n\nIt may look like a formality from the first sight, but from my experience such things will allow us to keep history of this important conversation and it will simplify the review for those, who are interested to follow it. Would that be something you are willing to do? Thank you in advance.\n\nAlso please mind, as this is a first changeset that includes so many files from different places contributed to project codebase, I have also asked IPMC to verify the correctness of our interpretation of the legal aspect, so please be patient, we are almost there, I would expect it will take no more than a day or two to advise on this matter. \n\nMeanwhile I will be looking into [ZEPPELIN-776](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-776) - as discussed, my personal oppinion is that it does not block this work now, but it would be very sweet project improvement if could be nailed down.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/203749879/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
