I miss something. so maybe this is considered. That is I don't see `unwrap_modules`. I ask this because I think it is related with our next module based interface runtime. The usage like [this](https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/pull/5753/files#diff-82bcc5ddf3cb06075848655807dfcbd5R136-R157):\r\n```python\r\nwith relay.build_config(opt_level=3):\r\n    complied_graph_lib = relay.build_module.build(\r\n        mod, \"llvm\", params=params)\r\n\r\nfrom tvm.contrib import util\r\ntemp = util.tempdir()\r\nfile_name = \"deploy_lib.so\"\r\npath_lib = temp.relpath(file_name)\r\ncomplied_graph_lib.export_library(path_lib)\r\nloaded_lib = tvm.runtime.load_module(path_lib)\r\nctx = tvm.cpu(0)\r\ngmod = loaded_lib['default'](ctx)\r\nset_input = gmod[\"set_input\"]\r\nrun = gmod[\"run\"]\r\nget_output = gmod[\"get_output\"]\r\ndata = np.random.uniform(-1, 1, size=(1, 3, 224, 224)).astype(\"float32\")\r\nset_input(\"data\", tvm.nd.array(data))\r\nrun()\r\nout = get_output(0).asnumpy()\r\n```\r\nAs you could see we will wrap `params` / `lib` / `json` into one lib.
