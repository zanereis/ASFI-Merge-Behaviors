asap.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/277005134/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/277011340","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2050#issuecomment-277011340","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2050","id":277011340,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NzAxMTM0MA==","user":{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-02T16:43:37Z","updated_at":"2017-02-02T16:43:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Lgtm","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/277011340/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/277011646","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2013#issuecomment-277011646","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2013","id":277011646,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NzAxMTY0Ng==","user":{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-02T16:44:37Z","updated_at":"2017-02-02T16:44:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jlowin

When thinking about \"data flow\" or \"a data driven dependency engine\" I think each committer and user might have very different mental model on how this should/could work ideally. For example, my original set of ideas were pretty different, but not better by any mean, just different, and I feel like we should get a good consensus on design before moving forward with a feature this foundational.\r\n\r\nIn any case, this is a really good way to start the conversation! Here are a few related thoughts:\r\n* your implementation seems more about standardizing how tasks pass data to one another more than about having a data-driven dependency engine (which I think was a key element in the original discussion). The dataflow interface might need a `dataflow_exists(task_instance)` for the scheduler to use, though I have mixed feelings about mixing task and data-dependencies...\r\n* I'm open to the idea of doing something similar to `XComs` for data payload as it can be useful in some cases to pass data across tasks in a standard way, though I'd advise most people to avoid this pattern in most cases since it's assuming data transformations in single-threaded Python in a non-streaming kind of way. Heavy lifting should be done out of Airflow, in Spark or Hive, some MPP database or whatever, but I get the use case for small data, \"just glue things together\" \r\n* Could the ideas behind the `Dataflow` abstraction be implemented as an interface that some hooks could implement since hooks already deal with authentication and connectivity to external systems? Say the S3Hook could implement the 3-4 methods and become \"Dataflow compliant\", meaning you could specify a `dataflow_conn_id` as a target and use a key that's directly related to the task instance\r\n* If the source / sink supports streaming, could set/get be implemented as generators? It's pretty common to want to process an amount of data that may not fit in memory on the worker slot.

I also like the third point about making the IO part of passing data down the DAG tied to the connection hook logic to take advantage of the connection system already built into Airflow. \r\n\r\nI disagree with the second point in the sense that I think there's a number of people (based on hearing from them re: our dataflow-esque workaround fileflow) who primarily want to use Airflow workers as a single threaded data processing system for a pipeline of smaller streaming or non-streaming tasks, my own use case included. For us and possibly for them, the other solutions built more expressly for that purpose were missing a lot in the monitoring and reportability feature space so we couldn't guarantee the SLAs we wanted, but we didn't want to/were not at a data size yet to warrant investing in the heavy lifting technologies like Spark.\r\n\r\nGiven that, it may become a question of as to what paradigms of workflows Airflow is intending to address, or at least in how standard/batteries-included of a way. If, by way of providing this system to pass data down the DAG, Airflow would be implicitly supporting processing bigger result sets than workers might be provisioned to do, the slippery slope of point four becomes an issue. However since I'm already drinking the kool-aid of doing data processing inside Airflow workers, I'm a fan of building the \"dataflow compliant\" hooks (or wherever the IO lives) in a way to support streaming IO to protect against worker hardware variability in the wild.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/278722340/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/278757183","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2061#issuecomment-278757183","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2061","id":278757183,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3ODc1NzE4Mw==","user":{"login":"r39132","id":581734,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MTczNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/581734?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132","html_url":"https://github.com/r39132","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-09T20:06:47Z","updated_at":"2017-02-09T20:06:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Welcome @vitorbaptista !","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/278757183/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/278758173","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2059#issuecomment-278758173","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2059","id":278758173,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3ODc1ODE3Mw==","user":{"login":"r39132","id":581734,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MTczNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/581734?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132","html_url":"https://github.com/r39132","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-09T20:10:16Z","updated_at":"2017-02-09T20:10:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thx for the contribution..

You may want to fix those if they persist.\r\n\r\nhttps://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Contributors%27+Guide","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/278758173/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/278825050","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2062#issuecomment-278825050","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2062","id":278825050,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3ODgyNTA1MA==","user":{"login":"aoen","id":1592778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTI3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1592778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoen","html_url":"https://github.com/aoen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-10T00:50:56Z","updated_at":"2017-02-10T00:51:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM (and thanks for helping with code quality)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/278825050/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/278922315","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2065#issuecomment-278922315","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2065","id":278922315,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3ODkyMjMxNQ==","user":{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-10T11:34:18Z","updated_at":"2017-02-10T11:34:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Please close this.

On that, please note that the way Zendesk's APIs multi-page end-points return responses is different for their Core API and Incremental Export API. For Core, they simply set the next_page to null so that you don't make additional calls (and this is well handled in the zdesk client), for incremental export api, the next_page in the last page of the result set is set to a url which you are supposed to save and start getting the results from that point onwards (next time you run your fetch).
