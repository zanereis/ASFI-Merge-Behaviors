stephen\n\nmany thanks for the feedbacks. correct me if i'm wrong, the main question you asked is why there are n different models even using synchronized training, e.g. `dist_sync`.\n\nthe answer is that all parameters expect for the batch normalization layer should be identical. the problem for the batch normalization is that it maintains a guess of the mean and variance of the gradient, which is correlated to the local data that node seem. we didn't do a synchronization between nodes to average their values during training. \n\nas a results, we have several different models at the end even for `dist_sync`. we can either pick one of them, or do a model average. we will be very appreciated if you have a better

you for your very speedy response. However, I suggest we try to make the situation better. I assume that my high level understanding of how the dist-sync process works is essentially correct, given that you made no corrections, so I'm continuing with this in mind.\n1. Your response suggests that the user deploy an ensemble if they trained with a distributed net (perhaps only in the case if batch norm was used in the model design??). Thus if they trained over 28 nodes, e.g., you are recommending they deploy an ensemble of 28 models, so they can average the predictions of each? And thus, the more nodes they use in training, the worse the deployment to a run-time application becomes? As I stated in my original post, the mechanisms by which we train the model would ideally not effect the deployment/usage/interpretation of that model. I suppose we could always advise the user to simply pick the final model with the highest validation score, but then why not automate this to produce the final model?\n2. If you know that the batch norm layer will create extra effort/issues on behalf of the users, I suggest that this should be pointed out clearly in the documentation and tutorials. I suggest the distributed training docs/tutorials should not end at: \"yay! It ran to completion!\", but rather: \"now that training is completed, here's how we deploy the model to perform prediction on new images\".\n3. Why not allow the batch norm params to be synchronized, at least as an option? The normalization would be better, it would seem, if it were generalized across the entire training set by communicating each node's normalization stats to the PS and then aggregating and updating.\n4. Even if the above is not advisable, how about at the very end of the process, we aggregate the batch norm values for use in the final model for run-time prediction? After all, the idea is to use statistics over the entire training corpus as an estimate to help us center new/unseen data. The more data the normalization stats are derived from, the better it should generalize. (I guess this simply restates the previous point, but makes the concession that maybe we aggregate the BN stats only at the very end, if for some reason, that's much preferred for accuracy or speed reasons.)\n5. Finally, I interpret your answer that if I had no batch-norm in my deep net design, then I should observe identical validation scores at each epoch in the distributed training, and that my K final models would in fact be identical, so picking any one as the final model would suffice. (I will test this and see if this assertion holds).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/179548312/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/179552555","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/1412#issuecomment-179552555","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1412","id":179552555,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3OTU1MjU1NQ==","user":{"login":"piiswrong","id":568948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODk0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong","html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-04T00:39:23Z","updated_at":"2016-02-04T00:39:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Bilinear upsampling is implemented via convolution, therefore the weights.

You can see that each of the 3 nodes reports different validation accuracy at each epoch. This output still contradicts my expectations, but it may be explained if the validation scores are computed prior to synchronization (which I feel is a mistake, but perhaps there are implementation reasons why this is best).\n\n```\n[16:14:22] src/io/./iter_normalize.h:103: Load mean image from s3://sandbox-svo/datasets/cifar/data/mean.bin\n[16:14:22] src/io/./iter_normalize.h:103: Load mean image from s3://sandbox-svo/datasets/cifar/data/mean.bin\n2016-02-04 16:14:23,146 Node[2] Start training with [gpu(0)]\n2016-02-04 16:14:23,247 Node[0] Start training with [gpu(0)]\n[16:14:23] src/io/./iter_normalize.h:103: Load mean image from s3://sandbox-svo/datasets/cifar/data/mean.bin\n2016-02-04 16:14:23,374 Node[1] Start training with [gpu(0)]\n2016-02-04 16:14:27,286 Node[1] Epoch[0] Batch [50] Speed: 5842.33 samples/sec  Train-accuracy=0.302500\n2016-02-04 16:14:27,364 Node[0] Epoch[0] Batch [50] Speed: 5774.41 samples/sec  Train-accuracy=0.290781\n2016-02-04 16:14:27,384 Node[2] Epoch[0] Batch [50] Speed: 5633.65 samples/sec  Train-accuracy=0.303594\n2016-02-04 16:14:28,417 Node[0] Epoch[0] Batch [100]    Speed: 6075.84 samples/sec  Train-accuracy=0.335859\n2016-02-04 16:14:28,438 Node[2] Epoch[0] Batch [100]    Speed: 6076.09 samples/sec  Train-accuracy=0.330078\n2016-02-04 16:14:28,340 Node[1] Epoch[0] Batch [100]    Speed: 6073.98 samples/sec  Train-accuracy=0.339922\n2016-02-04 16:14:29,816 Node[1] Epoch[0] Batch [150]    Speed: 4336.60 samples/sec  Train-accuracy=0.366406\n2016-02-04 16:14:29,896 Node[0] Epoch[0] Batch [150]    Speed: 4328.20 samples/sec  Train-accuracy=0.363698\n2016-02-04 16:14:29,917 Node[2] Epoch[0] Batch [150]    Speed: 4327.61 samples/sec  Train-accuracy=0.359010\n2016-02-04 16:14:29,977 Node[1] Epoch[0] Train-accuracy=0.368339\n2016-02-04 16:14:29,978 Node[1] Epoch[0] Time cost=4.133\n2016-02-04 16:14:30,078 Node[2] Epoch[0] Train-accuracy=0.362179\n2016-02-04 16:14:30,078 Node[2] Epoch[0] Time cost=4.142\n2016-02-04 16:14:30,058 Node[0] Epoch[0] Train-accuracy=0.365685\n2016-02-04 16:14:30,058 Node[0] Epoch[0] Time cost=4.143\n2016-02-04 16:14:30,764 Node[0] Epoch[0] Validation-accuracy=0.438657\n2016-02-04 16:14:30,729 Node[1] Epoch[0] Validation-accuracy=0.436921\n2016-02-04 16:14:30,915 Node[2] Epoch[0] Validation-accuracy=0.422776\n2016-02-04 16:14:31,047 Node[0] Saved checkpoint to \"s3://sandbox-svo/datasets/cifar/models/cifar10_lenet-0-0001.params\"\n2016-02-04 16:14:31,068 Node[1] Saved checkpoint to \"s3://sandbox-svo/datasets/cifar/models/cifar10_lenet-1-0001.params\"\n2016-02-04 16:14:31,226 Node[2] Saved checkpoint to \"s3://sandbox-svo/datasets/cifar/models/cifar10_lenet-2-0001.params\"\n2016-02-04 16:14:32,651 Node[0] Epoch[1] Batch [50] Speed: 5146.04 samples/sec  Train-accuracy=0.435937\n2016-02-04 16:14:32,671 Node[2] Epoch[1] Batch [50] Speed: 6033.58 samples/sec  Train-accuracy=0.426875\n2016-02-04 16:14:32,574 Node[1] Epoch[1] Batch [50] Speed: 5467.13 samples/sec  Train-accuracy=0.442031\n2016-02-04 16:14:33,723 Node[2] Epoch[1] Batch [100]    Speed: 6084.47 samples/sec  Train-accuracy=0.434141\n2016-02-04 16:14:33,626 Node[1] Epoch[1] Batch [100]    Speed: 6084.57 samples/sec  Train-accuracy=0.444609\n2016-02-04 16:14:33,703 Node[0] Epoch[1] Batch [100]    Speed: 6083.52 samples/sec  Train-accuracy=0.443594\n2016-02-04 16:14:35,067 Node[1] Epoch[1] Batch [150]    Speed: 4441.59 samples/sec  Train-accuracy=0.452448\n2016-02-04 16:14:35,146 Node[0] Epoch[1] Batch [150]    Speed: 4435.86 samples/sec  Train-accuracy=0.447865\n2016-02-04 16:14:35,168 Node[2] Epoch[1] Batch [150]    Speed: 4432.12 samples/sec  Train-accuracy=0.445156\n2016-02-04 16:14:35,228 Node[1] Epoch[1] Train-accuracy=0.454026\n2016-02-04 16:14:35,228 Node[1] Epoch[1] Time cost=4.159\n2016-02-04 16:14:35,328 Node[2] Epoch[1] Train-accuracy=0.447917\n2016-02-04 16:14:35,328 Node[2] Epoch[1] Time cost=4.102\n2016-02-04 16:14:35,308 Node[0] Epoch[1] Train-accuracy=0.448768\n2016-02-04 16:14:35,308 Node[0] Epoch[1] Time cost=4.261\n2016-02-04 16:14:35,617 Node[1] Epoch[1] Validation-accuracy=0.499399\n2016-02-04 16:14:35,718 Node[0] Epoch[1] Validation-accuracy=0.490685\n2016-02-04 16:14:35,799 Node[2] Epoch[1] Validation-accuracy=0.477464\n2016-02-04 16:14:35,855 Node[1] Saved checkpoint to \"s3://sandbox-svo/datasets/cifar/models/cifar10_lenet-1-0002.params\"\n2016-02-04 16:14:35,966 Node[0] Saved checkpoint to \"s3://sandbox-svo/datasets/cifar/models/cifar10_lenet-0-0002.params\"\n2016-02-04 16:14:36,387 Node[2] Saved checkpoint to \"s3://sandbox-svo/datasets/cifar/models/cifar10_lenet-2-0002.params\"\n```\n\n> > Follow up to my original observation 2 -- k final models are different\n\nAfter the training using LeNet completed, I tested each of the three saved models on the validation data and confirmed that they do produce the exact same output, so the final models are identical. Thus the usage of batch norm is indeed the culprit for my earlier observation, and with no batch norm, all is well.\n\n> > Follow up to discussion on synchronizing batch norm\n\nWhen we load the params file, there are \"arg params\" and \"aux params\". I believe the batch norm parameters are found in the \"aux params\", correct? Is it a true statement that any aux_params will NOT be synchronized by the parameter server, and thus will cause differences between the distributed models during the training process?\n\n@tqchen, why not synchronize the batch norm variables during training? The paper that introduced the batch norm procedure didn't discuss what to do in the case of distributed training, but it would seem that if we shared the parameters during learning across the nodes that we'd have a better estimate at each learning stage from which to center the data. Since we are using data parallelism, and each of k nodes only sees 1/k of the data, especially when k is large, wouldn't we need to share the data statistics across the nodes in order to not have poorly estimated values at some of the nodes?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/179942554/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/179952130","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/1401#issuecomment-179952130","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1401","id":179952130,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3OTk1MjEzMA==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-04T17:14:01Z","updated_at":"2016-02-04T17:14:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The problem is delete invokes an destructor, which cannot throw exception out.
