The documentation is correct, however, it leaves out that due to limitations in GitHub actions it will not work from PR's from a forked repo. This is because github actions does not pass secrets to workflows originating from a forked repository to prevent leaking secret. But this means the SONAR_TOKEN secret that is required cannot be passed to the scan. So until SonarCloud comes up with alternative that does not require a secret token, we cannot allow scans on PRs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/1894256227/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/1894341904","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/1146#issuecomment-1894341904","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/1146","id":1894341904,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhBG1s5w6V0Q","user":{"login":"tuxji","id":5915561,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MTU1NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5915561?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuxji","html_url":"https://github.com/tuxji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuxji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuxji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuxji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuxji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuxji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuxji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuxji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuxji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuxji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-16T19:00:49Z","updated_at":"2024-01-16T19:00:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I suggest you approve too and merge, Steve, since this is really a version bump anyway.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/1894341904/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/1901304855","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/1149#issuecomment-1901304855","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/1149","id":1901304855,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhBG1s5xU5wX","user":{"login":"mbeckerle","id":1524099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1524099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle","html_url":"https://github.com/mbeckerle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-19T23:40:17Z","updated_at":"2024-01-19T23:40:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I believe this now addresses all the comments by @stevedlawrence.\r\n\r\nNeeds a second reviewer. @jadams-tresys can you review this?

Our tests to fix this detected this, but SBT didn't actually fix the issue permanently--if we update to a newer version of jline that is incompatible the issue could come back. \r\n\r\nThink we have two options:\r\n1) Keep everything the same, but remove/comment out the `test_CLI_Debugger_sbt_jline_broken` test. We will no longer have a test to detect if SBT actually fixes the underlying issue. But our other CLI debugger tests will still fork and should never be affected by an SBT jline incompatibility. But because they fork, they may be a bit slower to run.\r\n2) Move our debugger tests back to the `daffodil-cli` project and remove the forking aspect, reverting to what we had before the incompatibility. Tests will likely run a bit faster, but a future jline update that is incompatible with the version SBT ships with could cause tests to fail and we will have to move everything back to `daffodil-test-integration` and configure them to fork again.\r\n\r\nThoughts?

There's also merge conflicts and a potential licensing issue to figure out. So it might be best to push to the next release. Were thinking we might try to get 3.8.0 out quicker than usual with the new layer API.

(around March 20 & 22).  When the CI workflow ran \"brew install libmxml\" to install the header file and library, it picked up the newly released 4.0.2 version:\r\n\r\n```log\r\nRun brew install libmxml\r\n==> Downloading https://ghcr.io/v2/homebrew/core/libmxml/manifests/4.0.2\r\n==> Fetching libmxml\r\n==> Downloading https://ghcr.io/v2/homebrew/core/libmxml/blobs/sha256:98e1e1b8b65b2cabd74cd88dc9c6bc7c20b702729047bc80bb90a692ae8d4357\r\n==> Pouring libmxml--4.0.2.monterey.bottle.tar.gz\r\n🍺  /usr/local/Cellar/libmxml/4.0.2: 19 files, 1.8MB\r\n```\r\n\r\nI checked the mxml git repository and mxml.h is still there (it hasn't been renamed or moved).  I'm not sure what's going on (@pkatlic  may be able to find out more with his MacBook), but the quickest fix would be to change the workflow to install a previous version of mxml (v3.3.1 was the last version before v4.0 was released).  The Linux build also pins mxml to 3.x because it runs on Ubuntu 22.04, which doesn't roll packages to new versions (only adds security patches as needed).

But this skips all sbt commands for the subproject, not just `sbt test`, so all sbt commands (such as scalafmt) must be run specifically on that project with `sbt daffodil-test-integration/<command>`. Our CI does this when compile, run tests, and check scala formatting.

We should not, in my view, ever convert CR to LF. We should preserve it. I think we could do better than to convert it to the PUA though. \r\n\r\nSee last comment on [DAFFODIL-1559](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DAFFODIL-1559). I think we could map CRLF to U+202B + LF, and isolated CR to NEL(U+2028), and back for unparsing. This would be more palatable for such data as the data would not look polluted by wierd glyphs that get assigned to the PUA characters. \r\n\r\nNo matter what we need to supply several variations here, so we need to settle on the scheme for how users parameterize the InfosetOutputters and Inputters needs to be agreed upon. The default scheme needs to be exactly what we do today. Maybe Daffodil v4.0.0 can change the default behavior for XML mappings.

Interesting idea to have more complex but more human friendly mappings. It does potentially cause issues with validation since changing the mapping requires different validation pattern facets and thus a different schema.

This change only made it so XercesValidator's are shared between DataProcessor ,custom validators have always been shared. For example, if you did something like this:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval validator = Validators.get(\"MyCustomValidator\").make()\r\nval dp1 = dp.withValidationMode(ValidationMode.Custom(validator))\r\nval dp2 = dp1.withTunable(...)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen both `dp1` and `dp2` would use the same custom validator.

I was able to dump the serialized processors to text (using [NickstaDB/SerializationDumper](https://github.com/NickstaDB/SerializationDumper)) and do a diff, and found the only difference in both cases was this:\r\n```diff\r\n  delimiters\r\n    (array)\r\n-     TC_ARRAY - 0x75\r\n-       TC_REFERENCE - 0x71\r\n-         Handle - 8258633 - 0x00 7e 04 49\r\n-       newHandle 0x00 7e 04 c6\r\n-       Array size - 0 - 0x00 00 00 00\r\n-       Values\r\n+     TC_REFERENCE - 0x71\r\n+       Handle - 8258634 - 0x00 7e 04 4a\r\n```\r\nThe `delimiters` member is the `Array[DelimiterParseEv]` in the `DelimiterStackParser`. I'm not 100% sure how to interpret this, but I think in the first case the delimier array is a uniquely allocated zero-length array, where the reference is to the type (i.e. the class description for `DelimiterParseEv)`. In the second case, it just points to an already existing array zero-length array. So in one case the zero-length array is shared, in the other it's not. So functionally exactly the same, just one has extra allocations.\r\n\r\nI wonder if maybe there is some optimization somewhere something detects zero-length arrays and can share them instead of allocating new arrays?
