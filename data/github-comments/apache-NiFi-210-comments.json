Let's keep the convo here instead of JIRA to be in one place.\r\n\r\nSo the controller service uses com.google.auth:google-auth-library-oauth2-http which has a bunch of dependencies.\r\n\r\nYou wanted to exclude all those in the nifi-gcp-nar so they're not duplicated.  You added two more that were not part of the dependency chain of com.google.auth:google-auth-library-oauth2-http such as 'grpc-core' and 'grpc-util' because you discovered that 'grpc-api' has a reflective dependency on these libraries (which is wild).  However, since it is loaded via reflection the classloader should be the child classloader and it seems to be should not be necessary to move them up to the top area.  \r\n\r\nDid it fail for you otherwise or you chose to keep them together for consistency?  I ask because if you look in the nifi-gcp-nar dependency tree there are many other 'io.grpc' dependencies that we do allow to remain in that child nar.\r\n\r\nThis is a long winded way of saying I get why you're excluding all the items in the nifi-gcp-nar.

My concern is just to ensure we do the minimal pom magic and let the dependency management do its work as best we can.

Thanks!\r\n\r\nThanks for the reply @JackHintonSmartDCSIT.\r\n\r\nFlowFile content in a NiFi queue does not use heap memory, and instead uses a persistent repository. This allows NiFi to process very large files with relatively small amounts of memory in many cases. The vast majority of NiFi processors do not read the entire FlowFile content into memory, and those that do are more exceptional cases.\r\n\r\nThe `SplitRecord` Processors is one example of a Processor that reads an InputStream, consisting of an unknown number of Records, and then writes a segmented number of Records to one or more output FlowFiles.

methods.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2136240955/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2137298095","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/8884#issuecomment-2137298095","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/8884","id":2137298095,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5_ZJSv","user":{"login":"mcgilman","id":123395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzM5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman","html_url":"https://github.com/mcgilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-29T12:30:42Z","updated_at":"2024-05-29T12:30:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Reviewing...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2137298095/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2137363552","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/8885#issuecomment-2137363552","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/8885","id":2137363552,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5_ZZRg","user":{"login":"mcgilman","id":123395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzM5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman","html_url":"https://github.com/mcgilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-29T13:02:22Z","updated_at":"2024-05-29T13:02:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Reviewing...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2137363552/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2137473601","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/8888#issuecomment-2137473601","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/8888","id":2137473601,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5_Z0JB","user":{"login":"briansolo1985","id":6793849,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3OTM4NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6793849?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/briansolo1985","html_url":"https://github.com/briansolo1985","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briansolo1985/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briansolo1985/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briansolo1985/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briansolo1985/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briansolo1985/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briansolo1985/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briansolo1985/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briansolo1985/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briansolo1985/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-29T13:52:59Z","updated_at":"2024-05-29T13:52:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks

Some of the other Split Processors follow a similar pattern.\r\n> \r\n> Based on the code as it stands, it looks like it will be necessary to refactor the PCAP reading to emit a stream of packets. The `java.util.Iterator` interface is one general way to model this strategy, but the details depend on consuming bytes from an InputStream, then writing packets to a FlowFile OutputStream, which avoids retaining a large number of objects in memory. I realize this will take some work to refactor, but reviewing some of the existing Split Processors should provide some helpful background examples.\r\n\r\nI've been looking through the codebase and I can't find any instances where OutputStream is used without either an OutputStreamCallback (and thus is seemingly incompatible with InputStreamCallback as used in SplitRecord) or a RecordWriter (which needs a schema and a controller service). Is writing a controller service required in order to follow this pattern, or is there an example of another approach somewhere I've missed?\r\n\r\nAlso, in SplitRecord the 'splits' array is used to hold the data processed within the InputStreamCallback that splits the original record, but the individual 'split' records aren't returned by the callback (just appended to the 'splits' array whilst the callback is running). Does that mean that the callback itself is synchronous, or does something in OutputStream handle blocking to ensure there aren't issues with race conditions?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2144852942/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2145237159","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/8906#issuecomment-2145237159","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/8906","id":2145237159,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5_3bin","user":{"login":"EndzeitBegins","id":16666115,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjY2MTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16666115?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndzeitBegins","html_url":"https://github.com/EndzeitBegins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndzeitBegins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndzeitBegins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndzeitBegins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndzeitBegins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndzeitBegins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndzeitBegins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndzeitBegins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndzeitBegins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndzeitBegins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-03T13:41:22Z","updated_at":"2024-06-03T13:41:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"As far as I remember Angular recommends to use \"HTML5 style\" routing for several years already, here's an exempt [from the documentation](https://angular.dev/guide/routing/common-router-tasks#choosing-a-routing-strategy):\r\n> Almost all Angular projects should use the default HTML5 style. It produces URLs that are easier for users to understand and it preserves the option to do server-side rendering.\r\n\r\nTo my knowledge to get this to work properly, one has to set the `baseHref` accordingly when serving the `index.html` .\r\nThis does not have to be done at build time, but can be achieved during runtime as well.\r\n\r\nOne idea is to use a placeholder as `baseHref` and replace it whenever the `index.html` is served. An example of this approach is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/mpalourdio/SpringBootAngularHTML5). There might be other approaches of course.\r\n\r\nI think we should evaluate whether it makes sense to look into this now instead of at a later point in time. \r\nI think changing the approach later might prove to be more difficult as it basically invalides any hash-based links saved by users (or they have to be mapped, requiring a long-time workaround).\r\n\r\nAlso this may avoid the need for a redirect regarding the mapping.\r\n\r\nInterested in your thoughts on this.

If you have the changes required for the 1.x branch, I would go ahead and push them to this branch.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2145350760/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2145375919","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/8903#issuecomment-2145375919","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/8903","id":2145375919,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5_39av","user":{"login":"dan-s1","id":8440116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NDAxMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8440116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1","html_url":"https://github.com/dan-s1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-03T14:39:02Z","updated_at":"2024-06-03T14:39:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@exceptionfactory I just thought a review of ~300 files may be too big for one review.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2145375919/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2145386908","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/8903#issuecomment-2145386908","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/8903","id":2145386908,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5_4AGc","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-03T14:43:36Z","updated_at":"2024-06-03T14:43:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @exceptionfactory I just thought a review of ~300 files may be too big for one review.\r\n\r\nI see, thanks for the consideration.

In my experience there is too much coordination between the front and back end to use PathLocationStrategy with dynamic context paths.

Is writing a controller service required in order to follow this pattern, or is there an example of another approach somewhere I've missed?\r\n\r\nWriting a Controller Service is not required. The `StreamCallback` interface provides access to both an `InputStream` and `OutputStream`, which should support a stream-based solution without excessive buffering in memory.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> Also, in SplitRecord the 'splits' array is used to hold the data processed within the InputStreamCallback that splits the original record, but the individual 'split' records aren't returned by the callback (just appended to the 'splits' array whilst the callback is running). Does that mean that the callback itself is synchronous, or does something in OutputStream handle blocking to ensure there aren't issues with race conditions?\r\n\r\nThe callback is synchronous, so `onTrigger()` and methods it calls must be implemented in a thread-safe manner.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2146154785/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2146187129","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/8913#issuecomment-2146187129","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/8913","id":2146187129,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5_7Dd5","user":{"login":"joewitt","id":3057465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTc0NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3057465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt","html_url":"https://github.com/joewitt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-03T21:51:00Z","updated_at":"2024-06-03T21:51:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 pending build results.
