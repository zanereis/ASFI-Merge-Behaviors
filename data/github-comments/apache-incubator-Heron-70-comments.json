This is an easy/quick change at least.\r\n\r\nIt is definitely not overly cautious. :)  I have the same concern when making the change. Integration tests don't rely on zk so it is not covered.\r\n\r\nFor us the zookeeper cluster is maintained by a different team and there could be internal changes, so I have no idea which version it is. :D  But I feel it is a reasonable expectation for them to be compatible.  This zk release has been a few month till now and it has been used by other project. So I am feeling relatively comfortable. Anyways, more testing is definitely a good idea.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/532760374/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/532900918","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/3332#issuecomment-532900918","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/3332","id":532900918,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMjkwMDkxOA==","user":{"login":"joshfischer1108","id":5785700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3ODU3MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5785700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshfischer1108","html_url":"https://github.com/joshfischer1108","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshfischer1108/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshfischer1108/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshfischer1108/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshfischer1108/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshfischer1108/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshfischer1108/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshfischer1108/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshfischer1108/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshfischer1108/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-18T23:09:47Z","updated_at":"2019-09-18T23:09:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@ChethanUK
