Seems like a lot of commonality of code with compaction, are we planning on merging them together ?\r\n> 2. I see that we are going to allow schedule clustering for file groups that even have log files, in the scheduling process are we checking if a compaction is already scheduled for some file groups for which we cannot schedule clustering ?\r\n\r\n1. This PR just includes FileSystemView APIs. I think its better to keep them separate APIs because  the functionality is different (updates are allowed for files in compaction for example).  When actual scheduling and clustering is implemented, its possible to reuse some of core logic such as ActionExecutors. Let me know if you see better way to organize this and share  FileSystemView API as well\r\n2. scheduling logic is not implemented yet. This is just first PR to cover high level FileSystemView APIs. The next PR will include this logic.  Let me know if you want me to combine everything into one PR or if you have any other feedback.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/718182030/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/718240937","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/2208#issuecomment-718240937","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/2208","id":718240937,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxODI0MDkzNw==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-28T22:18:25Z","updated_at":"2020-12-09T03:19:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/hudi/pull/2208?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#2208](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/hudi/pull/2208?src=pr&el=desc) (d51d392) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/hudi/commit/3a91d26d625415b7ccd74f9f32418f8a84aa3e3c?el=desc) (3a91d26) will **decrease** coverage by `43.13%`.\n> The diff coverage is `20.00%`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/hudi/pull/2208/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&height=150&src=pr&token=VTTXabwbs2)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/hudi/pull/2208?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@              Coverage Diff              @@\n##             master    #2208       +/-   ##\n=============================================\n- Coverage     53.49%   10.35%   -43.14%     \n+ Complexity     2788       48     -2740     \n=============================================\n  Files           355       51      -304     \n  Lines         16169     1786    -14383     \n  Branches       1650      213     -1437     \n=============================================\n- Hits           8649      185     -8464     \n+ Misses         6819     1588     -5231     \n+ Partials        701       13      -688     \n```\n\n| Flag | Coverage Δ | Complexity Δ | |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| hudicli | `?` | `?` | |\n| hudiclient | `?` | `?` | |\n| hudicommon | `?` | `?` | |\n| hudihadoopmr | `?` | `?` | |\n| hudispark | `?` | `?` | |\n| huditimelineservice | `?` | `?` | |\n| hudiutilities | `10.35% <20.00%> (-59.75%)` | `0.00 <1.00> (ø)` | |\n\nFlags with carried forward coverage won't be shown.
