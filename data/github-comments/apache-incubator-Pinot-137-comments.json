While as you mentioned there are two major steps that require servers to handle. For building indices, you can enable the index generation logic during the segment generation so that servers won't be busy doing so. You can enable it in the table config.

That way it would be much easier to tell what happened on broker or server or at segment level?\r\n\r\n@amrishlal this is a good idea, thanks for the suggestion! Discussed with @siddharthteotia and we decided to pick this up as a future enhancement (we plan to add additional explain nodes and other improvements).

Can we enhance the test to also check that?\r\n\r\nI was helping out with #6487 and verified that not all queries which claim to use the StarTree in this test do, it would be useful to have that metadata to help assert","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1133550853/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1133558247","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/8589#issuecomment-1133558247","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/8589","id":1133558247,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5DkLnn","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-21T07:47:14Z","updated_at":"2022-05-31T01:33:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/8589?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) Report\n> Merging [#8589](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/8589?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (5bf84c8) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/commit/4d36f3dfbfc68e5b4f5cf24d7313d20a31e74155?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (4d36f3d) will **increase** coverage by `40.23%`.\n> The diff coverage is `76.81%`.\n\n```diff\n@@              Coverage Diff              @@\n##             master    #8589       +/-   ##\n=============================================\n+ Coverage     29.41%   69.64%   +40.23%     \n- Complexity        0     4617     +4617     \n=============================================\n  Files          1680     1736       +56     \n  Lines         88398    91279     +2881     \n  Branches      13432    13641      +209     \n=============================================\n+ Hits          25998    63574    +37576     \n+ Misses        60013    23276    -36737     \n- Partials       2387     4429     +2042     \n```\n\n| Flag | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| integration1 | `26.90% <4.34%> (-0.37%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| integration2 | `25.62% <76.81%> (+0.06%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| unittests1 | `66.15% <ø> (?)` | |\n| unittests2 | `14.13% <4.34%> (?)` | |\n\nFlags with carried forward coverage won't be shown.

do we have some numbers on the impact on performance?\r\n\r\n@kishoreg just to clarify, the purpose of this PR is to do the following:\r\n- Improve the accuracy of group-by only queries by adding a new query rewriter. This query rewriter just converts group-by queries to include order-by.\r\n- The new query rewriter is disabled by default because of the potential performance penalty. Only customers who need the improved accuracy and are willing to take the performance hit should enable this feature.\r\n- The query performance for group-by only query after adding order by (via the rewriter) will be no worse than running the same query with order by originally specified by the user\r\n\r\nWe can get perf numbers that compare a given query with group-by only and with group-by + order-by and get back to you on the difference. \r\n\r\nHope this clarifies this change better.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1134900187/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1134900784","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/8607#issuecomment-1134900784","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/8607","id":1134900784,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5DpTYw","user":{"login":"siddharthteotia","id":2150694,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTA2OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2150694?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia","html_url":"https://github.com/siddharthteotia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-23T16:40:58Z","updated_at":"2022-05-23T16:40:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Fixed

So, for a dictionary encoded column it is not absolutely necessary to dictionary encode the forward index as well. The raw data in forward index can be compressed using LZ4 / SNAPPY etc just like we would have done for a noDictionary column\r\n- The other way we are thinking is to also add support for no forward index.\r\n\r\nI think both approaches can be implemented and will benefit the case where forward index can be huge (like the MV column example in my issue) and the column is only used in filtering so ok to have the forward index compressed or not have it at all.

In the query executor:\r\n1. Implicitly order-by the group-by columns not included in the order-by if the explicit order-by clause have the same value for 2 groups\r\n2. If there is no aggregation in the order-by clause, we don't need to keep more groups than the `LIMIT`. We should make a priority queue + map solution to only keep track of the top `LIMIT` groups. This solution can always give the accurate result, but without adding too much overhead","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1135212171/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1135213718","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/8761#issuecomment-1135213718","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/8761","id":1135213718,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5DqfyW","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-23T22:55:14Z","updated_at":"2022-05-23T23:13:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/8761?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) Report\n> Merging [#8761](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/8761?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (c62d587) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/commit/821976610e7dede823807d34660b0dae6576e7c0?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (8219766) will **decrease** coverage by `0.02%`.\n> The diff coverage is `100.00%`.\n\n```diff\n@@             Coverage Diff              @@\n##             master    #8761      +/-   ##\n============================================\n- Coverage     69.67%   69.65%   -0.03%     \n+ Complexity     4619     4615       -4     \n============================================\n  Files          1732     1732              \n  Lines         90722    90734      +12     \n  Branches      13505    13507       +2     \n============================================\n- Hits          63210    63200      -10     \n- Misses        23117    23129      +12     \n- Partials       4395     4405      +10     \n```\n\n| Flag | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| integration1 | `26.97% <66.66%> (+0.04%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| integration2 | `25.23% <8.33%> (-0.18%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| unittests1 | `66.28% <0.00%> (-0.02%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| unittests2 | `14.24% <91.66%> (+0.05%)` | :arrow_up: |\n\nFlags with carried forward coverage won't be shown.

?\r\n\r\nYes, it's important to understand Hotspot inlining limitations (for anyone who isn't aware)\r\n1. Three or more implementations (polymorphic call site) will never get inlined, but the offset into the vtable may get cached to speed up the dispatch, but any inlining dependent optimisations (scalarisation, counted loop optimisations) won't happen\r\n2. Two or more implementations (biomorphic call site) may get inlined with a type condition, subject to other conditions (bytecode size, inlining depth, inlined stub size)\r\n1. One implementation (monomorphic call site) will get inlined, subject to the same conditions, lots of implementations follow from this\r\n\r\nVectorisation ameliorates all of this and amortises function call overheads, costs of missed optimisations, creates larger scopes for Hotspot to optimise within the method which processes the batch. It's probably worth making more disruptive changes to push vectorisation all the way up to the top given that the code is JIT compiled.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1136099841/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1136101348","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/8764#issuecomment-1136101348","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/8764","id":1136101348,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5Dt4fk","user":{"login":"richardstartin","id":16439049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDM5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16439049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin","html_url":"https://github.com/richardstartin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-24T15:50:29Z","updated_at":"2022-05-24T15:50:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Also, whether saving a bit per value is worth the runtime cost of an extra dictionary reader implementation is an important design discussion.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1136101348/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1136152301","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/8764#issuecomment-1136152301","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/8764","id":1136152301,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5DuE7t","user":{"login":"siddharthteotia","id":2150694,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTA2OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2150694?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia","html_url":"https://github.com/siddharthteotia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-24T16:38:56Z","updated_at":"2022-05-24T16:38:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Also, whether saving a bit per value is worth the runtime cost of an extra dictionary reader implementation is an important design discussion.\r\n\r\nI agree.
