I was able to reproduce it, but also I found working solution. This mock works correctly. The problem appears when unit test is run with other tests: [DateTimeZone](https://github.com/JodaOrg/joda-time/blob/ba95735daf79d00ce0928f30701d691f5e029d81/src/main/java/org/joda/time/DateTimeZone.java) class contains static field [cDefault](https://github.com/JodaOrg/joda-time/blob/ba95735daf79d00ce0928f30701d691f5e029d81/src/main/java/org/joda/time/DateTimeZone.java#L128) which is used to receive timezone in `testToDateForTimeStamp()` and in other tests. When timezone does not set to this field, but method [getDefault()](https://github.com/JodaOrg/joda-time/blob/ba95735daf79d00ce0928f30701d691f5e029d81/src/main/java/org/joda/time/DateTimeZone.java#L149) is called, value is taken from `System.getProperty()`. \r\nWhen the first test that calls this method does not have a mock, it sets a real value of timezone from `System.getProperty()`. Therefore our test uses a unmocked value from `cDefault`. \r\n\r\nSo lets mock `DateTimeZone.getDefault()` method:\r\n```\r\n    new MockUp<DateTimeZone>() {\r\n      @Mock\r\n      public DateTimeZone getDefault() {\r\n        return DateTimeZone.UTC;\r\n      }\r\n    };\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/338737416/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/338744189","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/996#issuecomment-338744189","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/996","id":338744189,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzODc0NDE4OQ==","user":{"login":"HanumathRao","id":5264087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNjQwODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5264087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao","html_url":"https://github.com/HanumathRao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-23T17:58:03Z","updated_at":"2017-10-23T17:58:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@arina-ielchiieva Thank your for the comments.

again thanks for the detailed review; I was able to address most of the feedback except for one:\r\nURF-8 Encoded Based Processing\r\n- I agree that expressions that can operate directly on the encoded UTF-8 string should ideally perform  checks on bytes and not characters\r\n- Having said that, such a change is more involved and should be done properly\r\n   o The SqlPatternContainsMatcher currently gets a CharSequence as input\r\n   o We should enhance the expression framework so that matchers can a) express their capabilities and b) receive the expected data type (Character or Byte sequences)\r\n   o The compiler might also need an enhancement; currently, the optimizer adds a varchar cast to Parquet columns of binary data types which are involved with the LIKE operator (the cast logic will iterate through the whole byte array)\r\n  o Note also there is an impact on the test-suite since StringBuffer are being used to directly test the matcher functionality \r\n\r\nByte Code Manipulation\r\n- I looked at the Byte Code implementation to ensure the newly added scalar variable doesn't break the VarCharHolder optimization (stack allocation instead of heap)\r\n- The code uses reflection and as such is able to handle new member variables","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/338752108/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/338815178","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/870#issuecomment-338815178","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/870","id":338815178,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzODgxNTE3OA==","user":{"login":"sohami","id":22159459,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTU5NDU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22159459?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohami","html_url":"https://github.com/sohami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-23T22:27:31Z","updated_at":"2017-10-23T22:27:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"closing
