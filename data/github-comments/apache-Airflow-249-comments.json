I also added a quick note on this change to the AWS connection docs.\r\n\r\nLet me try to reiterate once again why do I think this change should be applied: When you install Airflow right now and use either the `AIRFLOW_CONN_` environment variable or the `~/.aws/credentials` to set the AWS connection parameters, the region setting gets ignored and `us-east-1` gets used. The only way of finding that out is diving deep into `botocore` and trying to debug the values it gets passed by Airflow, which is what prompted me to create this Pull Request. Just documenting the fact would be certainly helpful, but I believe this change would be much better: in the case I outlined above you would receive a `NoRegionSet` error which is much more informational than the current state of silently falling back to `us-east-1`.\r\n\r\nThat said, if you do not agree with this change for any reason, I am happy to close this PR and create a new one that would only add the documentation bit.\r\n\r\nThanks again!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/524446941/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/524455961","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5828#issuecomment-524455961","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5828","id":524455961,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNDQ1NTk2MQ==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-23T20:43:50Z","updated_at":"2019-08-23T20:43:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Geee.

looking at the code again I don't think this will handle asynchronous calls to Lambda very well, if at all.

Some info [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-invocation.html).\r\n\r\nFor my use case making synchronous calls is fine so I've been using the default \"RequestResponse\" invocation type.

Per LinkedIn, Pierre was at Happn and is now at Payfit. However, I don't know if it is clear to people whether the readme entry reflects where someone works now or at which companies they used Airflow. I think there is value in the latter since it shows a certain ambassadorship as well as lets us know if people are being hired due to their expertise with Airflow. In my case, I kept my handle under Agari, but added it for PayPal. If I removed my name from Agari, there would be no other connection to Airflow at Agari.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/525495590/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/525498189","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5927#issuecomment-525498189","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5927","id":525498189,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNTQ5ODE4OQ==","user":{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-27T21:53:52Z","updated_at":"2019-08-27T21:53:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Makes sense.
