If you are using equivalent (`.equals(o)`) instances instead then this will be a cache miss and the cache won't be providing much value. Since it is weak keys this seems like a likely mistake and of course lets the GC collect aggressively, so you might not get a lot of reuse. It is often a helpful feature for cases like caching request-scoped data, and I'm not familiar enough with the code base to assess if this is a problematic usage. Typically a bounded cache is better and more explicit, but does require some mental effort to decide on a decent maximum size.\r\n\r\nOtherwise if should perform similarly to a ConcurrentHashMap from

I found the  data skew problem still here on IcebergWriter stage.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion,  there are two points:\r\n- we need a method to distribute data to different task evenly, but I think the HASH method is not very fit. So I tried to calculate a weight value for every partition, then mod to different task to  execute. \r\n- If mode 'NONE' is used, I think a task will handle multi-partition data, on pos/eq deletion procedure will cause OOM and may occur little file problem. This is also a resource distribution problem.

The way I created the Iceberg tables from the TPD-DS Hive tables is using the snapshot procedure to create them in a different database:\r\n```\r\nspark.sql(\"create database tpcds_iceberg\")\r\nspark.sql(\"use tpcds\")\r\nval tables = spark.sql(\"show tables\")\r\ntables.collect().map(r => r(1).toString).foreach(t =>\r\n  spark.sql(s\"call spark_catalog.system.snapshot('tpcds.$t', 'tpcds_iceberg.$t')\")\r\n)\r\n```\r\nThis creates Iceberg tables backed by the same underlying data. As we're not writing to the tables, this does not create any problems.\r\nFor the same value of `spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold` Spark will use a broadcast join in some of the TPC-DS queries on Hive tables but use a SortMergeJoin on the Iceberg tables. This is because the way Spark estimates the size of the relation for the native table case is different from the way Iceberg estimates the size. For the native table case, Spark uses file size in its estimation. File size can be a significant underestimate as in your case, where you are using Snappy-compressed Parquet files, as most folks don't even set `spark.sql.sources.fileCompressionFactor` (which defaults to 1.0). Iceberg estimates the size of the relation by multiplying the estimated width of the requested columns by the number of rows. In my original commit for https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3038, I used the same approach to estimating the size of the relation that Spark uses for `FileScan`s, but @rdblue suggested to use the approach actually adopted.\r\nTo get Spark to use broadcast joins for the Iceberg tables, you can set a higher value for `spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold`. The problem is that it is hard to compare apples with apples in this case.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1058730372/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1058741293","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/4144#issuecomment-1058741293","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4144","id":1058741293,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX84_Gxwt","user":{"login":"wypoon","id":3925490,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjU0OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3925490?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon","html_url":"https://github.com/wypoon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-04T01:40:57Z","updated_at":"2022-03-04T18:16:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"If you are getting that error, it means that your table's history contains snapshots with timestamps that are out of order.

So I just need to  keep the code now as it is  , And waiting for it to be merged.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1058746869/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1058748283","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4258#issuecomment-1058748283","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4258","id":1058748283,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX84_Gzd7","user":{"login":"hzluting","id":5558252,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTgyNTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5558252?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzluting","html_url":"https://github.com/hzluting","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzluting/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzluting/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzluting/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzluting/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzluting/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzluting/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzluting/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzluting/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzluting/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-04T01:56:04Z","updated_at":"2022-03-04T01:56:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Sorry I just read the original issue as it wasnt linked (#3895 ) , I get it now and think would be great to have a Javadoc on this class.\r\n> \r\n> I think the problem is that this proposed Javadoc is developer-facing, and should be user-facing.

You are right, if a single prefix is shared by many tables and object store locations are enabled, the only way to remove orphans is by getting a list of all files under that prefix and querying systems tables for all Iceberg tables. However, I am not sure that's always possible. You have to assume no extra jobs use that location, you know all metastores/catalogs, etc. I'd say having a short per-table prefix or a set of prefixes would be also quite common. I can be convinced otherwise.\r\n\r\nThis is an interesting idea I also considered at one point, having the option to provide the whole listing for S3-based storage bucket, filter out for all locations owned by known tables, and run remove orphans on those locations?  If you know ahead of time your 'bucket' is majority files iceberg tables, might be less expensive overall (though this sounds like a single monster job if we are bottlenecked at the speed of physically deleting the files).  Another consideration is that system like S3 inventory will be stale in order of hours or days.\r\n\r\nThough it still seems to go back to the the main question, how to define the \"owned locations\" of a table?  (Sorry, please let me know if there is discussion on it already I missed).  That would be great to have, one thing I struggled in the past is \"alter table location\", if the previous locations can somehow be saved in a growing list it could allow to run more complete orphan removal jobs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1059409098/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1059416924","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4258#issuecomment-1059416924","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4258","id":1059416924,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX84_JWtc","user":{"login":"szehon-ho","id":20555759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTU1NzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20555759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho","html_url":"https://github.com/szehon-ho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-04T18:33:23Z","updated_at":"2022-03-04T18:59:52Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"I think it needs a bit more context, how about something like:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Exception raised when validation checks fail.

However, path-based tables are quite special: there is no table pointer in the catalog. Any thoughts on what drop without purge may mean for them?

on Yufei’s design doc and what we discussed during the sync, I’d like to share my thoughts on what can be efficiently supported right now.\r\n\r\n### Assumptions\r\n\r\n- Changes are consumed per snapshot, rows that are added and removed in the same snapshot can be skipped\r\n\r\nIceberg does not distinguish the order of records within a snapshot. Users may manually deduce this using a data column. However, there is nothing in the metadata to support this at the moment. I believe it is sufficient to have a summary of what changed per snapshot for most use cases (except the audit use case). Specifically, if we add a record and immediately delete it in the same snapshot (Flink CDC), it is okay to skip this record and not report it in the CDC log.\r\n\r\n- Output only delete and insert record types\r\n\r\nFrom what I see, just knowing what records to remove and to add should be enough to support most use cases. I have an example below even if the target system is not Iceberg. In the future, we can add pre/post images but computing that with the current table metadata would require a join and would be expensive.\r\n\r\n- Table must have identity columns defined\r\n\r\nWhenever we apply a delta log to a target table, most CDC use cases rely on a primary key or a set of identity columns. I think it is reasonable to assume Iceberg tables should have identity columns defined to support generation of CDC records.\r\n\r\n- Delete records may only include values for identity columns\r\n \r\nIt is not required to output the entire deleted record if other columns are not stored in equality delete files. If values for other columns are not persisted, this would require an expensive join to reconstruct the entire row.\r\n\r\n### Unsupported\r\n\r\n- Audit use cases as they require a seq number per row\r\n- Pre/post update image (can be added in the future)\r\n\r\nThe CDC record can include: \r\n```\r\n_record_type, _commit_snapshot_id, _commit_timestamp, _commit_order, _identity_columns, col1, col2, ...\r\n```\r\n### Algorithm (per snapshot)\r\n\r\n- Build insert records\r\n\t- Read all data files written in this snapshot, applying any matching position delete files produced in the same snapshot. Equality deletes produced in this snapshot cannot apply.\r\n- Build delete records\r\n\t- Read all data files marked as deleted in this snapshot (they always contain values for identity columns).\r\n\t- Read all equality deletes (they always contain values for identity columns)\r\n\t- Read position deletes, find the list of affected data files from previous snapshots, read those data files, join on `_file`, `_pos` with deletes, project identity columns.\r\n- Append metadata such as `_commit_snapshot_id` or `_record_type`\r\n- Union insert and delete records \r\n\r\nThe algorithm would only require one join to find identity columns for position deletes. However, it should be fairly efficient as position deletes are scoped to partitions and we know the exact file names to read. We don’t have to read any other files or do a full table scan.\r\n\r\nI think it should be sufficient to have only delete/insert record types in most cases. A generic MERGE statement can be used to apply changes for a single snapshot to both Iceberg and non-Iceberg tables.\r\n\r\n```\r\nMERGE INTO target t USING source s\r\nON t.id_col = s.id_col AND s._record_type = 'DELETE'\r\nWHEN MATCHED\r\n  DELETE\r\nWHEN NOT MATCHED\r\n  INSERT …\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the destination table is another Iceberg table, we may skip the MERGE statement and write equality deletes and data files directly without querying the destination table.\r\n\r\nHere are a few examples (inspired by what Yufei has put together) I went through to see if this approach is going to work (double check it, please).\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6235869/157117118-446f7ecd-77ca-48ae-b250-3254c1dbf529.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1061153554/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1061187372","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4280#issuecomment-1061187372","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4280","id":1061187372,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX84_QG8s","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-07T22:08:31Z","updated_at":"2022-03-07T22:08:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@xiaoxuandev can you add details?

Dynamic loading is used where we want to be able to customize the implementation from the catalog. For example, a catalog may dynamically choose GCS or S3 or another FileIO implementation based on the catalog settings and table details (like root location). But the metrics reporting that this affects are being passed back to a processing engine, which is determined by the environment.\r\n\r\nWhat we've been discussing for Flink is to have some way to connect FileIO metrics to Flink jobs and tasks, which likely means passing in a MetricsContext from Flink. This conflicts with the idea of passing down configuration that defines it. It doesn't make sense to me that we might allow a catalog or table to override something that is engine-specific.\r\n\r\nOne thing that Iceberg has been fairly successful at so far is trying to put configuration in the right place. I think this is really similar: we should not use table or catalog configuration for engine concerns.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1061291885/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1061293862","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4208#issuecomment-1061293862","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4208","id":1061293862,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX84_Qg8m","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-08T00:50:53Z","updated_at":"2022-03-08T00:50:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks like we need to turn off CI for `docs/` paths. @kbendick, can you open a PR?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1061293862/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1061295082","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4208#issuecomment-1061295082","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4208","id":1061295082,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX84_QhPq","user":{"login":"kbendick","id":9833362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MzMzNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9833362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick","html_url":"https://github.com/kbendick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-08T00:53:30Z","updated_at":"2022-03-08T00:53:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Looks like we need to turn off CI for `docs/` paths. @kbendick, can you open a PR?\r\n\r\nYeah will do so now.
