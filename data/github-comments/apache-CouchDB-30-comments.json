The binary data there is showing the nodes in the btree, but a byte-by-byte analysis is not something anyone on the project right now has time to complete.\r\n\r\nThe most likely scenarios for this are that you are in a virtualised environment where the disk goes away, you have `delayed_commits` set to `true` and a disk is intermittently failing (lesson: ALWAYS set `delayed_commits` to `false`!), or you are using network-attached storage (such as EBS) and the volume has become corrupted. If you're in a cloud/hosted environment, you may want to check with your hosting provider to determine if anything can be done to guarantee disk performance. Another possibility is failing RAM that caused a bit-flip, or (yes, really) cosmic rays doing the same. The typical safeguard for this in production is to only run on servers with ECC RAM.\r\n\r\nCouchDB 1.6.1 has been running in the field for many years on hundreds of thousands of servers, and there are no known issues that definitively cause corruption in databases aside from the well-known scenarios described above.\r\n\r\nYour best options are:\r\n\r\n1. Restore the database from backup prior to when file corruption occurred. (You are backing up your server, aren't you? 😉 )\r\n2. Write a custom replication to read documents from the database and skip documents that fail. You may not be able to use the `/{db}/_changes` feed for this if there is corruption in the sequence; try using `/{db}/_all_docs` if this is true\r\n3.

Do you mean use of the actual `/{db}/_purge` endpoint, or just document deletion? As the warning in the documentation states, this is an endpoint of last resort.

It means \"no sessions\". You could have sessions with stateless tokens (see my example below).\r\n\r\nThe point of token authentication in a general sense is that the user does not have to send his credentials with every request, so if a token is intercepted (CSRF, MITM, ...) the attacker has less than the credentials. \"Less\" means, for example, that once the user \"logs out\", all tokens become worthless. The point of this ticket was to suggest this functionality - a way to invalidate all tokens still out there.\r\n\r\nHowever, the server would have to store at least the timestamp of the last \"log out\" operation, then it could refuse all tokens coming in after that timestamp. The next \"log in\" event (session creation) would then delete this timestamp. And session creation is only possible with the credentials, which the attacker doesn't have (I assume the credentials are hashed/salted).\r\n\r\nA completely stateless solution is not possible, because all the token contains is the user's credentials and we cannot invalidate the credentials. But storing one additional timestamp per user would still be stateless in the sense that it doesn't change CouchDB's scaling properties. It is not a per-session value (which indeed would affect scalability), but a per-user value that could even be eventually consistent.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/333333038/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/333333680","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/844#issuecomment-333333680","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/844","id":333333680,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMzMzMzY4MA==","user":{"login":"realulim","id":17084846,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDg0ODQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17084846?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/realulim","html_url":"https://github.com/realulim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/realulim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/realulim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/realulim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/realulim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/realulim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/realulim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/realulim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/realulim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/realulim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-30T20:22:43Z","updated_at":"2017-09-30T20:22:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"s/delete

This issue already gave me enough headaches and it was likely just something wrong with my machines config since other couchdb setups I've done work just fine.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/333525878/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/333562139","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/857#issuecomment-333562139","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/857","id":333562139,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMzU2MjEzOQ==","user":{"login":"wohali","id":112292,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjI5Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112292?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali","html_url":"https://github.com/wohali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-02T15:04:19Z","updated_at":"2017-10-02T15:04:19Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This is a really broad request for a single \"bug\" report.

If we indexed everything, and we queried ```{\"foo\": {\"$exists\": false}}```, then we would return  all the documents in the db that did not have \"foo\" as a field in the document. However, if you explicitly indexed \"foo\", then you would get 0 results back because you only indexed the subset of documents that contained \"foo\" as a field. The large (all_docs)superset is not part of the index, and therefore would not be returned. So _all_docs, explicit json index, index everything, and explicit text index would all return different results. \r\n\r\nEdit: looks like you're deferring to _all_docs as a special case for $exists:false here:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/couchdb/commit/503f3e34afa0a68e91258ca864e70ab18e6584e2\r\n\r\nEdit 2: So after giving it some thought, I think _all_docs and index everything(text) should return the same results. Explicitly defined json indexes and text indexes should return the same thing for a given query. But what's tricky here is that we'll be defaulting to _all_docs with a single $exists: false query which leads to different results for the user even though we're using a different index.

User doesn't complain because the docs look sorted.\r\n\r\nIn the scenario where we ignore sort order and used _all_docs, I would assume the user would have already complained that their documents are not sorted.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we should improve the error messages returned?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/334564094/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/334601791","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/745#issuecomment-334601791","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/745","id":334601791,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNDYwMTc5MQ==","user":{"login":"wohali","id":112292,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjI5Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112292?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali","html_url":"https://github.com/wohali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-05T21:49:15Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T21:49:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Seeing this now in multiple production environments.

Can you provide an example where you think we'll trip up (or ideally, a failing test)?\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, I think we should consider it a bug whenever there is variation in results due to indexes being present, the exception being index-specific operators such as `$text`. The expectation is that a user will start with no indexes (so queries will default to _all_docs) and add indexes when necessary to improve performance or when sorting is required. Adding an index to an existing application should never change the results of queries already being used.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to note, for awareness, is that an explicit [partial index](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/808) could be used to optimise an `{\"$exists\": false}` selector but these require users to opt-in - the query planner will never automatically select them.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/334692468/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/334697125","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/866#issuecomment-334697125","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/866","id":334697125,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNDY5NzEyNQ==","user":{"login":"willholley","id":97787,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3Nzg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/97787?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willholley","html_url":"https://github.com/willholley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willholley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willholley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willholley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willholley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willholley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willholley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willholley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willholley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willholley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-06T08:51:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-06T08:51:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@tonysun83 this PR should improve the error message in the case where a user specifies an index with `use_index` that is no longer deemed valid.
