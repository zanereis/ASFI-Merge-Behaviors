However only FPGA synthesis, placement and route will actually tell; it might be a good experiment to try.\r\n\r\nWe can have both or more, this is one of the advantage of the language. However, in terms of the FIR style chain we would have to make a compromise, because right now we are assuming that the `MatrixVectorMultiplication` unit can consume operands every cycle. With the FIR style design, if I understood the idea correctly, the operands need to available during the entire pipeline because multiplication and accumulation happens at every stage in the pipeline. The benefit of this style as you said is that you will end up with `blockOut` * `blockIn` DSP but at the expense of performance hit because operands has to available during the entire computation.\r\n\r\nThis was actually how I started the design. The `Baseline` bar in the following [figure](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~vegaluis/notes/cycles.png) show the cycles spent by VTA using this approach (FIR style), the other two are using the current style.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/514703823/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/514715131","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/3610#issuecomment-514715131","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3610","id":514715131,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNDcxNTEzMQ==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-24T16:58:36Z","updated_at":"2019-07-24T16:58:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Let us keep the discussion in the discuss, once we have an actionable item, the open a new issue to resolve it","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/514715131/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/514725044","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/3610#issuecomment-514725044","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3610","id":514725044,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNDcyNTA0NA==","user":{"login":"anijain2305","id":13822661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODIyNjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13822661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305","html_url":"https://github.com/anijain2305","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-24T17:26:59Z","updated_at":"2019-07-24T17:26:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tqchen Makes sense. \r\n\r\nHowever, the reason I opened the issue is that people might not know about discuss forum.

I'd like to move to this RFC thread to loop more people with my consideration.\r\n\r\nBefore going far, let me clarify that, `Requantize` is obviously needed to support int32 input which is the accumulated multiplication intermediate result in conv2d when tensor type is int8. The problem is about whether `Quantize`/`Dequantize` of which the output/input needs int32 - which means a *32 bit integer quantization approach*. (or even 16 bit)\r\n\r\nFirst, which is trivial, if we can use 32 bit, why not 32 bit floating point rather than integer. Yes, there is devices supporting only integer, but, the industry shows that 8 bit is enough for accuracy and they are even moving to 4 bit. So, maybe we don't need to be so generic I guess. The less is more :)\r\n\r\nSecond, I wonder that it's impossible to support 32 bit due to arithmetic limitations.\r\n1. Let's start from 8 bit. Considering we are using 8 bit quantization approach, of which the tensor value range is (-2^7, 2^7]. Multiplying two int8 generates value range (-2^14, 2^14]. As the accumulation could be of thousands, it's not safe to accumulate them in int16, but int32. That is why we need int32 in int8 quantization.\r\n2. Similarly, taking 16 bit. The original value range is (-2^15, 2^15], and multiplied to be (-2^30, 2^30]. When accumulating, we should use 64 bit integer. Hmmm, int64 is still available though needs to be emulated sometimes on very low-low-end device. In this way, `Requantize` needs to support 64 bit input if we are going to enable 16 bit support.\r\n3. Now, 32 bit.

Perhaps that would make the intrinsic's pattern easier to detect.\r\n\r\nFrom the publicity, I think these dlboost/vnni avx512 simd operations are considered important for the new xeon ai inference support.\r\n\r\nI'm providing the expanded intrinsic description for one of the ops as an example\r\n\r\n` https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide/#avx512techs=AVX512_VNNI&expand=2202  `\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/515171346/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/515175031","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/3591#issuecomment-515175031","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3591","id":515175031,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNTE3NTAzMQ==","user":{"login":"anijain2305","id":13822661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODIyNjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13822661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305","html_url":"https://github.com/anijain2305","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-25T19:07:08Z","updated_at":"2019-07-25T19:08:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jnorwood We are using intrinsics for Skylake (not VNNI) and there is already a PR to take advantage of VNNI intrinsics for Cascade Lake #3388 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/515175031/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/515195797","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3512#issuecomment-515195797","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3512","id":515195797,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNTE5NTc5Nw==","user":{"login":"shoubhik","id":2293791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTM3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2293791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shoubhik","html_url":"https://github.com/shoubhik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shoubhik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shoubhik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shoubhik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shoubhik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shoubhik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shoubhik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shoubhik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shoubhik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shoubhik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-25T20:09:52Z","updated_at":"2019-07-25T20:09:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"There are quite a lot of changes here that are depndent on #3531 .
