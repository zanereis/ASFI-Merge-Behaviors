After some code digging, i noticed that `instance-conf-path` will always remain to the default value (`HOME_PATH+github.com/apache/pulsar/pulsar-function-go/conf/conf.yaml`) according to (ref: https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/6ff1bbae0fe230eb72d62574d7685a745f884416/pulsar-functions/runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/functions/runtime/RuntimeUtils.java#L223 ) and (ref: https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/6ff1bbae0fe230eb72d62574d7685a745f884416/pulsar-function-go/conf/conf.go#L126 ).\r\n\r\nThen i got following problems:\r\n\r\n- the default settings comes from `HOME_PATH+github.com/apache/pulsar/pulsar-function-go/conf/conf.yaml`, which normally not exist in production env, so i assume this `conf.yaml` is not default settings. Also, the default path is quite strange for production use.\r\n- if the default settings file is not exist, then `yamlFile, err := ioutil.ReadFile(confFilePath)` will throw a panic error with `not found conf file`, and the function failed.\r\n\r\nApparently, when golang function triggered with process runtime, no `instance-conf-path` will pass to function executable, and the default path will always cause panic under production env unless user manually create the strange path config file.\r\n\r\nAs the result, i committed this PR to solve the problem we got.
