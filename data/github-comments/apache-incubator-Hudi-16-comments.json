This ticket is talking about upgrading the client (HUDI) to Hive 2.x. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the above exception tells me there is some jar conflict in the way you're bundling and running HiveSyncTool. How are you running/executing the tool ? Can you take a look at your hadoop classpath to see if there's something amiss ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/456262173/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/456266074","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/552#issuecomment-456266074","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/552","id":456266074,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NjI2NjA3NA==","user":{"login":"n3nash","id":2722167,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MjIxNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2722167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash","html_url":"https://github.com/n3nash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-22T04:17:46Z","updated_at":"2019-01-22T04:17:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"There isn't any generic recommended spark duration, it depends on a lot of factors such as amount of data ingested, parallelism of your job, how long it takes for you to write a 256 MB parquet file in your cluster etc which is best controlled by the clients. \r\nHaving said that, here is what I'm saying : \r\n\r\n1. Using bulkInsert() -> Depending on the spread of your data, this may create some small files. The bulkInsert() API does NOT do small file sizing, so in a scenario where you keep performing bulkInserts() on a dataset, you will end up creating small files.\r\n2. Using upsert() -> This API takes a bunch of inserts and updates, applies the updates to existing data in files and pads the inserts to existing small files. If the number of inserts << the number of small files, it will take a long time for all the small files to be padded enough to reach 128MB file size.\r\n\r\nSo in summary, if you are using bulkInsert() repeatedly, you can see the side effect. If you are using upsert() after a bunch of small files are already lying around in your dataset, depending on how many inserts you are performing every batch, it will take sometime for all small files to be padded. \r\nHope this makes things more clear.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/456266074/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/456340662","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/552#issuecomment-456340662","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/552","id":456340662,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NjM0MDY2Mg==","user":{"login":"louisliu318","id":9956334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5NTYzMzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9956334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/louisliu318","html_url":"https://github.com/louisliu318","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/louisliu318/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/louisliu318/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/louisliu318/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/louisliu318/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/louisliu318/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/louisliu318/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/louisliu318/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/louisliu318/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/louisliu318/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-22T10:02:00Z","updated_at":"2019-01-22T10:02:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@n3nash Thanks for your tips.

We will prioritize this in feb. \r\n\r\n>> Does HUDI support composite partition columns ?\r\n\r\nHudi just treats partitionpath as a string, separated by `/`. You can customize it based on how you want it. Does that help? \r\n\r\n>> Does HUDI support for composite primary key ?\r\n\r\nYes. But, again, you can combine the composite keys into a string and make it the key. Hudi adds a special _hoodie_record_key field to your data with this combined value.\r\n\r\n>> Does HUDI support gz file as source ?\r\n\r\nHudi DeltaStreamer does support avro and json/gz files as input. Does that work? It should be easy to add a new file type.\r\n\r\n>> Also when we are running on 50 gb data it is taking more time in last job of collect in commit method. \r\n\r\nIf you can paste your spark UI and configs, we can help tune..

I am splitting input dataset into 40 parts and lading that to Hudi table. [Code link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1O7omCp9BPWQAoHNKY7FJEV-J8w9mxQlW)\r\n\r\n2. Input dataset is hdfs parquet dataset. Its size is 46G. I was not able to load it at once because of same disk space issue. So input is divided into 50 parts. Code link provided above.\r\n\r\n[hadoop@ip-xxx-181 ~]$  hdfs dfs -du -s -h '/*'\r\n15.7 M  /apps\r\n596.1 M  /hudi-data\r\n773.4 M  /tmp\r\n47.7 G  /user\r\n1.8 G  /var\r\n\r\n3. Yes. As I am loading data in multiple parts initial parts of data has got loaded. Code link provided above has Hudi configs that I use\r\n\r\n4.  [Link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1OKfXg0tM4f5_z4ALhYA3KaSAezUW3yjr) to spark properties. Below is screenshot of job that is running now. I will upload another one after job runs for few more hours to give a better picture of the current run.\r\n![screen shot 2019-02-20 at 2 07 28 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47641088/53128157-0a9c9800-3519-11e9-802d-c930054a3d64.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/465775772/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/465804660","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/571#issuecomment-465804660","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/571","id":465804660,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NTgwNDY2MA==","user":{"login":"bhasudha","id":2179254,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzkyNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179254?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhasudha","html_url":"https://github.com/bhasudha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhasudha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhasudha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhasudha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhasudha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhasudha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhasudha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhasudha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhasudha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhasudha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-20T23:59:15Z","updated_at":"2019-02-20T23:59:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I ensured either the dependencies are relocated in this bundle or are excluded (in which case Presto will bring in these dependencies).
