After all looking at amount of code is not that short. :-)\r\n\r\nIf you would wish to test the logic and make sure that it works with certain kind of packets coming from ADS then the best way would be to utilize driver test suite. This is a XML based descriptor of API operations to executed by PLC4X driver, expected messages sent to transport, messages answered by end device as well as messages sent by PLC. Please have a look at canopen sample:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/plc4x/blob/feature/can-stack-tunning/protocols/canopen/src/test/resources/protocols/canopen/CANOpenDriverSDOIT.xml\r\n(note this is in branch, it is intended to be merged into develop)\r\nThere you can find a test which does several wire operations to confirm that segmentation works fine. Similar thing could be done for ADS driver. Please don't be afraid of lengthily XML.
