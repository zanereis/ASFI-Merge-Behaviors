Thanks for helping to run system tests :)\r\nI could see some failures but looks like they are not related to this change.\r\nHowever, just to make sure whether these failure are just flaky ones or not, can you re-run a test one more time?\r\nAnd/or can you provide a link to more detailed logs like what Json did to me before: https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1707#issuecomment-257615234 , in order to get more insights through reading all logs please?\r\n\r\n@guozhangwang I agree that segment level locking would be enough. However, since the consequence of accessing unmapped object is seriously bad, I tried to be defensive here. It is still not sufficient to prevent all unexpected access to unmapped mmap object, but least it guarantees atomicity on unmapping and cutting further access *through mmap field* after it has invalidated.\r\nLock contention should never happen if everything goes well, since it happens in inside `.delete()` methods which is the last operation performed at the end of  index's life.\r\n\r\n@ijuma I also caught that lucene's issue while I was looking for a replacement for likely going to be deprecated APIs.\r\nAre we already started to adjusting some parts of Kafka code to deal with breaking changes in Java9? If not, I agree that KAFKA-4501 is a proper place to leave a note about this and deal with it once we started working on code adjustment for Java9. I can contribute follow-up patch for this, once KAFKA-4501 started.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/273044404/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/273066024","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2371#issuecomment-273066024","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2371","id":273066024,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MzA2NjAyNA==","user":{"login":"dguy","id":54829,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54829?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dguy","html_url":"https://github.com/dguy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dguy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dguy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dguy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dguy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dguy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dguy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dguy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dguy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dguy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-17T09:36:38Z","updated_at":"2017-01-17T09:36:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@guozhangwang Sure makes sense.

I had a closer look at the SASL documentation and I'm wondering if there's any benefit to the general SASL instructions section for both broker and client. It seems like the mechanism-specific sections include most/all of the steps as well (but are more specific and hence more helpful). The mechanism-specific sections tend to refer back to the general section, but it seems a bit confusing.\r\n\r\nI merged this PR to trunk and 0.10.2, but I think it would be great to restructure the SASL docs so that people just read about the mechanisms that they are interested in and the multi-mechanism section if they need to support multiple ones.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/273120562/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/273120910","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2355#issuecomment-273120910","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2355","id":273120910,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MzEyMDkxMA==","user":{"login":"rajinisivaram","id":13164074,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTY0MDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13164074?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram","html_url":"https://github.com/rajinisivaram","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-17T12:01:10Z","updated_at":"2017-01-17T12:01:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ijuma Thank you for the review.
