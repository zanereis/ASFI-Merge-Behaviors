From the start of design, we decided to make all calls in SchedulerStateManagerAdaptor synchronized  and there might be some miscommunications or other unknown reasons, it is in async style, which is hard to reason and use in Scheduler implementation case.\n2. I checked current scheduler implementations in the repo and fixed the breaking parts. Async interfaces may not be a good idea in SchedulerStateManagerAdaptor: IStateManager is fully async, and we could expose IStateManager from SchedulerStateManagerAdaptor if in future async methods are really needed.\nConsider we are still in an early stage, it is ok to break things rather than keep async version for backward compatibility concern (which may not even exist at current stage).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/209650409/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/209650642","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/342#issuecomment-209650642","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/342","id":209650642,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwOTY1MDY0Mg==","user":{"login":"saileshmittal","id":423065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMzA2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/423065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/saileshmittal","html_url":"https://github.com/saileshmittal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saileshmittal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saileshmittal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saileshmittal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saileshmittal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saileshmittal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saileshmittal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saileshmittal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saileshmittal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saileshmittal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-13T21:17:50Z","updated_at":"2016-04-13T21:17:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"ok
