Have you looked into such a case?\r\n\r\nThanks for your reminder. For the case you mentioned, yes, it's the drawback of the solution but at the same time, it's trade off. There would be same schema creation request submit to meta group but the possibility is small. It only happens if ingestion time series records in the tablet to same storage group fall into different time partition and then different data group.  This means either time partition interval is very small or time range of the tablet is widely which are corner cases. Let me test the cases to make sure things work well.\r\n\r\nThe drawback previous solution is obvious,  `Coordinator` need to wait for the actual execution node complete then to know whether need to create schema then forward insert again which has longer latency. Let the execution node (leader of data group) handle schema creation should be a good trade off.

The basic idea is good, but if you let the DataGroupMembers handle the schema creation and time partitioning is enabled, one tablet may be split into several smaller tablets and they are handled by
