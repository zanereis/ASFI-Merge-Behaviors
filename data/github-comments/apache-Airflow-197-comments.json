The behavior currently in https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4676 is that if a user starts a reverse backfill on a task that depends_on_past, they will still get queued in reverse order but then executed in forward order.  So nothing really breaks but I agree it's misleading.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the implementation currently in this PR is incorrect for that part, in addition to the user confusion Ash mentioned.  The ignore_first_depends_on_past checks explicitly only the start_date's dependency, so when it goes to check the most recent date it will still be blocked and never proceed (see https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4533/files#diff-54a57ccc2c8e73d12c812798bf79ccb2R2177).  You'd probably want to instead add a lookup on the task instance and validate that it's not depends_on_past in the CLI command.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/462020314/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/462023101","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4674#issuecomment-462023101","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4674","id":462023101,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MjAyMzEwMQ==","user":{"login":"ttanay","id":26265392,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY1Mzky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26265392?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanay","html_url":"https://github.com/ttanay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-09T07:50:57Z","updated_at":"2019-02-09T07:50:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Made the changes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/462023101/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/462024314","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4673#issuecomment-462024314","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4673","id":462024314,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MjAyNDMxNA==","user":{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-09T08:12:53Z","updated_at":"2019-02-09T08:12:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@feng-tao I was just referring to a possible situation, even thought it's rare.
