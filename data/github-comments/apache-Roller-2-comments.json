Still, it has to pull its weight. Old projects tend to accumulate dependencies and removing them is always a little bit more difficult than adding new ones. More dependencies mean more maintenance time spent to keep them updated and detect abandoned projects to migrate away from.\r\n\r\nThe red flags here are that this library is only used by a single (small) test, and it is also not convincing to me that it is really necessary for that test.\r\n\r\nHowever the impact is little (and it has no transitive dependencies), so if you really want it, I am ok to merge your changes.

Velocity changes LGTM. Do the Netbeans changes allow you to debug tests in the IDE?\r\n\r\nIts mostly for registering non-standard maven goals. like jetty:run, or the selenium tests which have to specify a path to the \"geckodriver\". Pressing the run/debug button on Roller webapp or the Selenium tests will do the right thing. Debugging junit did actually work before already since netbeans knows how to use that plugin.\r\n\r\nThere is also a \"display-dependency-updates\" action registered for the root project to quickly check if something can be updated.\r\n\r\nI am not feeling strongly about it.
