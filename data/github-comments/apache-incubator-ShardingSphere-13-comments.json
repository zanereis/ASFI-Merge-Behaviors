Please fill all SQL type for your assert.xml to make sure test engine is correct, for example: DQL,DQM,DDL,TCL,DAL\r\n5. Missing some assert at parse context(for example missing condition assert here), please check SQLStatement and his child class to make sure all properties we need to assert.\r\n6.
