One way was that I could add 3 of those in the constructors of each query toolchest and have them instantiate IntervalChunkingQueryRunner directly. IntervalChunkingQueryRunnerDecorator allowed me to do that more cleanly by just adding one thing in query toolchest constructors(also, say, one more thing gets added to IntervalChunkingQueryRunner constructor, then only decorator needs to be updated instead of having to modify all the toolchest constructors)\n\n```\nOr a better thing to say is that most of the other runner decorators are expressed as a titled method to make them a little more descriptive and a little more generic-use. Is there a particular reason this decorator cannot follow that workflow?\n```\n\nCan you further explain the alternative you're suggesting?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/76105651/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/76112763","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1130#issuecomment-76112763","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1130","id":76112763,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2MTEyNzYz","user":{"login":"housejester","id":9088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/housejester","html_url":"https://github.com/housejester","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/housejester/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/housejester/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/housejester/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/housejester/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/housejester/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/housejester/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/housejester/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/housejester/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/housejester/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-26T02:46:00Z","updated_at":"2015-02-26T02:46:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I removed build.sh, and rebased.

The fact that this requires adding a new method which is essentially just specializing on a primitive type makes me wonder if the initial \"extraction fn\" abstraction was correct.\n\nMy first high level thought is wondering if we can invert it so that we pass in something that allows the \"extraction function\" to get the type of value that it wants.  Kinda like the MetricColumnSelectors.  I can't claim to have thought it through all the way, but the thing that immediately jumps out as less than wonderful in what I'm proposing is that it would complicate implementations by making them care about multi-valued columns.  It would also likely negate some of the \"caching\" of extraction values that can be done with dimensions...\n\nAnother option could be changing the interface to take in an Object instead of String.  That would allow an implementation to be passed a `long` instead of a `String`.  Given that we would likely implement these functions on top of JodaTime (doing `new DateTime()`) this would actually enable one function to handle both `String` dimensions and `long` timestamp type things.  It would introduce object creation overhead when using the Time style ones, but maybe that's not the end of the world?\n\nAnyway, I have to run now.  I'm not necessarily done thinking, but going to hit comment so that the seeds of these thoughts can be planted.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/76873475/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/76873725","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/1160#issuecomment-76873725","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1160","id":76873725,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2ODczNzI1","user":{"login":"fjy","id":428325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODMyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy","html_url":"https://github.com/fjy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-03T02:12:48Z","updated_at":"2015-03-03T02:12:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@pdeva Looking at your logs, you've appear to have configured some metrics as dimensions.
