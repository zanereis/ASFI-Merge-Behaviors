We haven't 100% sure why dubbo have this issue, see https://github.com/apache/incubator-skywalking/pull/2064 . @ascrutae You point to dubbo 2064 issue.\r\n\r\nThis is what we found\r\n1. SkyWalking agent will manipulate the dubbo service class, adding `setSkyWalkingDynamicField` and `getSkyWalkingDynamicField`.\r\n1. Dubbo tries to enhanced the classes too, but magically, dubbo core use the class skeleton from Class file, not SkyWalking agent enhanced. This trigger the conflict and exception.\r\n\r\nMy question is, does Dubbo read class file by itself? If yes, then this is a very risky mechanism, all agents have possibilities to manipulate class when classloader loads it. So the class in memory is not as same as in file. You can't depend on this, and should follow the class skeleton from classloader.\r\n\r\nRight now, SkyWalking's patch plugin forces **override** dubbo core to ignore SkyWalking's dynamic methods. It could solve problem for skywalking's users, and that is the best we can do. I hope dubbo team could dive deeper for this, and solve this forever.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/449619152/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/449626590","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/pull/3049#issuecomment-449626590","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3049","id":449626590,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0OTYyNjU5MA==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-23T10:13:33Z","updated_at":"2018-12-23T10:13:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#
