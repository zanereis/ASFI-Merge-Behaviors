the process of modification, I found that 'projectMapper.queryByName(projectName)' was used in 'dolphinscheduler-python/src/main/java/org/apache/dolphinscheduler/server/PythonGatewayServer.java', and I learned the concept of work flow user through 'pydolphinscheduler/src/pydolphinscheduler/core/default_config.yaml'. It was then discovered that user 1's project could be authorized to user 2.\r\n\r\nIf user 1 has an ETL project, and user 2 has an ETL project, and grants user 1's ETL project to user 2, then user 2's project list will have two ETL projects, one from user 1 and one from user 2. The problem is that the PyDolphinScheduler module queries projectCode by projectName and it may not be clear to the PydolphinScheduler user which user the project is from. It may be neither default.user.name nor default.workflow.user in 'pydolphinscheduler/src/pydolphinscheduler/core/default_config.yaml'. So it makes sense that the projectName global is unique in the PyDolphinScheduler module.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1072974732/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1072980172","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/9015#issuecomment-1072980172","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/9015","id":1072980172,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms4_9GDM","user":{"login":"calvinjiang","id":4928204,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MjgyMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4928204?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calvinjiang","html_url":"https://github.com/calvinjiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calvinjiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calvinjiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calvinjiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calvinjiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calvinjiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calvinjiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calvinjiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calvinjiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calvinjiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-19T09:57:48Z","updated_at":"2022-03-19T09:57:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'll

It was then discovered that user 1's project could be authorized to user 2.\r\n> \r\n> If user 1 has an ETL project, and user 2 has an ETL project, and grants user 1's ETL project to user 2, then user 2's project list will have two ETL projects, one from user 1 and one from user 2. The problem is that the PyDolphinScheduler module queries projectCode by projectName and it may not be clear to the PydolphinScheduler user which user the project is from. It may be neither default.user.name nor default.workflow.user in 'pydolphinscheduler/src/pydolphinscheduler/core/default_config.yaml'.
