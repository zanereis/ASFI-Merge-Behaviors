Most of the config that exists in the PR currently is for my testing. I _was_ planning to make it opt-in initially though because I wasn't sure I would get sufficient testing in to be confident enough to make it the default yet, but I went ahead made the change in this branch and have been running all queries (except scan) on a test cluster for a couple days now and so far so good.\r\n\r\nI'm a bit worried about the dumb, greedy, level of parallelism chooser currently in place, I need to perform additional stress testing to try and find where things fall apart. I think my goal here is to not be significantly _worse_ than the current behavior under load, though measuring this sounds .. difficult, so I will see what I can do.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/537802979/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/537860205","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/8571#issuecomment-537860205","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8571","id":537860205,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNzg2MDIwNQ==","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-03T09:12:33Z","updated_at":"2019-10-03T09:12:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ccaominh thank you for the review!
