And tests passed, so I suppose tests do not distinguish cancellation after _default timeout_ vs other possible ways.\r\n\r\n@pavlukhin Thank you for reviewing and sharing feedback. \r\n\r\nIf you note the tests in IgniteCacheDistributedQueryStopOnCancelOrTimeoutSelfTest also, it is similar to Default Query timeout tests. I suppose the reason being we are throwing QueryCancelledException for either manual cancel or query being cancelled due to timeout. I agree throwing a separate exception for timeout vs manual cancel will be better approach to handle different scenarios and help with logging and exception handling.\r\n\r\nI am also thinking if that change can be taken up as separate issue and we can close on default query handling change in this PR.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/comments/546778525/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/comments/546907450","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ignite/pull/7008#issuecomment-546907450","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/7008","id":546907450,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NjkwNzQ1MA==","user":{"login":"kotari4u","id":7362235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNjIyMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7362235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotari4u","html_url":"https://github.com/kotari4u","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotari4u/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotari4u/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotari4u/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotari4u/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotari4u/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotari4u/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotari4u/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotari4u/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotari4u/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-28T11:36:38Z","updated_at":"2019-10-28T11:36:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"https://github.com/apache/ignite/pull/7016\r\nCreated another PR with all the changes at one place.
