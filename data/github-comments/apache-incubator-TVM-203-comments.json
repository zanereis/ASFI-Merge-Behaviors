There is no performance impact. In fact i did not find anything as Hoisting candidate.\r\n> \r\n> ### Hoisting Disabled :\r\n> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32511895/89104943-9dde3a80-d43a-11ea-994d-85e1468c8241.png)\r\n> \r\n> ### Hoisting Enabled:\r\n> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32511895/89104952-b2223780-d43a-11ea-8f92-e7fb4e555115.png)\r\n> \r\n> Hope it helps. Please let me know, if i have mistaken anything. TIA!\r\n\r\nUsually there are two cases which might involve this pass: 1) Loop tiling with non-factor split. 2) Dynamic shape op. If I remember correctly, a conv2d with symbolic batch size will generate an IR with a lot of hoist candidates. Due to the limitation of nvcc, performance for such as kernel is quite terrible and this pass is able to handle this. It would be nice if we can verify this case for GPU and add a unit test.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/667826737/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/667955487","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6195#issuecomment-667955487","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6195","id":667955487,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2Nzk1NTQ4Nw==","user":{"login":"MarisaKirisame","id":3397377,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzOTczNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3397377?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame","html_url":"https://github.com/MarisaKirisame","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-03T10:53:28Z","updated_at":"2020-08-03T10:53:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This

modern compilers,  but the standard said this kind of optimization is **allowed**, not **must**, i am afraid it is not a good way to rely on certain implementations not the standard\r\n\r\n> When certain criteria are met, an implementation is allowed to omit the copy/move construction of a class object, even if the constructor selected for the copy/move operation and/or the destructor for the object have side effects. In such cases, the implementation treats the source and target of the omitted copy/move operation as simply two different ways of referring to the same object, and the destruction of that object occurs at the later of the times when the two objects would have been destroyed without the optimization. This elision of copy/move operations, called copy elision, is permitted in the following circumstances (which may be combined to eliminate multiple copies):\r\n> \r\n> in a return statement in a function with a class return type, when the expression is the name of a non-volatile automatic object (other than a function or catch-clause parameter) with the same cv-unqualified type as the function return type, the copy/move operation can be omitted by constructing the automatic object directly into the function’s return value\r\n> [...]\r\n> when a temporary class object that has not

What I observed that motivated this PR: After the timeout is reached** the RPCActivity view (with the StopRPC button) will close and return to the MainActivity view where the connection fields are listed. After a short time the RPCActivity will automatically restart and the pending measurements will again decrease. This seems to be the desired behavior. \r\n\r\nI can run a few explicit experiments to be sure the thread is terminating, however, unfortunately while this helped stability, after about an hour or two I did see a system reset of similar characteristics as before. The resets are much less frequent than before, but persist. I noted two more uses of System.exit() in the RPCTracker APK which may or may not be causing this
