It seems your breakage is limited mainly here:\r\n\r\n```\r\nprotected String makeProvenanceUrl(final ProcessContext context, String database, FlowFile flowFile) {\r\n    return new StringBuilder(\"influxdb://\")\r\n        .append(context.getProperty(INFLUX_DB_URL).evaluateAttributeExpressions(flowFile).getValue()).append(\"/\")\r\n        .append(database).toString();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou marked that property as `VARIABLE_REGISTRY` and it is failing because you're applying it flowfiles. The existing calls to `expressionLanguageSupported(boolean)` in the abstract class also need to be fixed.\r\n\r\nSo just do a rebase against the latest master and take care of those.

@scottyaslan @markap14 I've addressed the PR feedback above. Please have a look at my most recent commit. A couple notes:\r\n\r\n- I also found and addressed an issue when replicating the terminate threads request throughout the cluster.\r\n- I left the Terminate content menu alone since it replaces the Stop option. Like Start/Stop, I think simply stating the action is sufficient.\r\n- I did not address the formatting of the queue stats. When investigating I discovered an issue with this formatting. It turns out that it is already formatted in the proposed way when in clustered mode. In standalone this formatting is different. Unfortunately, its a bigger change then I'd like to make in this PR. As a result, I filed a new JIRA [1] to address it in the future.\r\n\r\n[1] https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-5067","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/380103316/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/380120183","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2607#issuecomment-380120183","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2607","id":380120183,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MDEyMDE4Mw==","user":{"login":"moranr","id":14202495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjAyNDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14202495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/moranr","html_url":"https://github.com/moranr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moranr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moranr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moranr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moranr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moranr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moranr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moranr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moranr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moranr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-10T14:28:12Z","updated_at":"2018-04-10T14:28:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @mcgilman, looks good.

Post a message when you've force pushed and I'll take a look.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/380781684/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/380781705","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2517#issuecomment-380781705","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2517","id":380781705,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MDc4MTcwNQ==","user":{"login":"JohannesDaniel","id":20088497,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDg4NDk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20088497?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohannesDaniel","html_url":"https://github.com/JohannesDaniel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohannesDaniel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohannesDaniel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohannesDaniel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohannesDaniel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohannesDaniel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohannesDaniel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohannesDaniel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohannesDaniel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohannesDaniel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-12T12:05:00Z","updated_at":"2018-04-12T12:05:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@MikeThomsen or is this a normal thing that the commits of others are shown here after the rebase?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/380781705/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/380782040","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2517#issuecomment-380782040","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2517","id":380782040,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MDc4MjA0MA==","user":{"login":"MikeThomsen","id":108184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODE4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeThomsen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-12T12:06:19Z","updated_at":"2018-04-12T12:06:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@JohannesDaniel nope.

For those parameters that can be set multiple times, I adopted your logic of PutSolrContentStream. These parameters can be added as dynamic properties, e. g. fq.1=field:value and fq.2=field:value. I inserted this method into SolrUtils and adjusted the pattern a little bit (parameters containing dots are also allowed now, e. g. facet.field). However, we could consider to allow even more characters. Currently, only word characters and dots are allowed. The Solr committers highly recommend to name fields only with these characters, but it is not mandatory. Probably, a pattern like \".*\\.\\d+$\" would be more suitable.\r\n- I made it configurable whether the processor only returns top results (for one request in a single flowfile) or full result sets (for multiple requests in multiple flowfiles with rows as batch size). In the latter case, the processor pages through the results. Additionally, the cursor mark for responses is added as attribute, so users principally should be enabled to build their own looping via dataflows.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/380920526/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/380926592","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2517#issuecomment-380926592","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2517","id":380926592,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MDkyNjU5Mg==","user":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-12T19:59:25Z","updated_at":"2018-04-12T19:59:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Are there best practices for handling paging?
