For the \"explore view\" we should use `react-virtualized` (as in SQL Lab).\r\n\r\nAbout SQL Lab, there are a few reasons why a CLI will beat Superset. In non-async mode, the CLI may run a `fetchmany` as opposed to `fetchall` and can start showing rows before the query is done executing. In async mode, there are much more things going on. The whole query gets executed, returned, cached in the results backend, and only then, once the client polls sees that the data is ready, the server will fetch the data from the results backend and return it to the client. Those delay become worse as the size of the dataset grows.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/365090962/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/365091430","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/4407#issuecomment-365091430","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/4407","id":365091430,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NTA5MTQzMA==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-12T22:54:41Z","updated_at":"2018-02-12T22:54:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Which database engine are you querying here?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/365091430/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/365092528","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/4405#issuecomment-365092528","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/4405","id":365092528,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NTA5MjUyOA==","user":{"login":"timifasubaa","id":30888507,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwODg4NTA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30888507?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timifasubaa","html_url":"https://github.com/timifasubaa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timifasubaa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timifasubaa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timifasubaa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timifasubaa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timifasubaa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timifasubaa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timifasubaa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timifasubaa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timifasubaa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-12T22:59:24Z","updated_at":"2018-02-12T23:00:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mistercrunch Done.

@mistercrunch \r\n\r\nAbove is the overall features of this so-called \"column and row configuration\". Actually, we have used superset for almost one year, and designed this feature from bottom up, improve piece by piece, and finally proposed this patch for community.\r\n\r\nThe basic design is:\r\n\r\n- should be a purely frontend implementation based on datatables state save and restore\r\n- put column configuration and row configurations settings to `formData`, just utilize superset's existing tools to save and restore table state\r\n\r\nThere're maybe some issues though:\r\n- store column/row configuration may cause url too long for browsers and backend server, need to adjust existing nginx or some other backend settings to accept long `GET` urls\r\n  - solution: maybe we should switch from `GET` to `POST` for queries to avoid this kind of long url problem?\r\n- frontend performance: when user has complicated settings and big data tables, it really takes some time to render the whole table, need to figure out a way to improve this.\r\n\r\nWe're definitely sure that there should be some improvements over the UI/UX design, to make it more intuitive, so we propose this to community asking some feedback. And we think that this is a good starting point.\r\n\r\nThis feature is mainly designed for dashboard readers, they may be leaders of the team, just glance over multiple dashboard in minutes, and they need colors to mark the most important metrics in a table for them.\r\n\r\nThat's all, thanks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/365168066/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/365168344","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/3416#issuecomment-365168344","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/3416","id":365168344,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NTE2ODM0NA==","user":{"login":"xiaohanyu","id":1164623,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjQ2MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1164623?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaohanyu","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaohanyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaohanyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaohanyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaohanyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaohanyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaohanyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaohanyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaohanyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaohanyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaohanyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-13T06:55:16Z","updated_at":"2018-02-13T06:55:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"HI, all, we have updated lots of screenshots in \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/4394, please vote for us, thanks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/365168344/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/365193700","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/4324#issuecomment-365193700","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/4324","id":365193700,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NTE5MzcwMA==","user":{"login":"villebro","id":33317356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzE3MzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33317356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro","html_url":"https://github.com/villebro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-13T09:01:35Z","updated_at":"2018-02-13T09:01:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Can you post the contents of \"View Query\" on the explore page where you are getting the error message?
