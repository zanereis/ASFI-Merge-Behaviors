Looking at the graph and also brief verification you did with S7 and Modbus it is clear that we have a memory (or other resource) leak within opc ua protocol logic itself.\r\nOne bug which I know is present is connection hanging when authentication token expires, the refresh of token results in no further traffic on the connection. It could be that we keep generating packets, but OPC server do not answer them leading to growth of heap and crash. The default lifetime I saw with some PLCs is somewhere between 1h15m-1h30m (75-90 minutes) which seem to match, but not exactly, graph you have. The first period in your last snapshot, from 13:30 to 14:00 seem stable, leak gets visible from 14:15. Second period is stable just from 16:15 to 16:30. It gets into troubles instantly after that, as the available reclaimed memory is smaller and smaller. \r\n\r\nI did collect some memory dumps with OPC UA simulator, however it did not reveal anything suspicious with few tags.\r\n@christofe-lintermans-actemium can you share how many tags you poll and how subscriptions are divided? I will try to build a reproducer too.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/2050446709/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/2051170186","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/plc4x/issues/1101#issuecomment-2051170186","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/1101","id":2051170186,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBtifa856Ql-K","user":{"login":"qtvbwfn","id":5848026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NDgwMjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5848026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qtvbwfn","html_url":"https://github.com/qtvbwfn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qtvbwfn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qtvbwfn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qtvbwfn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qtvbwfn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qtvbwfn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qtvbwfn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qtvbwfn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qtvbwfn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qtvbwfn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-12T07:23:49Z","updated_at":"2024-04-12T07:23:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"\r\nI previously attempted to address this issue on version 0.10.0, where the main problem resided in OpcuaProtocolLogic.

think the problem might be related to my device getting an IP address that is generally not reachable from the ADS device. So the device has the IP 192.168.23.20 and a netmask for 255.255.255.0 ... my local dialin computer has an address of 192.168.2.6 ... I would probably try to configure the VPN to give my client an IP on the remote network instead of using the VPN tunnel as default gateway.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/2051733187/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/2051820057","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/plc4x/issues/1476#issuecomment-2051820057","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/1476","id":2051820057,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBtifa856TEoZ","user":{"login":"chrisdutz","id":651105,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MTEwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/651105?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdutz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-12T14:00:22Z","updated_at":"2024-04-12T14:00:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"So I just tried connecting to an S7 on an IP address, that doesn't exist and the connection simply failed with \"connection is not possible\".

That's what I use with 0.9.1.\r\nIt's just that right now, in 0.12.0, not all the drivers do so.\r\n\r\nBest example, is the OPCUA one, which you cannot pass PLCValue. It throws an exception like:\r\nException in thread \"main\" org.apache.plc4x.java.api.exceptions.PlcRuntimeException: Expected PlcValue of type NULL but got INT\r\n\r\nIn my use case, I can connect to any type of PLC (supported by PLC4X) via a configuration from a .yaml file.\r\nWe connect to PLC \"x\", get the data and push it on different platformms (RabbitMQ, MQTT, Kafka, SignalR,...) depending on the needs.\r\n\r\nAs of now, I can have a workaround using a \"switch statement\" on the \"driver\" and using the addTagAdress() method appropriatly, but it just feels inconsistent and \"harder\" for newcomers.\r\n\r\nJust my 0.2 cents on the subject :)\r\n\r\nAs always, I really appreciate all the works you guys do on the project. \r\nI love PLC4X and just wish the best for it.\r\n\r\nBest regards","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/2061289706/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
