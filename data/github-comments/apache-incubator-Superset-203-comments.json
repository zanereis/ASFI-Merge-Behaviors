Druid query that I thought were not needed, but if something is missing I'll provide it. It seems now that Druid returns 500, and that the `aggregations` parameter is still empty (while we have configured metrics in the Druid datasources panel).\r\n\r\nI am going to check how to switch from the Druid connector to pydruid's sql alchemy, is it something present in the docs?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/475138187/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/475138728","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/7074#issuecomment-475138728","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/7074","id":475138728,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NTEzODcyOA==","user":{"login":"elukey","id":1536240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzYyNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1536240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elukey","html_url":"https://github.com/elukey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elukey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elukey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elukey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elukey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elukey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elukey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elukey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elukey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elukey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-21T07:56:33Z","updated_at":"2019-03-21T07:56:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ah

wanted to chime in here to recommend consideration of [Git Flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) for the branch/tag/release mechanics. I think it is largely compatible with the broad ideas of SIP-12 described above, but has some benefits:\r\n\r\n- it is very Google-able: [documented](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) by [lots](https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/) of [other](https://yakiloo.com/getting-started-git-flow/) [folks](https://blog.axosoft.com/gitflow/)\r\n- ubiquity: battle-testing and trouble-shooting has been [done](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/gitflow) and [discussed](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=gitflow) by others\r\n- [community](https://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/git-flow/) has built [mature](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) [gitflow](https://github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow-avh) [tooling](https://github.com/petervanderdoes/git-flow-completion) for those who like tools to automate the mechanical bits\r\n\r\nIt also is built around merging and does not include cherry-picking as a matter of course, which keeps history correct and intact. Cherry picks would be rare and used only [when absolutely necessary](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1241720/git-cherry-pick-vs-merge-workflow/1241829#1241829).\r\n\r\n## A nutshell version of what the above SIP-12 process might look like with gitflow:\r\n\r\nNote, gitflow uses a `develop` branch for baseline development rather than `master`, and `master` only contains merge commits from release or hotfix branches.  Every commit on master is a tagged release. (see the linked docs above). This is nice because _CI can automate release mechanics upon merge to master, knowing it is downstream of all release approvals, testing, voting, etc._\r\n\r\n### Daily Development\r\n\r\n1. **Do feature development against develop branch.** Feature, bug-fix, and other \"task\" branches undergo testing in the feature/task branch for approval, get merged into `develop`, which should be as close to releasable as possible at all times (it is the new `master` for CI/CD purposes).\r\n2. **Fix serious non-regression issues (requiring patch in old releases) in the earliest branch that contains them, and merge forward** If a bug is found which existed in one of the prior 2 supported releases, and it is serious enough to require a patch release then fix against the first such release, then upward through later previous releases, release branch (if any exist at the moment), then develop.\r\n\r\n### Releasing\r\n\r\n1. **Cut release branch.** Lots of feature development, bug fixing etc has been going on and merged into `develop`.  Now we cut a `release/1.0.0` branch from `develop` (which is _in an ideal world_ fairly stable already because adequate testing is occuring prior to approving merges into `develop`).\r\n2. **Fix release-blockers on release branch.** No cherry picking. If a regression or new-feature blocking bug is found it is fixed on the `release/1.0.0` branch, then merged into `develop`. If a non-regression bug is identified (ie one that existed in previous releases), it can be fixed in `develop`\r\n3. **Tag and publish release candidates as desired.** This could be automated to be as often as for each fix on release, if `develop` is stable enough going into release that we don't have floods of commits going into the `release` branch.  Obvs that's where we would _like_ to be, but easier said than done.\r\n4. **Approve release** Do the needful things. Convince selves that it is tested. Bugs are fixed. Votes happen etc.\r\n5. **Release**. Merge the `release/1.0.0` branch to master, tag the commit v1.0.0, delete the release branch.\r\n\r\n## A Note about Semver\r\n\r\nI just wanted to note that I've had success in the past using a semver scheme where the \"version\" of a build is automatically generate using a combination of:\r\n1. a major-minor version declaration in source; I used a version.txt file, for ex.. it must be manual since people building the product are the only ones who know when a change is a major/breaking change or a new feature/minor change (both of which would require an update to version.txt), or just a patch release. \r\n2. the output of `git describe --tags`\r\n3. previous tags on the history\r\n\r\nFor example, imagine the repo's most recent release tag is `v1.2.3` (the release.txt file contained `1.2` for major/minor version), and I cut a branch `fixBug1`. If I run `git describe --tags` on that branch with no new commits, it will initially show `v1.2.3`.  If I make one commit, the output would become `v1.2.3-1-a83f0c33`, which is the most recent tag, the number of commits on top of it, and the sha. Tooling can easily compare that to the major/min version in the file and produce a pre-release semver version string of `1.2.4-fixBug1.1.a83f0c33`, which is to say the first commit toward future release `1.2.4` on branch `fixBug` with a sha of `a83f0c33`.\r\n\r\nIf I decided this is a minor version bumper (new feature!), I would modify the `release.txt` file to contain `1.3`.  The tooling could notice that 1.3 is a new minor version on top of git's `v1.2.3-1-a83f0c33` output and generate a pre-release version string of `1.3.0-fixBug.1.a83f0c33`.  Likewise, a major version bump reflexted in version.txt could produce `2.0.0-fixBug.1.a83f0c33`.\r\n\r\nThis sort of version string (which is 100% semver compliant) makes it very easy to go from user-facing version strings to the exact source commit that produced it. This is very useful when trying to reproduce bug fixes or confirm that a deployment actually happened, etc.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/475691949/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/475693158","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/7086#issuecomment-475693158","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/7086","id":475693158,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NTY5MzE1OA==","user":{"login":"khtruong","id":47833996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODMzOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47833996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/khtruong","html_url":"https://github.com/khtruong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khtruong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khtruong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khtruong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khtruong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khtruong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khtruong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khtruong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khtruong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khtruong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-22T16:44:08Z","updated_at":"2019-03-22T16:44:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> wohoo! 🎉\r\n> \r\n> this is super UI nit but can you offset one of these buttons to avoid the `2px` border divider and instead get a `1px` border 😬\r\n> \r\n> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4496521/54800836-3c407600-4c21-11e9-81da-a0a1525ef915.png)\r\n\r\nSure thing!

Currently when a user loads a dashboard, we check if the user has specified \"label_colors\" in JSON metadata (http://superset.apache.org/faq.html#is-there-a-way-to-force-the-use-specific-colors). If it is specified, then we take this color mapping. \r\n\r\n\r\ni.e. The user specifies the following in JSON metadata:\r\n{\r\n    \"label_colors\": {\r\n        \"cat\": \"#0000FF\",\r\n        \"dog\": \"#FFFF00\"\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nWe assign these colors to \"cat\" and \"dog\" first instead of assigning colors by first-come first-server.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the current behavior and is not discoverable unless the user googles how to do this. There is also a subtle bug where this color mapping is associated with the default color scheme \"bnbColors\".\r\n\r\n\r\ni.e: When we load a dashboard, the default namespace is \"GLOBAL\" and the color scheme is ''bnbColors\". If \"label_colors\" is specified, we save this color mapping to the \"GLOBAL\" namespace and color scheme \"bnbColors\". If chart_1 uses the color scheme \"color_scheme_2\", then we will NOT use the \"label_colors\" color mapping even if they have metrics \"cat\" and \"dog\".\r\n\r\n\r\nWith these changes, I leverage \"label_colors\" fully. When a user saves a color scheme, the color scheme and color mapping is saved to JSON metadata (Namespace can be saved but it is not really leveraged at the moment and is not saved unless it is explicitly specified. But this PR sets it up so that namespace can be easily saved in the future). So when the user revisits the dashboard, we load the color scheme and color mapping. All chart's color scheme is overridden with the dashboard color scheme. So we are always looking up the same color scheme and color mapping.\r\n\r\nThe only subtly would be if new data values are introduced when users visit the dashboard. If there are new data values, then there are no colors associated with them saved and there can potentially be inconsistency with those values.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/475721869/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/475722202","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/6131#issuecomment-475722202","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/6131","id":475722202,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NTcyMjIwMg==","user":{"login":"kristw","id":1659771,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTk3NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1659771?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw","html_url":"https://github.com/kristw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-22T18:02:59Z","updated_at":"2019-03-22T18:19:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @DiggidyDave, \r\n\r\nThank you for your comments. When drafting this proposal, @john-bodley, @michellethomas and I did consider **gitflow** and in some aspects it is similar with the process above. However, there are a few differences:\r\n\r\n* You could consider the current `master` as equivalent to `develop` in the **gitflow** paradigm, and there is no equivalent of `master` in gitflow. The stable branch is the release branch of the previous version. We adopted this idea from `react.js` which is also a well-known project. Using `master` as `develop` is more suitable with the current workflow of the folks in the Superset community. \r\n* We also need to maintain *multiple versions* over time. Now we are maintaining the last 2 minor versions. \r\n  * Version `n` is the latest release which include all new features since `n-1` \r\n  * Version `n-1` is considered a stable release. That is why we still add bug fixes (via cherrypick) to it to increase its stability and ensure that the previous version is the most stable one we could have. \r\n\r\nOftentimes we do not want to introduce all new features into the current stable release but rather apply bug fixes to improve its stability and wait for the next minor release to adopt new features. In **gitflow**, once you are at `1.2.3` and create `1.3.0` , it is not natural to create `1.2.4`. Only `1.3.1` is possible. Users either have to choose between `1.2.3` which has a bug or `1.3.1` which include the bug fix but also has new features that they are not ready to take. For the multi-version support we adopt some ideas from `node.js` LTS branches. \r\n\r\nPlease also keep in mind that Superset is a UI project, in which a new feature that does not break the previous version could still greatly affect the user experience. The choice to upgrade from `1.2.3` to `1.2.4` vs `1.3.x` for an organization is not something that can be taken lightly. Sometimes introducing new features require internal communication, etc. to ensure the deployment goes smoothly. Therefore it is important to keep `1.2.x` an option when only bug fixes are needed without pushing everyone to adopt `1.3.x` mainly for the bug fixes. \r\n\r\nAnother key point of this SIP-12 is we also wanted to clarify the details about time frame and set the right expectation for releases, not just the git workflow. These details are organization-specific and not specified in **gitflow**. We research multiple well-known open-source projects such as `node.js` or `Chromium` and see how they have regular cadence for releases and adapt them into this SIP.\r\n\r\nAgain, I appreciate your thoughts and if there are aspects of gitflow that I misunderstood please feel free to discuss more.\r\n\r\n### References\r\n\r\n>**React.js**\r\nBranch Organization\r\nWe will do our best to keep the master branch in good shape, with tests passing at all times. But in order to move fast, we will make API changes that your application might not be compatible with. We recommend that you use the latest stable version of React.\r\n>\r\n> If you send a pull request, please do it against the master branch. We maintain stable branches for major versions separately but we don’t accept pull requests to them directly. Instead, we cherry-pick non-breaking changes from master to the latest stable major version.\r\n>\r\n> Semantic Versioning\r\nReact follows semantic versioning. We release patch versions for bugfixes, minor versions for new features, and major versions for any breaking changes. When we make breaking changes, we also introduce deprecation warnings in a minor version so that our users learn about the upcoming changes and migrate their code in advance.\r\n>\r\n> We tag every pull request with a label marking whether the change should go in the next patch, minor, or a major version. We release new patch versions every few weeks, minor versions every few months, and major versions one or two times a year.\r\n>\r\n> Every significant change is documented in the changelog file.\r\n\r\n> **node.js**\r\nnode has minor and patches regularly ~2 weeks\r\nhttps://github.com/nodejs/node/tags\r\nhttps://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-plan\r\nhttps://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/COLLABORATOR_GUIDE.md#how-does-lts-work\r\n\r\n> What is LTS?\r\nLong Term Support (often referred to as LTS) guarantees application developers a 30-month support cycle with specific versions of Node.js.\r\n>\r\n> How does LTS work?\r\nOnce a Current branch enters LTS, changes in that branch are limited to bug fixes, security updates, possible npm updates, documentation updates, and certain performance improvements that can be demonstrated to not break existing applications. Semver-minor changes are only permitted if required for bug fixes and then only on a case-by-case basis with LTS WG and possibly Technical Steering Committee (TSC) review. Semver-major changes are permitted only if required for security-related fixes.\r\n>\r\n> Once a Current branch moves into Maintenance mode, only critical bugs, critical security fixes, and documentation updates will be permitted.\r\n>\r\n> Landing semver-minor commits in LTS\r\nThe default policy is to not land semver-minor or higher commits in any LTS branch. However, the LTS WG or TSC can evaluate any individual semver-minor commit and decide whether a special exception ought to be made. It is expected that such exceptions would be evaluated, in part, on the scope and impact of the changes on the code, the risk to ecosystem stability incurred by accepting the change, and the expected benefit that landing the commit will have for the ecosystem.\r\n>\r\n> Any Collaborator who feels a semver-minor commit should be landed in an LTS branch should attach the lts-agenda label to the pull request. The LTS WG will discuss the issue and, if necessary, will escalate the issue up to the TSC for further discussion.\r\n>\r\n> How are LTS Branches Managed?\r\nThere are multiple LTS branches, e.g. v8.x and v6.x. Each of these is paired with a staging branch: v8.x-staging and v6.x-staging.\r\n>\r\n> As commits land on the master branch, they are cherry-picked back to each staging branch as appropriate. If the commit applies only to the LTS branch, the PR must be opened against the staging branch. Commits are selectively pulled from the staging branch into the LTS branch only when a release is being prepared and may be pulled into the LTS branch in a different order than they were landed in staging.\r\n>\r\n> Any Collaborator may land commits into a staging branch, but only the release team should land commits into the LTS branch while preparing a new LTS release.\r\n\r\n> **Chromium**\r\n>\r\n> Chromium has predefined release schedule with certain dates that a release branch will be cut and estimated date that the branch will be stable (~2 months after the branch has been cut). \r\nhttps://www.chromium.org/developers/calendar\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/475722202/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/475723445","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/7086#issuecomment-475723445","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/7086","id":475723445,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NTcyMzQ0NQ==","user":{"login":"khtruong","id":47833996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODMzOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47833996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/khtruong","html_url":"https://github.com/khtruong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khtruong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khtruong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khtruong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khtruong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khtruong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khtruong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khtruong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khtruong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khtruong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-22T18:06:20Z","updated_at":"2019-03-22T18:06:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Really happy to see this!\r\n> \r\n> Does this work in conjunction with http://superset.apache.org/faq.html#is-there-a-way-to-force-the-use-specific-colors ?\r\n> \r\n> This is sometimes needed a user may want to see a success metric in green and errors in red.

When a user loads up an old dashboard, then the experience remains the same. They must go and explicitly choose a color scheme to leverage this feature. If they choose a color scheme, when we save the color scheme and color mapping as \"color_scheme\" and \"label_colors\" in the JSON metadata. Now if they choose a color scheme, we may override their previous \"label_colors\" since the old behavior associated \"label_colors\" with the color scheme \"bnbColors\". But they can go and modify this in JSON metadata like before. We also want to allow users to choose their color mapping through a UI but we will tackle that later on. This is the first piece to color consistency.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/475723445/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/475724217","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/7086#issuecomment-475724217","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/7086","id":475724217,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NTcyNDIxNw==","user":{"login":"khtruong","id":47833996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODMzOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47833996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/khtruong","html_url":"https://github.com/khtruong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khtruong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khtruong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khtruong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khtruong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khtruong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khtruong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khtruong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khtruong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khtruong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-22T18:08:29Z","updated_at":"2019-03-22T18:08:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> About @mistercrunch comments, adding color picker at label level, Eli gave me a design at here: #5887.
