That may also need to be revisited.\r\n\r\n- for intermediate stage this should not be true. the runner thread exits when opChain is registered\r\n- for leaf stage, unfortunately not all the combine operators are running on a poll basis so the issue you mentioned could happen (but probably only for the currently concurrent indexed table group-by combine, not the rest which uses queue to poll segment results and will not block/busy-wait)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1448505451/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1448605060","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/10318#issuecomment-1448605060","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/10318","id":1448605060,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5WV_WE","user":{"login":"vvivekiyer","id":21298365,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjk4MzY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21298365?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvivekiyer","html_url":"https://github.com/vvivekiyer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvivekiyer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvivekiyer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvivekiyer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvivekiyer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvivekiyer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvivekiyer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvivekiyer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvivekiyer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvivekiyer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-28T17:46:08Z","updated_at":"2023-02-28T17:46:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Let me do some digging today on Postgres numeric type and Calcite and get back.

These are typically used for financial data.  The precision and scale values determine the number of digits before/after the decimal. \r\n\r\nFor AVG aggregation function, Postgres has the following return type:\r\n\r\n> avg ( smallint ) → numeric\r\n> avg ( integer ) → numeric\r\n> avg ( bigint ) → numeric\r\n> avg ( numeric ) → numeric\r\n> avg ( real ) → double precision\r\n> avg ( double precision ) → double precision\r\n> avg ( interval ) → interval\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the cases where Postgres returns a numeric datatype (for all integer types above), the precision and scale of the result value could be different from the input values. It is calculated based on the input values as follows:\r\n> precision = max(precision(input_values) + ceil(log10(count(input_values))), scale(input_values) + decimal_places) \r\n\r\n\r\n**Pinot: AVG Return Type**\r\n\r\n- I think the closest support we have to variable sized data-types is BIG_DECIMAL. Based on my reading, BIG_DECIMAL can support larger than DOUBLE values, I don't think it can handle exact PRECISION and SCALE during storage. Precision and Scale support is added through specific aggregation functions like SUMPRECISION, etc \r\n\r\n-  Additionally, during the planning stage, we do not have access to the column values. So, we can't  calculate precision/scale values like Postgres does for NUMERIC datatype.\r\n\r\nGiven these 2 limitations above, I'm wondering if it's possible to mimic Postgres behavior. Please let me know if I'm missing something @walterddr @somandal \r\n\r\n\r\nAt the very least, I think we need to change AVG return type to at least handle BIG_DECIMAL instead of returning a blanket double for everything.\r\n\r\n> INT, LONG, FLOAT, DOUBLE -> return DOUBLE\r\n> BIG_DECIMAL -> return BIG_DECIMAL \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1449070682/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1449088044","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/10342#issuecomment-1449088044","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/10342","id":1449088044,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5WX1Qs","user":{"login":"Jackie-Jiang","id":17555551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTU1NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17555551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang","html_url":"https://github.com/Jackie-Jiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-28T23:34:48Z","updated_at":"2023-02-28T23:34:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @Jackie-Jiang : Any concerns in making the zk call?

The fields within IndexLoadingConfig is already a copy of the original config, so it should be okay to modify them.\r\n\r\nIt is mandatory in index-spi, where we assume that index config is always going to be read from a `TableConfig`. What have to do there is different in `IndexLoadingConfig` and `SegmentGeneratorConfig` because they are used in a different way.\r\n\r\nIn `IndexLoadingConfig` case we needed to add a new method that transform the internal state of `IndexLoadingConfig` into a config object. But to know when we need to call that method we introduced a boolean attribute called `dirty` (in index-spi). That attribute is changed whenever a mutator method is called in `IndexLoadingConfig`. This works... unless tests actually modify the mutable collections of private attributes in `IndexLoadingConfig`, breaking the encapsulation. Here we have two options:\r\n- To forbid external mutation of private attributes (which improves the encapsulation)\r\n- To add some _barriers_ in the code. These would be special points when we know that the `IndexLoadingClass` will not be modified again, so we can safely calculate there the index config object  there. This approach is less resilient. If we don't detect one of these _barriers_, then the result is not correct.\r\n\r\nI don't remember exactly why, but in `SegmentGeneratorConfig` we couldn't use these techniques, so instead of doing that, `SegmentGeneratorConfig` uses another technique where each time a mutator method is called, the index config is recalculated. This end up being a cleaner solution, but also a bit more expensive (as it needs to create several objects). I may try to implement this solution in `IndexLoadingConfig` (as suggested in the PEP) but both solutions require to remove the external mutation of internal attributes.\r\n\r\n> Ideally we want to make IndexLoadingConfig directly read config from TableConfig and Schema\r\n\r\nYes. I know, but meanwhile we need a solution to the external mutation problem. This code is already included in index-spi, but I think that it would be better to add it in a different PR in order to:\r\n- Reduce the complexity of index-spi. This feature is something orthogonal to index-spi. We shouldn't break the encapsulation of our objects.\r\n- Forbid new tests created before index-spi is merged to use internal mutability (and therefore make easier to fix conflicts in index-spi).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1449501930/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1449772728","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/10191#issuecomment-1449772728","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/10191","id":1449772728,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5Waca4","user":{"login":"gortiz","id":1913993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MTM5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1913993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz","html_url":"https://github.com/gortiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-01T10:08:56Z","updated_at":"2023-03-01T10:09:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Just realize this is copy-pasted from the class in segment local, but the original IndexHandler is modified recently..\r\nLet's directly move the class to segment spi since there are very few usages of \r\n\r\nI've just checked and there is no recent change in the interface.

Can we always use IndexName? That can avoid a lot of confusion. If you really think we need 2 different names, we can call the internal one getInternalName()\r\n\r\nI don't like having the two concepts either, but I think we need them for compatibility and usability reasons.\r\n\r\nYes, the ids of the literals in `ColumnIndexType` are in upper case and the names are the same value in lower case. But the literals are the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDICTIONARY(\"dictionary\"),\r\n  FORWARD_INDEX(\"forward_index\"),\r\n  INVERTED_INDEX(\"inverted_index\"),\r\n  BLOOM_FILTER(\"bloom_filter\"),\r\n  NULLVALUE_VECTOR(\"nullvalue_vector\"),\r\n  TEXT_INDEX(\"text_index\"),\r\n  FST_INDEX(\"fst_index\"),\r\n  JSON_INDEX(\"json_index\"),\r\n  RANGE_INDEX(\"range_index\"),\r\n  H3_INDEX(\"h3_index\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, all but dictionary and null value have the `_index` suffix.\r\n\r\nIn `index-spi` we have a new concept of _id_ which is the one used to describe the index to the user. We use this _id_ to indicate that something is wrong with an index and the user uses that _id_ to define the config for that specific index. This new concept of _id_ is different than the older one. We don't want the user to write the `_index` suffix everywhere like the following:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n  \"fieldConfigList\": [\r\n    {\r\n       \"name\": “col1”,\r\n       \"indexes\": {\r\n         \"inverted_index\": {\r\n           \"enabled\": true\r\n         },\r\n         \"range_index\": {\r\n           \"enabled\": true\r\n         },\r\n         \"text_index\": {\r\n           \"type\": “lucene”,\r\n           \"enableQueryCacheForTextIndex\": false,\r\n           \"stopWordsInclude\": [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]\r\n         },\r\n         \"bloom_index\": {\r\n           \"fpp\": 0.01,\r\n           \"maxSizeInBytes\": 1000000,\r\n           \"loadOnHeap\": true\r\n          }\r\n       }\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd I think printing errors like `\"there was a problem with index of type \" + indexType` would be quite repetitive if they print `\"there was a problem with index of type bloom_index\"`.\r\n\r\nAt the same time we cannot decide to just remove the `_index` suffix because that literal is used in the segment metadata, so we need to read segments commited with `_index` suffix. And at the same time the suffix is not always there (dictionary and null vector do not add that suffix) so we cannot just create the version with suffix by appending `_index` to the new user-friendly concept of id.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1449801023/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1450023375","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/10361#issuecomment-1450023375","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/10361","id":1450023375,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5WbZnP","user":{"login":"gortiz","id":1913993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MTM5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1913993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz","html_url":"https://github.com/gortiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-01T12:03:32Z","updated_at":"2023-03-01T12:03:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@walterddr: I'm nominating you as reviewer because I know you like visitors ;)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1450023375/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":1,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1450432071","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/10318#issuecomment-1450432071","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/10318","id":1450432071,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5Wc9ZH","user":{"login":"walterddr","id":3581352,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1ODEzNTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3581352?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr","html_url":"https://github.com/walterddr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-01T16:22:34Z","updated_at":"2023-03-01T16:22:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It is possible to mimic Postgres behavior.

Use the formula similar to postgres above. But that's not feasible in Pinot as the planner doesn't have details about table size or # of records.  We also don't store this metadata in TableCache or Zk.\r\n2. As AVG is converted to SUM / Count() , we thought we could use Calcite's deriveDecimalType [here](https://github.com/apache/calcite/blob/2dba40e7a0a5651eac5a30d9e0a72f178bd9bff2/core/src/main/java/org/apache/calcite/rel/type/RelDataTypeSystem.java#L277) to determine the type.

We can discuss whether we want to use other names on methods (maybe not calling them `getId` and `getName`), but forcing users to use these not that friendly names when it is easy to let them use better names is not a good

But I'm sure you can review these changes and try to imagine the impact on Apache Pinot. The code is mostly the same but:\r\n1. We now create two OptionaInt objects.\r\n2. The buffer is stored as a local variable instead of a final attribute.\r\n3. `ScanBasedDocIdIterator.applyAnd(ImmutableRoaringBitmap)` is implemented as a call to the new overloaded method that receives an iterator.\r\n\r\nI would say that 2 should have a positive but negligible impact and given the length of `ScanBasedDocIdIterator.applyAnd(ImmutableRoaringBitmap)` it should always be inlined. About 1, it may have a very low impact, but we can find a way to do not create them if we think it is problematic.\r\n\r\nOur plan is not to provide a better general window size and keep it in the proprietary code but to use optimize an inefficient case we only have in our proprietary plugins. The default 256 value may be great to improve the CPU cache utilization when the data is in main memory and as said, we don't want to change that. But when data has to be fetched using the network, the cost network cost is larger than anything else. In that specific case, larger blocks reduce the number of network calls and significantly increase the performance. Ideally we would like to continue applying windows of size 256 in the calculation part but fetch larger windows and cache them in order to be consumed in windows of 256 values. But that would require to communicate the planning layer with the storage layer. That dependency may make sense, but it would need to do a larger refactor, so we are happy with this intermediate solution right now.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1453113881/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1453122795","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/10361#issuecomment-1453122795","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/10361","id":1453122795,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5WnOTr","user":{"login":"gortiz","id":1913993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MTM5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1913993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz","html_url":"https://github.com/gortiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-03T07:58:51Z","updated_at":"2023-03-03T07:58:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> we dont have a single concrete impl of the visitors in this PR so this PR is merely just a interface addition?\r\n\r\nYes, just the interface in this PR.\r\n\r\n> do we have a concrete usage of this in a follow up PR?\r\n\r\nI'm working on a proprietary extension and I found this pattern would help me in the implementation. I didn't dedicate time trying to look for possible usages in Apache Pinot, but I'm sure we can use these interfaces in code we already wrote. I'm using them to be able to access the `matchingValue` attribute in a safe way without having to create a new method on the class to export it and without doing boxing (although I need to create a new Visitor, so the performance change shouldn't be significant). Alternatively we could just add a `getMatchingValue` (and similar to IN, NEQ and NIN).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1453122795/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1453573271","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/10316#issuecomment-1453573271","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/10316","id":1453573271,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5Wo8SX","user":{"login":"sahoss","id":126167264,"node_id":"U_kgDOB4Uo4A","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/126167264?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahoss","html_url":"https://github.com/sahoss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahoss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahoss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahoss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahoss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahoss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahoss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahoss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahoss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahoss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-03T14:00:12Z","updated_at":"2023-03-03T14:11:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"So
