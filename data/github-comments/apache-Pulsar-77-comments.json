All, thanks for the highlight and discussion.\r\n\r\nYep, @sijie has highlighted at previous review. Container/Pod level port isolation can help to be created for multiple connector instance.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative approach, i was thinking about finding and setting available tcp/udp port under hood in the light of the `parallelism` level. In this case, tcp/udp client(user) needs to know used port(s) to connect to server/connector(s).

So in that sense, people are using DNS of the brokers for the web-service-url and broker-service-url.\r\n\r\nBut pulsar client also use service url to establish a connection and do the topic lookup, does that mean I need to set the url address to the node ip where the pulsar discovery process run? Also, if I need the fault tolerance on the discovery, I need to run several discovery processes and provide an single ip like vip over them.

That was actually due to an attempt to fix the build. \r\n\r\nProblem is we were still building the \"old\" website too as part of the build. The build happens in a Docker container with all the dependencies, though some Ruby dependencies are fetched at build time and, due to some changes in these dependencies, the old-site build script started failing. \r\n\r\nI tried to fix by just building the current website, but the above error is now coming. I'll get to it by tomorrow.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/452184920/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/452204263","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/3326#issuecomment-452204263","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/3326","id":452204263,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MjIwNDI2Mw==","user":{"login":"jerrypeng","id":3613359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTMzNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3613359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng","html_url":"https://github.com/jerrypeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-08T07:46:08Z","updated_at":"2019-01-08T07:46:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@merlimat I have added the tests","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/452204263/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/452273277","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/2880#issuecomment-452273277","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/2880","id":452273277,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MjI3MzI3Nw==","user":{"login":"ivankelly","id":54955,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54955?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly","html_url":"https://github.com/ivankelly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-08T11:56:41Z","updated_at":"2019-01-08T11:56:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@HaraldGustafsson you made the request directly to the REST api, and not through the admin api?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/452273277/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/452276287","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/3320#issuecomment-452276287","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/3320","id":452276287,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MjI3NjI4Nw==","user":{"login":"skyrocknroll","id":426290,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNjI5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/426290?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyrocknroll","html_url":"https://github.com/skyrocknroll","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyrocknroll/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyrocknroll/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyrocknroll/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyrocknroll/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyrocknroll/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyrocknroll/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyrocknroll/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyrocknroll/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyrocknroll/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-08T12:08:19Z","updated_at":"2019-01-08T12:08:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jerrypeng Any pointer would be highly helpful.

The broker does do this automatically, though the bundles may be owned by different brokers, so as part of the rest operation, the broker has to call out to other brokers (even if there are none, it calls out to itself).\r\n\r\nIt uses the admin client, which internally calls the rest api to do this. If authorization is enabled, then this admin client must be configured to authenticate itself with a role which can perform the operation.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/3340/files, where \"brokerClient\" parameters are configured.\r\n\r\nFor TLS, I don't think there's any way around requiring that the brokerClient be configured with a cert for a superuser, since the we can't forward credentials. \r\n\r\nIt should be possible to do something nicer though. With JWT we can just forward the token. Or we could simply allow client local to the broker to have full super user privs, (since they have access to ZK, they do anyhow). Something like an auth plugin which writes a something to zk to auth, and the broker auth provider checks this to authorize the client as the role they are requesting. @jai1 @merlimat WDYT?\r\n\r\nIn any case, I'll close this issue, as its a configuration issue.
