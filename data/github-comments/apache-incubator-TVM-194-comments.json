For example, `feature.cc` includes all utilities we used to extract features, but the use case (XGBoost cost model) is not included yet. Another example is that loop state and transform steps are included in this PR but the search policy isn't. This might cause people hard to imagine how those data structures will be used.\r\n\r\nIf we are going to breakdown this PR, I would suggest putting everything we have to this PR and use this PR as the reference when sending other small PRs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/647849377/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/647854063","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/5826#issuecomment-647854063","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5826","id":647854063,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0Nzg1NDA2Mw==","user":{"login":"jroesch","id":696509,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjUwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/696509?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch","html_url":"https://github.com/jroesch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-23T01:35:29Z","updated_at":"2020-06-23T01:35:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@icemelon9 That was my initial suggestion, I think we reached consensus between TQ, Matt and I that we would introduce dynamic and slowly migrate stuff to use them, then introduce static migrate everything to that, and then finally remove the dynamic prefix inorder to ensure a smooth migration without confusion.
