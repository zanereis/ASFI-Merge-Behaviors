I have been trying really hard to reproduce this bug. I understand your fix, but am also trying to understand how you were able to reproduce this. \r\n\r\nHere's why. \r\nIf I specify a DAG that is missing an owner, the default_owner in airflow.cfg seems to be getting used. If I remove that configuration and retry, somehow, `Airflow`, is still specified as the owner. If I specify `None`, I get an exception that I showed earlier -- the DAG will not even be imported. If I specify `''` (empty string), the UI works as expected. \r\n\r\nIgnoring the fact that I can't reproduce this, I do wonder about your fix. Your fix won't search for dag_id match if the owner field is missing. That does not feel like the right fix. Why not look for a match against both fields, only ignoring the owner field if the owner field is missing.\r\n ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/413058498/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/413058803","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3691#issuecomment-413058803","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3691","id":413058803,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMzA1ODgwMw==","user":{"login":"r39132","id":581734,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MTczNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/581734?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132","html_url":"https://github.com/r39132","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-15T00:35:32Z","updated_at":"2018-08-15T00:35:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@holdenk can you look at @Fokko suggestion, which I interpret as removing the tox from travis.yml but leaving it in setup.py in order to let the tests pass.

Also as it crashed now, please make sure to add a test to ensure that doesn't happen any more in the future.\r\n\r\nI also miss a proper root cause analysis and therefore an approach to the right fix.
