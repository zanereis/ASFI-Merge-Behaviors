I hope some time in the future we can get more and more of a DAG in the database, to make it the single source of truth, with the ultimate goal of having a stateless webserver so we don't have to refresh for minutes after a change.\r\n\r\nSince the change touches various parts of the core of Airflow, I hope some clarification helps this PR:\r\n\r\n- This PR persists task dependencies in a new table `dag_edge`.\r\n- The term \"graph\" is introduced in the code, this contains the structure of a DAG, so the \"edges\" (dependencies) and \"nodes\" (tasks).\r\n- A DagRun is bound to one `graph_id`.\r\n- Currently in Airflow only the latest version of a DAG is displayed in the UI (both graph & tree view). This means if you delete a task, you cannot see runs of that task in the past anymore.\r\n- In the graph view you can now see different graph versions, because we store both tasks and edges.\r\n- For the record: in the tree view you still only the latest version because it is not possible to combine all history into a single view.\r\n\r\nChanges from a user perspective:\r\n- Nothing in the tree view.\r\n- In the graph view, you can now view different \"graphs\" if you change the structure of your DAG. Note the graph view shows DAG runs. If you change your DAG without running it, it does not show in the graph view.\r\n- When you have no DAG runs, there is no graph to show. So, as @ffinfo described above he then reads the graph from the DAG file instead.

Within the `clear_not_launched_queued_tasks` function within `kubernetes_executor.py` a query is sent to kubernetes:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/9a2d998f57b48bcfe07f16a0563293a13141b60e/airflow/contrib/executors/kubernetes_executor.py#L563\r\n\r\nThis returns a set result, which would previously return pods matching the `dag_id` and `task_id` as per the running task within airflow.  However, if (as is the case) this string is above 63 chars, no pods will be returned (as they simply wouldn't have existed to begin with due to this constraint).\r\n\r\nSimply truncating the values would lead to issues in regards to subdags or long named dags/tasks, as you could return multiple pods matching the truncated name (especially in the case of subdag execution) and as such would cause further issues and require more calls to kubernetes to then process this list of multiple pods.\r\n\r\nIf you truncate & slugify the names, you can still hit this condition where multiple pods can be

Thank you for your patience and perseverance!\r\n\r\nSummary of my findings from testing:\r\n\r\n- The \"load from file\" button is gone (which makes the UX much better, IMO)\r\n- This change requires `airflow upgradedb` - we should probably mention that in the docs\r\n- Pre-existing DagRuns are displayed correctly in the Graph View. The default node color for DagRuns which have no graph saved in the DB is white (for all Operator types)\r\n- One thing which is probably not a big deal, but which did pique my curiosity:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsqlite> select id, execution_date, graph_id from dag_run;\r\nid|execution_date|graph_id\r\n1|2019-01-01 00:00:00.000000|\r\n2|2019-01-02 00:00:00.000000|1\r\nsqlite> select distinct graph_id from dag_edge;\r\ngraph_id\r\n0\r\n1\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems like the pre-existing row in `dag_run` has `graph_id=NULL`, but in the `dag_edge` table there is a \"dangling\" entry with `graph_id=0`. Is that expected?\r\n\r\nHere's the script I used to test, in case anyone wants to replicate:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\n\r\nset -euxo pipefail\r\n\r\nAIRFLOW_HOME=\"$HOME/airflow\"\r\nMASTER_HEAD=281e1ace\r\n\r\nmv \"$HOME/airflow/airflow.db\" \"$HOME/airflow/airflow.db.bak\"\r\ngit checkout \"$MASTER_HEAD\"\r\nairflow initdb\r\n\r\n# Create some pre-existing DagRuns\r\nairflow backfill example_bash_operator -s 2019-01-01 -e 2019-01-01\r\n\r\nread -p \"Done backfilling on master branch.

There is already a serialized representation of DAGs so DB serialization should probably go through that even though that might be a bit more work.\r\n2. There is currently a DB call for each DAG in your code, these should be batched as much as possible (just need to be careful that query doesn't get too big). Along this vein probably need to stress test this with a large number of large DAGs and multiply results by appropriate factor if the DB used for testing is local instead of remote to see what performance would be like for real-world usage.\r\n\r\nIn the long run I envision DAG serialization happening on new Airflow clients, which send a request to a new Airflow service which basically serves as a CRUD wrapper around a DB to store both the SimpleDag as well as some kind of reference to some encapsulation of all of the python dependencies for the DAG (e.g. docker image name). This way all 3 of the webserver/worker/scheduler could use the same data model and source of truth. I feel it might make sense to figure out the long term plan first via an AIP and some brainstorming sessions and make sure there is an easy path forward from any intermediate proposals so we don't make our lives harder later undoing changes/figuring out how to do migrations. Security is another thing to keep in mind when thinking about this problem too since this work would be required for multi-tenancy in Airflow.\r\n\r\n@KevinYang21 I know you have been looking at this problem recently as well so curious what you think especially about short term/long term solutions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/467068171/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/467076254","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4742#issuecomment-467076254","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4742","id":467076254,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NzA3NjI1NA==","user":{"login":"jmcarp","id":1633460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzM0NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1633460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp","html_url":"https://github.com/jmcarp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-25T16:23:11Z","updated_at":"2019-02-25T16:23:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ready
