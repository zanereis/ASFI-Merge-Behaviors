not provide information about a specific language or framework. This is not helpful to us.\r\n\r\nIn addition, compared to version 4.x, 5.0 has more support for SQL statements, which is why I ask you if you can try the new version.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/945453783/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/945463513","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/pull/13088#issuecomment-945463513","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/13088","id":945463513,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAvkN_M44WqDZ","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-18T07:55:48Z","updated_at":"2021-10-18T07:55:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/shardingsphere/pull/13088?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) Report\n> Merging [#13088](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/shardingsphere/pull/13088?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (85e22b6) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/shardingsphere/commit/8ed5895be032d8e72cc6c5b1fc56eed5e208a98c?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (8ed5895) will **increase** coverage by `0.00%`.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/shardingsphere/pull/13088/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&height=150&src=pr&token=ZvlXpWa7so&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/shardingsphere/pull/13088?src=pr&el=tree&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation)\n\n```diff\n@@            Coverage Diff            @@\n##             master   #13088   +/-   ##\n=========================================\n  Coverage     63.38%   63.39%           \n  Complexity     1384     1384           \n=========================================\n  Files          2526     2526           \n  Lines         37793    37794    +1     \n  Branches       6503     6503           \n=========================================\n+ Hits          23956    23960    +4     \n+ Misses        11928    11925    -3     \n  Partials       1909     1909           \n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/shardingsphere/pull/13088?src=pr&el=tree&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [...b/protocol/mysql/codec/MySQLPacketCodecEngine.java](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/shardingsphere/pull/13088/diff?src=pr&el=tree&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation#diff-c2hhcmRpbmdzcGhlcmUtZGItcHJvdG9jb2wvc2hhcmRpbmdzcGhlcmUtZGItcHJvdG9jb2wtbXlzcWwvc3JjL21haW4vamF2YS9vcmcvYXBhY2hlL3NoYXJkaW5nc3BoZXJlL2RiL3Byb3RvY29sL215c3FsL2NvZGVjL015U1FMUGFja2V0Q29kZWNFbmdpbmUuamF2YQ==) | `100.00% <0.00%> (+14.28%)` | :arrow_up: |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/shardingsphere/pull/13088?src=pr&el=continue&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `?
