With `SPARK_CONF_DIR` and `HADOOP_CONF_DIR`. \r\n\r\nThe scenario is very simple: in Bright Cluster Manager, users can have many Hadoop instances and many Spark instances. And they're able to connect any of those Spark instances with Yarn of any of those Hadoop instances. If there are many instances, there are many configurations files, and so, they cannot be in the default location, right? We could have a Jupyter/JupyterHub/Toree  deployment (like we do with other tools) per Spark instance. But things are much simpler: we just need to add one `kernel.json` per Spark instance, with different  `SPARK_CONF_DIR` and `HADOOP_CONF_DIR`. If those variables woudn't be there,  all of those `kernel.json` would be identical, and then, how to tell which one to use?\r\n\r\nIndeed, this PR is not really a requirement for us --  during our integration process,  we already update the JSON files to contain those variables,so our user already benefit from the possibility of accessing a Toree kernel per Spark instance.  We are just really trying to give back our 2 cents  for the case there are Toree vanilla users trying to achieve the same without our product.

\r\n1. I was not aware of the `%dataframe` magic. This PR adds a syntactic sugar over `df.head(20)` where both `df` and `df.head` need `%truncation off` to be displayed in `html` format. In practice, I do a lot of `df.show()`s to get sample results which are not pretty printed. Now I know it can be achieved through `%dataframe` but I wonder it would better to display sampled `df` in `html` format by default (without any magic).\r\n\r\n2.
