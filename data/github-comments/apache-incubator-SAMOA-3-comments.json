Here are some notes that I would ask you take into consideration:\n- There are some inherent difficulties compiling gearpump from source. It would be good to have a compiled version to use directly.\n- Assuming this is given (which was my case because @manuzhang provided a compiled version), I managed to get samoa to compile/package with gearpump and run the package.\n- However, it would be good for the adapter to be upgraded to the new version of samoa in incubation, which is 0.5.0. But it should be fairly straightforward. This will allow us to test it with some more generators and ML methods added in the recent past.\n- Feedback when executing VHT:\n  => The engine seems to continue executing the topology long after it has been created, used for the task and finished. Is there any way to pass a signal at the end of the execution to shut it down? (note: not the engine itself, but the topology). It was occupying resources on my computer for no reason at full CPU consumption. I found a manual way to kill it using the command \"gear kill -appid X\" with X being the id of the task, but I wonder if there is a more automatic way.\n  => After I killed the jobs manually, the java processes that were created for the execution (I will assume they are the containers of the topologies) were still alive, just not consuming much resources. Shouldn't they have been terminated and removed? Is there a way to do that?\n  => When I run new tasks, they just keep getting added on the engine (which is logical), even though I had killed the other ones earlier.\n  => Multiple executions of the same experiment with the same seed for the random generator using the parameter -r which should yield the same random tree, perform differently with respect to accuracy. Is that expected?\n  => Using a different seed for the random tree generator (r=1,...,5), the performance of the execution of VHT on local GearPump is fairly low (average over 5 different seeds: 65.39% accuracy) in comparison to running the topology on local Storm (84.046% accuracy). Any explanation why so much reduction in performance?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-samoa/issues/comments/256299469/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-samoa/issues/comments/256330378","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-samoa/pull/54#issuecomment-256330378","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-samoa/issues/54","id":256330378,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NjMzMDM3OA==","user":{"login":"manuzhang","id":1191767,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTE3Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1191767?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang","html_url":"https://github.com/manuzhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-26T12:18:55Z","updated_at":"2016-10-26T12:18:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@nicolas-kourtellis Thanks for the detailed review.

In our case avro mapper works with byte stream received from kafka and the schema is defined in separate file. The other difference is that avro loader produces Instance object while Kafka Mapper was designed to work with InstanceContentEvent. Moreover kafka avro mapper serializes whole InstanceContentEvent object while avro loader reads data file, creates avro structure and, based on that, builds Instance object.It should be possible to use the concept from avro loader for processing kafka but I suppose it would require implementation of new generic loader, instead of using the old one. Other thing is that we need to have two way serialization and avro loader is used only for reading data, not writing.\r\n\r\nAnd regarding JSON parser, as of now it is prepared to parse messages coming from Apache Kafka in \"one-by-one\" style, serializing InstanceContentEvent class. It could be potenatially used to parse file (in line-by-line manner for example), but I believe currently, as the mapper accepts byte array as the input, it can be easily used to this task (i.e. as the parser when reading data from text/json file).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-samoa/issues/comments/309705955/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-samoa/issues/comments/310093503","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-samoa/pull/61#issuecomment-310093503","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-samoa/issues/61","id":310093503,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMDA5MzUwMw==","user":{"login":"nicolas-kourtellis","id":6838775,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4Mzg3NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6838775?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolas-kourtellis","html_url":"https://github.com/nicolas-kourtellis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolas-kourtellis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolas-kourtellis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolas-kourtellis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolas-kourtellis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolas-kourtellis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolas-kourtellis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolas-kourtellis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolas-kourtellis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolas-kourtellis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-21T14:19:57Z","updated_at":"2017-06-21T14:19:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you @mgrzenda for the contribution!

Not such a big deal but please check if there is something you can do to fix it (or if it's something bigger).\r\n- Interestingly, the higher the frequency of predicted labels printed (controlled by -h), the higher the overhead on the execution, and the longer it takes to finish the examples I tried. However, practically when outputing every say 10 instances, the impact is minimal. Any way we can make it impact less the execution time?
