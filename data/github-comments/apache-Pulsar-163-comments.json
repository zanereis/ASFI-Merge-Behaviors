wonder if flush() is intended to do with [batching](https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/en/concepts-messaging/#batching).\r\n\r\nSuppose you enable batching, then:\r\n\r\n1. `send_async()` 50 messages\r\n2. do other stuff\r\n3. `flush()`\r\n\r\nAt the point you do call flush, the batch may or may not have already reached its maximum latency and been sent.  If any messages are still in RAM, presumably flush will send them.  But either way, if flush waits for anything, surely it must wait for *all* messages to be persisted - even if the batch was empty.  If it did nothing when the batch was empty, there would be a race.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/553850869/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/553864130","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/5664#issuecomment-553864130","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/5664","id":553864130,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1Mzg2NDEzMA==","user":{"login":"candlerb","id":44789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0Nzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/candlerb","html_url":"https://github.com/candlerb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/candlerb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/candlerb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/candlerb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/candlerb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/candlerb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/candlerb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/candlerb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/candlerb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/candlerb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-14T12:21:34Z","updated_at":"2019-11-14T12:21:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Identical problems with Go API.
