Except that intersects with the number of tests?\r\n\r\nWhat's the value compared between jobs supposed to communicate independently? i.e. a 20 on unit tests vs. 4 on python dtests means... unit tests are 5x cheaper to run? Or 5x smaller on average than a python dtest? Or do those numbers not actually mean anything independently of the count of tests on their respective jobs?\r\n\r\nIt's non-obvious to me why we'd have a _higher_ cost value for a unit test than a python dtest at face value (i.e. it's only clear once you look at how the calculation is used, and there's not an intuitive relationship between those #'s w/out both test count and that formula...)\r\n\r\nEdit: As I think about this further, there _feels_ like there's redundancy between specified resources:, timeouts for tests, and this designation of cost. Is this something we can / should be calculating based on those factors + test count at runtime? i.e. provide a reference for that in the `.sh` files?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/comments/1673603525/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/comments/1673619426","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/2554#issuecomment-1673619426","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/2554","id":1673619426,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmWM5jwWfi","user":{"login":"jmckenzie-dev","id":6588455,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODg0NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6588455?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmckenzie-dev","html_url":"https://github.com/jmckenzie-dev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmckenzie-dev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmckenzie-dev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmckenzie-dev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmckenzie-dev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmckenzie-dev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmckenzie-dev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmckenzie-dev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmckenzie-dev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmckenzie-dev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-10T17:25:32Z","updated_at":"2023-08-10T17:25:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> <cost talking>\r\nOk. So part of my reaction is the name `cost`; if we rename that to `split_size` I'm a lot more ok with it. But I'd think maybe we revise the calculation to something like:\r\n`num_splits = (test_count / (split_size)) * $AGENT_COUNT_SCALAR`, where `AGENT_COUNT_SCALAR` is a user-provided fudge-factor downstream to indicate that, for a given test, they have N agents they can call up. That'd let people parameterize dialing up and down parallelization based on their unique env (i.e. if you have double the agents that can run a unit test at `medium_executor` vs. what you have available for `large_executor`, having some way to provide that to the scripts / reference system would be nice.\r\n\r\nOR - we could just document that and let the users figure it out. But the num_splits = num_tests / hardcoded_value feels like it gives rise to a hardcoded value that is going to be env-specific.\r\n\r\nSo maybe... hm. We provide the `default_tests_per_split` (or whatever) for each job and document that folks may want to adjust that, and the higher they drive that number the more they can expect the suite to parallelize if agents are available?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/comments/1673619426/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/comments/1673715782","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/2554#issuecomment-1673715782","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/2554","id":1673715782,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmWM5jwuBG","user":{"login":"jmckenzie-dev","id":6588455,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODg0NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6588455?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmckenzie-dev","html_url":"https://github.com/jmckenzie-dev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmckenzie-dev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmckenzie-dev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmckenzie-dev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmckenzie-dev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmckenzie-dev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmckenzie-dev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmckenzie-dev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmckenzie-dev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmckenzie-dev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-10T18:35:07Z","updated_at":"2023-08-10T18:35:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ok,

Also, `assertNotEquals` can actually provide more informative failure messages, as it can include details about the expected and actual values if the assertion fails, making it easier to diagnose and fix the issue. Moreover, the implementation of `assertNotEquals` is also designed to handle a variety of data types, as its implementation typically includes type checks and appropriate comparison logic to determine if the values or objects are unequal, regardless of their types, unlike `assertFalse`, which typically relies on the `equals()` method of the objects being compared.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/comments/1692597281/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/comments/1694331061","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/2634#issuecomment-1694331061","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/2634","id":1694331061,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmWM5k_XC1","user":{"login":"dchenbecker","id":24858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchenbecker","html_url":"https://github.com/dchenbecker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchenbecker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchenbecker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchenbecker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchenbecker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchenbecker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchenbecker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchenbecker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchenbecker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchenbecker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-26T12:31:23Z","updated_at":"2023-08-26T12:31:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Unit
