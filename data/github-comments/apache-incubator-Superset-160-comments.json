Thank you for all the good comments! Here are my explanations:\r\n\r\n- Keep an `id: [key]` property is a good practice for `normalized redux state`: https://redux.js.org/recipes/structuringreducers/normalizingstateshape. It did duplicate the entry key, but it gives us a lot of convenience when access/traverse the data itself.\r\n\r\n- Encode `type` information in `id` property is optional, i still want `type` as a mandatory property. Currently `id` has type information, but it is optional (for easier debug). In the worst case we can remove type from id. But most of code won't affected since we have `type` mandatory property.\r\n\r\n- remove `children:[]` from leave node is a good idea, but it also involved both frontend JS and more complicated migration code. I also feel in our code base we assume `children` property is required for all nodes. it required a lot tests before we can remove it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/410020328/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/410027263","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/5487#issuecomment-410027263","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/5487","id":410027263,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMDAyNzI2Mw==","user":{"login":"villebro","id":33317356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzE3MzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33317356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro","html_url":"https://github.com/villebro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-02T18:39:54Z","updated_at":"2018-08-02T18:39:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@mistercrunch Rebased and ready to merge again. `py36-sqlite` CI failure seems to be a technicality:\r\n\r\n```\r\nNo output has been received in the last 10m0s, this potentially indicates a stalled build or something wrong with the build itself.\r\n\r\nCheck the details on how to adjust your build configuration on: https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/common-build-problems/#Build-times-out-because-no-output-was-received\r\n\r\nThe build has been terminated\r\n``` ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/410027263/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/410065136","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/347#issuecomment-410065136","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/347","id":410065136,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMDA2NTEzNg==","user":{"login":"beankylla","id":13024650,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDI0NjUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13024650?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beankylla","html_url":"https://github.com/beankylla","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beankylla/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beankylla/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beankylla/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beankylla/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beankylla/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beankylla/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beankylla/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beankylla/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beankylla/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-02T20:55:38Z","updated_at":"2018-08-02T20:55:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"+10!

The assumption that a metric is an aggregate function runs deep in Superset. The clear and easy workaround is to use a dummy aggregation function. min, max, sum should all provide the same answer in cases where dimension combinations are unique in the source data. The downside is a bit more work on the database side. Note that in some cases that can hurt quite a bit. For example for geospatial data visualizations where hundreds of thousands of data points can be surfaced, grouping by lat&long is expensive and often unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe committers have had lengthy conversations about this, and the key may be something around the `MetricsControl` allowing users to specify not to aggregate. It may have to be coupled with validation/assertions on resulting dataframes making sure that dimension combinations are not duplicated in some cases, as that may cause problems with some of the visualizations.\r\n\r\nI don't see this work getting prioritized anytime soon though as the work would be complex and there are clear easy workarounds.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/410773587/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/410776243","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/5570#issuecomment-410776243","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/5570","id":410776243,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMDc3NjI0Mw==","user":{"login":"DavidJHassan","id":1705367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDUzNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1705367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidJHassan","html_url":"https://github.com/DavidJHassan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidJHassan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidJHassan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidJHassan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidJHassan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidJHassan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidJHassan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidJHassan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidJHassan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidJHassan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-06T16:57:04Z","updated_at":"2018-08-06T16:57:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mistercrunch I have been using AVG or SUM as my dummy aggregations.
