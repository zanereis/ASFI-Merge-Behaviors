If we do not want to store `State`s, I think we will be forced to either drop checkpointing of partial matches or implement logic of translating them to newly constructed graph of states, which I think would be hard if possible at all.\r\n\r\n2.

@zentol , thanks for taking time for reviewing :)\r\n\r\nIt was my original thought. \r\nHowever turns out due to `Scala` supports `default value` in parameters, in order to achieve same behaviour as Java, adding a new method is not working here.\r\n\r\n This is what currently Java has:\r\n\r\n    1. createLocalEnvironment()\r\n    2. createLocalEnvironment(Int)\r\n    3. createLocalEnvironment(Int, Configuration)\r\n\r\nBefore this PR, in Scala we have:\r\n\r\n    createLocalEnvironment(Int = defaultValue)\r\n\r\nSo a Scala user can access this method by `createLocalEnvironment()` or `createLocalEnvironment(someValue)`.\r\n\r\nIf I add another method `createLocalEnvironment(Int = defaultValue, conf = defaultValue)`, compiler will complain because at this moment `createLocalEnvironment(someValue)` is ambiguous.\r\n\r\nMy opinion is by just adding a parameter with default value to existing method, it doesn't change the existing way to access the method. In addition, Scala user can choose to use default values or override any one of them. \r\n\r\nThere is also a test in `org.apache.flink.streaming.api.scala.DataStreamTest#testParallelism()` to make sure that the existing method is working fine.\r\n\r\nHow do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/310889599/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/310896459","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4175#issuecomment-310896459","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4175","id":310896459,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMDg5NjQ1OQ==","user":{"login":"greghogan","id":569655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2OTY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/569655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan","html_url":"https://github.com/greghogan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-25T11:07:33Z","updated_at":"2017-06-25T11:07:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Why do we have both `flink-docs-master` and `flink-docs-release-1.4`?

Nice work! \r\n\r\nI have some changes to propose in the code itself, but before moving on with this, I have some questions about the need of the change. \r\n\r\nFor the second, I have commented on the JIRA (FLINK-6939) and it would be nice to finish the discussion there first, before checking the following comments.\r\n\r\nNow for the comments on the code I would suggest the following:\r\n\r\n1) Remove the `TransitionInfo` from the `ConditionRegistry` and replace it with the `StateTransition<T>`, as the `TransitionInfo` is just a copy of the state transition. Also make the\r\n`ConditionRegistry`, `ConditionRegistry<T>`.\r\n2)  Pass the `ConditionRegistry` to the `State` itself in the constructor. This will simplify all the changes of the `addStateTransition()`, `addProceed()`... as they do not need the registry as an additional argument anymore.\r\n3) If we agree to keep the `RichIterativeFunction`, then we should probably think if we can remove the non-rich `IterativeCondition` (although this is optional).\r\n\r\nFor these changes, I have a branch where I tested them a bit. Some of my comments are on `TODO`s inside the code. Of course feel free to make the code nicer, and also tell me if I did any change that does not seem reasonable to you. This branch was just a fast testing branch on my side. You can find it here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/kl0u/flink/tree/cep-iter-pr\r\n\r\nAgain thanks a lot for the work and I am looking forward to you comments!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/310919515/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/310965953","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4026#issuecomment-310965953","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4026","id":310965953,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMDk2NTk1Mw==","user":{"login":"tzulitai","id":5284370,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODQzNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5284370?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai","html_url":"https://github.com/tzulitai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-26T05:19:00Z","updated_at":"2017-06-26T05:19:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@zentol there was a recent offline discussion regarding the savepoint formats that will probably void this change.

@dianfu , this branch seems to be broken. Most of the migration tests fail when you run them locally. In addition, from a first look at the PR, I would suggest the following:\r\n\r\n1) the `metaStates` fields in the `NFA` and the `NFASerializer` should be declared `transient` as they are not serializable.\r\n\r\n2) `ComputationState` should also override `hashCode`.\r\n\r\n3) Now the `updateNFA` checks if the state of the `NFA` has changed, and only then it updates the state. This change is orthogonal to the JIRA of the PR and should have a separate JIRA, with its own commit and its own tests in the `CEPOperatorTest`. I created also the JIRA for this: \r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-7008\r\n\r\nI will keep on checking out the branch, to see the general idea of the change because this may give some ideas on how to handle the `IterativeCondition`s in this PR https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4145 .","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/311128810/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
