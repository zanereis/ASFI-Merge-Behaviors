@yanxinyi One thing to keep in mind is, this requires a schema change for SYSTEM.CATALOG, so we should handle this in the `upgradeSystemTables` path as well.\r\nThis will be mandatory since this

A \"SELECT COUNT(*)\" statement is compiled to an aggregate plan. Before this JIRA, I was generating an aggregate plan using this select statement. This plan uses regular scan. Turning this scan into raw scan did not work as the filter set on the scan for this aggregate plan was not compatible with raw scans. So, I hacked it by using \"\"SELECT *\" and setting scan.setAttribute(BaseScannerRegionObserver.UNGROUPED_AGG, TRUE_BYTES).\r\nThis worked with raw scan but caused permission IT failures. I tried to find out the reason for this failure but it was not obvious. So then I followed exactly what MetaDataRegionObserver for partial rebuilds which also uses PostDDLCompiler and raw scan. In a way, we have better unification between partial rebuilds and full rebuilds now. Actually, this was my very first patch that I posted. However, it was more involved than what I wanted (or thought so) and I removed it and came up with the first one you reviewed.

IndexScrutinyMapperForTest is really test code, inheriting from EnvironmentEdge, but is in production code, so 5677 converted it over to use EnvironmentEdgeManger incorrectly, causing infinite recursion. \r\n\r\n2. PartialIndexRebuilderIT has a strange test, testIndexActiveIfRegionMovesWhileRebuilding, which was apparently passing before these changes but is failing now. It's multi-threaded, delicately pieced together using both Thread sleeps AND the edge manager. More importantly, it seems to be asserting something incorrect: that the partial rebuilder should succeed and make a disabled (old-style) index ACTIVE even if a region gets unassigned (and not re-assigned) in the middle of the rebuild run. But then the MR job should fail and the index shouldn't be reactivated. So since I don't understand the purpose of the test, I've gone ahead and removed it. If someone sees a valid use case to test there, please let me know and I'll try again to make it work. \r\n\r\nThese would have been caught pre-commit, but the Jenkins job was broken for a few days
