During updating the (potentially) broken test, one question arose: **is there any list of properties that should not be unset?** If there are, it seems like we have to implement an additional feature to make them unset-proof. (for example, show error message when the user tries to unset some reserved properties.) Do you have any opinion on that? Or, is it better to query about this problem on dev mailing list?\n2.

Here are my answers. \n1. Basically, table properties are used for optional settings per table. So, every table property is optional, and tajo should be able to work with default property values if they are absent. \n   However, among table properties, timezone is recently changed as a mandatory property of a table. So, currently I think it is the only one which should not be removed. \n   The best solution seems to store the timezone value in the TableMeta or TableDesc instead of in the optional KeyValue set. But this would be better to be done in a separate ticket, and it would be enough to force timezone as unsettable here. \n2. The deprecated one is HCatalogStore, and HiveCatalogStore should be implemented. But, as you see, many functions of HiveCatalogStore are not implemented yet. I think it also would be better to do in a separate ticket. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/230673810/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/230689929","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/1036#issuecomment-230689929","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/1036","id":230689929,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMDY4OTkyOQ==","user":{"login":"dongjinleekr","id":2375128,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNzUxMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2375128?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjinleekr","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjinleekr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjinleekr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjinleekr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjinleekr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjinleekr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjinleekr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjinleekr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjinleekr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjinleekr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjinleekr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-06T06:42:43Z","updated_at":"2016-07-06T13:47:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Oh, my mistake.

Some of them are from this discussion, and the others are what I found during this work. (I think it is better to implement disabling unset timezone feature on separate issue, not here.)\n1. [Major] Move timezone property from KeyValue set and disable to unset it. (Related: [TAJO-1185](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TAJO-1185), [TAJO-1241](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TAJO-1241))\n2. [Major, Umbrella] Implement missing HiveCatalogStore features.\n3. [Trivial] Remove AlterTableNode#clone - it has been commented out.\n\nIf you have any opinion, don't hesitate to comment to me. If you merge and close this request without any comments, I will regard it you accepted my proposal.
