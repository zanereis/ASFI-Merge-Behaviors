For example, `addVertices` receives a `DataSet` of vertices to add, but a `List` of edges, `addEdges` receives two datasets...\n- do we really need two `addEdges` methods? If I understand correctly, the second `addEdges` method is to be used when the new edges connect existing vertices? What will (should) happen if there are edges with invalid ids (not in the vertex set)?\n- could we maybe have only `addVertices`, `removeVertices`, `addEdges` etc. methods to cover also the single addition/deletion cases?\n- the remove methods implementations can be simplified by using a single coGroup: if only the first group (existing vertices) contains an element you keep it, otherwise if both groups contain it you remove it (you are actually emulating this with the tag+union+reduce :)).\n\nWhat do you

for your feedback.\n\n> You introduce a separate session ID here. Why not use the JobID as the session ID? This is how the logic in the JobManager (that attaches the graphs) currently works. Is there any limitation with that approach that requires to introduce the new ID?\n\nHaving two ids, `JobID` and the `SessionID`, gives us the possibility to submit multiple independent job graphs in one session. Maybe that's a bit of an overkill since we can already attach multiple independent branches to one job graph. \n\n> You schedule the removeJob() call after job is done. Does that mean the job will be removed after that time, even if new activity on that job happens?\n\nCurrently, that is the case but this will change once we support to resume or extend jobs. In this case, we can cancel the timer that removes the job.\n\n> The Client is bound to a session now. Should we tie it strictly to a session, meaning it has to be initialized with a JobID, or lazily pick up the session. What happens if you submit a JobGraph that comes from a different session? Does it track multiple sessions then?\n\nThe Client is bound to a session if the `sessionID` is set, otherwise it defaults to null and the job manager removes the job immediately after it has finished. I guess this is the kind of lazy pick up you mentioned. It has the advantage that the session management is optional. The job manager tracks multiple sessions. For each session it currently accepts multiple job graphs. Like you suggested that might be unnecessary and we can just move to one job graph per session.\n\n> The LocalExecutor used in the LocalExecutionEnvironment should probably allow you to maintain sessions as well. It would need to be started on the first execution and stopped when the environment terminates the session or runs out of scope.\n\nYes, I didn't add anything there but you're right that it is a valid use even for local executions.\n\n> I think it makes a lot of sense to automatically terminate sessions as soon as the environment or the executor runs out of scope (becomes finalizable or garbage collectible).\n\nWe can probably implement this by overriding the `finalize()` method of the `ExecutionEnvironment` class.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/103833918/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/103842766","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/521#issuecomment-103842766","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/521","id":103842766,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwMzg0Mjc2Ng==","user":{"login":"szape","id":8025879,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMjU4Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8025879?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szape","html_url":"https://github.com/szape","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szape/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szape/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szape/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szape/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szape/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szape/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szape/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szape/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szape/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-20T10:57:42Z","updated_at":"2015-05-20T10:57:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you Robert.

You cannot perform this operation on a DataSet as far as I know, at least not yet! I'm open to suggestions.\n- the extra addEdges method was just an \"experiment\" it's not really needed. I removed it!\n- addVertices can easily cover the addVertex case, however, I believe we should have both methods because there are situations (see IncrementalSSSP) when a user would like to detele a single vertex/edge. He/she will receive the src/target/value as a parameter. Then instead of just calling addEdge(), he/she will need to create a DataSet from the input. Sure, it's not rocket science, but why force the user to perform an extra step, when we have the power to do that for him/her?\n- finally, for the remove methods, coGroup was my first idea but then I thought: \"hey, I could try to make this faster\" :)). I updated the functions!\n\nTell me what you think!

That's why a setter for setting the `JobID` at the `JobGraph` was necessary. It is ensured that the `JobID` can never be set to null. Job graphs which are instantiated manually, still generate a random `JobID` which does not depend on the session.\n- A session timeout has been introduced that specifies the life span of a session. A timeout of zero implies immediate termination of the session after the job has been completed. Otherwise the `ExecutionGraph` is kept for the specified number of seconds.\n- The methods `startNewSession()` and `setSessionTimeout(timeout)` have been added to the `ExecutionEnvironment`.\n- The method `endSession()` has been added to the `Client` which is invoked through the `RemoteExecutor` or the `ContextEnvironment`.\n- The `LocalExecutor` has been modified to respect the session, i.e. it does not shut down the Flink cluster it creates after execution when a session timeout >0 has been specified. In case a new session is invoked through the `LocalEnvironment`, a new LocalExecutor is created.\n- The `finalize()` and a shutdown hook try to end the session when the `ExecutionEnvironment` gets garbage collected or the JVM is shut down.\n\nI'm missing integration tests for the `RemoteEnvironment` and `LocalEnvironment` but there is not much to test at the moment.

When would one end up with a DataSet of vertices, but just a list of Edges (given that edges are usually more than vertices)? On the other hand, we have to deal with the empty edge case as you said. Actually, I think that `addVertex` / `addVertices` shouldn't deal with the edges at all -- having an argument for edges kind of implies that we're checking that these edges belong to the vertex/vertices to be added.. which we don't.\n\nLet me propose the following:\n- regarding additions: when we have DataSets, simply use `union`.  `addVertex` adds a single vertex and `addVertices` adds a list of vertices to the graph (no edges as an argument). `addEdge` and `addEdges` work the same way: single edge and list of edges. The only thing we need to decide here is the behavior when adding an edge for a non-existing vertex. We can either ignore the edge or create it with some default value.\n- regarding removals: I propose we add a `difference` method, corresponding to `union`, which will work on DataSets. Methods for removing vertices and edges will work on single objects and lists.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/105014574/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/105028293","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/720#issuecomment-105028293","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/720","id":105028293,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwNTAyODI5Mw==","user":{"login":"ajaybhat","id":4291728,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTE3Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4291728?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajaybhat","html_url":"https://github.com/ajaybhat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajaybhat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajaybhat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajaybhat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajaybhat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajaybhat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajaybhat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajaybhat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajaybhat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajaybhat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-24T15:42:42Z","updated_at":"2015-05-24T15:43:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> please do not merge my commit on the delta policies as it is already in. :)\n\nI don't know how that happened.
