This is a concern in general and doesn't seem specific to this PR. Assuming users don't specify `use_index`, we depend on the query planner to select an appropriate index and it should be the case that the only indexes which can change the results are partial indexes. Indexes that are not usable for the query are excluded from the set of candidate indexes, so the fallback is safe so long as the text indexes correctly exclude themselves.\r\n\r\n2. I think this points to a general weakness around index management for Query. Ideally it would be safe to add and remove indexes in production databases whilst only impacting performance. Unfortunately, the query planner doesn't take the index state into account, so if an index is added to a production database and it takes some time to build, the query planner would use it and time out. Again, I'm not really sure that's a concern specific to this PR, but one that should be addressed independently.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/342808251/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/342843382","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/972#issuecomment-342843382","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/972","id":342843382,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0Mjg0MzM4Mg==","user":{"login":"CristianG540","id":1929796,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Mjk3OTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1929796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CristianG540","html_url":"https://github.com/CristianG540","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CristianG540/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CristianG540/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CristianG540/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CristianG540/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CristianG540/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CristianG540/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CristianG540/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CristianG540/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CristianG540/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-08T15:00:22Z","updated_at":"2017-11-08T15:00:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"i'm having this error and i think is related with this issue \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1929796/32555755-9efa4ad0-c46b-11e7-95ec-4c154966846b.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/342843382/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/342862693","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/972#issuecomment-342862693","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/972","id":342862693,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0Mjg2MjY5Mw==","user":{"login":"MtDalPizzol","id":3843774,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDM3NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3843774?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MtDalPizzol","html_url":"https://github.com/MtDalPizzol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MtDalPizzol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MtDalPizzol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MtDalPizzol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MtDalPizzol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MtDalPizzol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MtDalPizzol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MtDalPizzol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MtDalPizzol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MtDalPizzol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-08T15:59:29Z","updated_at":"2017-11-08T16:08:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Already updated **vm.args** and still facing this.

You will want to ensure at the very least that your data directory (`/opt/bitnami/couchdb/var/lib/couchdb` per above) is on such a volume. You can also improve throughput by not logging to the local node, and instead using [syslog to stream the logs to a separate logging server](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/blob/master/rel/overlay/etc/default.ini#L548-L556). \r\n\r\nCouchDB is a high-performance product expecting to run on best available hardware.

The default value in your configuration is 8, so that means your 1300 databases actually correspond to 10400 unique shard files. The `max_dbs_open` value actually controls the number of concurrently open shard files, so it may be that you're still asking the process that manages the list of open databases to do a lot of work to keep at most 5000 of them open.\r\n\r\nIf your database count is going to hold steady at 1300 I would look at increasing the limit again. If you are going to keep creating new databases you probably want to be using a smaller value for `[cluster] q`. The small databases probably don't need to be sharded and so you can just set that to 1.
