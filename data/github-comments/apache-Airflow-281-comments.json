I think I like it best between the Base Date and the graph so it's under where one selects the run. Below the graph seems a little too out of sight (I think generally very relevant info if one is setting `conf`), but does avoid putting the graph out of initial view if there's a large conf (although `doc_md` would have this same issue anyways).  Updated, but open for feedback.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2019-12-12 10 36 10](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1597448/70739231-39b01000-1ccb-11ea-8d45-e1e86b5fb3e1.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n> This should not be stored/viewed in the Graph View! I am fine with having this in Details page or somwhere else\r\n\r\nThe details page is at the DAG level. Since the `conf` value is tied to a specific DagRun, I assume it should only land on a page that displays things at a per DagRun level? I think the only alternative (or perhaps show in both) is the Tree View, which I think a big `conf` blobs is too much for the DAG hover over, but maybe could put it in the modal?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/565130713/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/565150765","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6799#issuecomment-565150765","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6799","id":565150765,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NTE1MDc2NQ==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-12T19:30:40Z","updated_at":"2019-12-20T10:16:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#

I think I like it best between the Base Date and the graph so it's under where one selects the run. Below the graph seems a little too out of sight (I think generally very relevant info if one is setting `conf`), but does avoid putting the graph out of initial view if there's a large conf (although `doc_md` would have this same issue anyways). Updated, but open for feedback.\r\n> \r\n> ![Screenshot 2019-12-12 10 36 10](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1597448/70739231-39b01000-1ccb-11ea-8d45-e1e86b5fb3e1.png)\r\n> \r\n> > This should not be stored/viewed in the Graph View! I am fine with having this in Details page or somwhere else\r\n> \r\n> The details page is at the DAG level. Since the `conf` value is tied to a specific DagRun, I assume it should only land on a page that displays things at a per DagRun level? I think the only alternative (or perhaps show in both) is the Tree View, which I think a big `conf` blobs is too much for the DAG hover over, but maybe could put it in the modal?\r\n\r\nHmm, I agree that it won't make sense on the Details page.

But I feel there's a difference here, where an options is explicitly decided upon by Airflow.

In this case, Airflow isn't working due to Airflow overriding a default value.\r\n\r\nThat said, I feel overriding the limits to something sensible (like 2x the requests) is a good course of action. It'll make for saner defaults, the sidecar is granted limited resources, it'll never request an unreasonable amount of memory, and most importantly, you won't have to revert the PR.\r\n\r\nWe run Airflow (webserver etc) on k8s in EKS, and use both the k8s executor and operator to spawn workers on the same cluster.

Maybe they _also_ have to have them in `.env` file if they also use docker. maybe other folks manage `airflow connections -a` scripts.\r\nthis change could eliminate all of that by centralizing creds storage and allowing developers to pull from the same source.  depending on the service, creds could potentially be versioned.  creds changes would be synchronized for everyone.  \r\n\r\ndo you think this needs an AIP?  if so can i have access to create (apache jira username is dstandish)?\r\n\r\ndo you have any feedback on current structure?  i understand that exactly _how_ we do this is probably more controversial than the general idea of opening up creds sourcing.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/565763910/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/565816371","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6822#issuecomment-565816371","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6822","id":565816371,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NTgxNjM3MQ==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-15T14:51:51Z","updated_at":"2019-12-16T12:37:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6822?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#6822](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6822?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/commit/1006740aa92d584cfb0317c922184ef758bf108a?src=pr&el=desc) will **decrease** coverage by `0.3%`.\n> The diff coverage is `85.71%`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6822/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=WdLKlKHOAU&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6822?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@            Coverage Diff            @@\n##           master   #6822      +/-   ##\n=========================================\n- Coverage   84.61%   84.3%   -0.31%     \n=========================================\n  Files         676     676              \n  Lines       38335   38340       +5     \n=========================================\n- Hits        32436   32322     -114     \n- Misses       5899    6018     +119\n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6822?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [airflow/hooks/presto\\_hook.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6822/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9ob29rcy9wcmVzdG9faG9vay5weQ==) | `75.92% <85.71%> (-1.63%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [airflow/kubernetes/volume\\_mount.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6822/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9rdWJlcm5ldGVzL3ZvbHVtZV9tb3VudC5weQ==) | `44.44% <0%> (-55.56%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [airflow/kubernetes/volume.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6822/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9rdWJlcm5ldGVzL3ZvbHVtZS5weQ==) | `52.94% <0%> (-47.06%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [airflow/kubernetes/pod\\_launcher.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6822/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9rdWJlcm5ldGVzL3BvZF9sYXVuY2hlci5weQ==) | `45.25% <0%> (-46.72%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [airflow/kubernetes/refresh\\_config.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6822/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9rdWJlcm5ldGVzL3JlZnJlc2hfY29uZmlnLnB5) | `50.98% <0%> (-23.53%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [...rflow/contrib/operators/kubernetes\\_pod\\_operator.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6822/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9jb250cmliL29wZXJhdG9ycy9rdWJlcm5ldGVzX3BvZF9vcGVyYXRvci5weQ==) | `78.2% <0%> (-20.52%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [airflow/jobs/backfill\\_job.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6822/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9qb2JzL2JhY2tmaWxsX2pvYi5weQ==) | `90.43% <0%> (-1.45%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [airflow/utils/dag\\_processing.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6822/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy91dGlscy9kYWdfcHJvY2Vzc2luZy5weQ==) | `87.42% <0%> (-0.39%)` | :arrow_down: |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6822?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `?

have some doubts about that one.\r\n\r\nWhile I understand where it comes from, it has a number of drawbacks:\r\n\r\n* the scripts should work the same way from all the entities that can run it (webserver, scheduler, workers) - with env variables you just need to make sure that they are set the same way, here you also likely have to set some authentication mechanism on all those entities or embed the credentials to read the credentials in the command itself.\r\n* it's security by obscurity. Once you have access to read the variables, and you can start/stop airflow or run airflow CLI you should be able to execute those commands yourself and get the credentials anyway.\r\n* You open up a possibility to run some dangerous operations - it's enough to set a variable (which user might not see) and get airflow to execute arbitrary command when the command is started. Of course if you can override someone's variables, you can probably do a lot more, but nevertheless it looks dangerous\r\n\r\nI wonder what other committers think about it

IMHO that's not really a debate (or it would imply having it with the Kubernetes project itself). It is a best practice that sensitive data should only be stored in secrets. Secrets and configmaps are managed alongside with the application's deployment: you would provide the same configmaps and secrets to all your Airflow components, the same way you would provide them with the same environment variables or airflow.cfg file. \r\n\r\nWith the current Airflow design the only clean way to convey a configuration that includes sensitive data (user/password for the broker, the database etc.) to Airflow containers in Kubernetes is to provide the whole airflow.cfg file as a secret. That comes with huge drawbacks:\r\n\r\n  * all non-sensitive data cannot be read/analyzed readily anymore\r\n  * you cannot reuse secrets (if the database password is present in two fields, that's two locations where you need to manage it... instead of one secret)\r\n  * you need a tool to generate the airflow.cfg from a template, since you do not want to store the version with sensitive data anywhere in clear-text\r\n\r\nIt is far better to manage your database password in only one secret, and the script that computes the connection string as a configmap that does not contain the secret in clear-text.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/566553394/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
