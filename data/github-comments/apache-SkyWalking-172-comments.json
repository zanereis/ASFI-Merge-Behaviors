It still cost too much. We don't think that is a good idea. Anyway, the better way is provided, let's not stuck in the old design. High level design improvement is always better than purely tech level improvement.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/655203870/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/655236464","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/5051#issuecomment-655236464","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/5051","id":655236464,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1NTIzNjQ2NA==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-08T02:05:25Z","updated_at":"2020-07-08T02:05:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"English only.
