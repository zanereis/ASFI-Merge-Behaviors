These sub-units of the rewrite are referred to as file groups. The largest amount of data that\r\n   * should be compacted in a single group is controlled by {@link #MAX_FILE_GROUP_SIZE_BYTES}. This helps with\r\n   * breaking down the rewriting of very large partitions which may not be rewritable otherwise due to the resource\r\n   * constraints of the cluster. For example a sort based rewrite may not scale to terabyte sized partitions, those\r\n   * partitions need to be worked on in small subsections to avoid exhaustion of resources.\r\n   * <p>\r\n   * When grouping files, the underlying rewrite strategy will use this value as to limit the files which\r\n   * will be included in a single file group.

The `SparkCatalog` will by default wrap itself in a `CachingCatalog` with case sensitivity by default matching that of `spark.sql.caseSensitive` (which defaults to false), and this causes a problem due to Nessie's case sensitivity.\r\nOf course, the problem can be addressed by setting `spark.sql.catalog.nessie.cache.case-sensitive=false`.\r\n\r\nI agree with @szehon-ho that the simplest remedy is to introduce a default of true for `CatalogProperties.CACHE_CASE_SENSITIVE` and use that instead of using the value of `spark.sql.caseSensitive`. This restores the default behavior and allows configurability.\r\nFor non-Nessie users like users of the HiveCatalog, the current behavior is actually very counterintuitive and baffling (see https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/7474) and a default of false would make more sense. However, I'm fine to go with false to avoid breaking existing use cases. At the end of the day, some users are going to have to use a conf to get the non-default behavior, whether Nessie users or others. (Of course, I'd prefer that our users not have to use a conf!)\r\n\r\nIncidentally, `spark.sql.caseSensitive` does not apply only to column names. It applies to database and table names too. E.g., in `org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.catalog.SessionCatalog`, `loadTable` calls `formatDatabaseName` and `formatTableName` (which both depend of the value of `spark.sql.caseSensitive`) before calling the `ExternalCatalog` to load the table.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1535522018/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1535523344","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/6934#issuecomment-1535523344","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/6934","id":1535523344,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85bhjoQ","user":{"login":"stevenzwu","id":1545663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDU2NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1545663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu","html_url":"https://github.com/stevenzwu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-04T23:25:20Z","updated_at":"2023-05-04T23:25:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Spark CI build failed with some seemingly env problem\r\n\r\n```\r\n        Caused by:\r\n        java.lang.RuntimeException: The root scratch dir: /tmp/hive on HDFS should be writable.
