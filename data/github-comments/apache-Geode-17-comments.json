The things to note:\r\n\r\n* The vast majority of these markers are only applied at the TRACE level, and much of the remaining marker usage is at the DEBUG level.  It is unlikely that these usages would be considered common.\r\n* The only marker documented is `GEMFIRE_VERBOSE` (changed in this commit to document `GEODE_VERBOSE`).\r\n* This documentation concludes with \"Typically, it’s more useful to simply enable DEBUG or TRACE on certain classes or packages instead of for the entire Geode product. However, this setting can be used for internal debugging purposes if all other debugging methods fail.\"  Explicitly, the intent is for internal debugging.\r\n* Consequently, the marker definitions are themselves in an `internal` package, even tough they present a public profile.\r\n\r\nI agree that it's a strange grey area.  But I also thing the root cause of this bug -- that non-debug level logs were being improperly suppressed -- was due to poor naming in these markers.\r\n\r\nI suppose there's no inherent need for the marker's field name to match it's string name / the string used in the `log4j2.xml`.  I could try to coerce the old marker strings into the new marker lists.  But since several markers were split to distinguish `*_VERBOSE` debug level logging and `*_MARKER` coarser level logging, it might be awkward to map from the old to the new.  But I could give it a go, if you or anyone else feels strongly about it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/376613381/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/376633480","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/1690#issuecomment-376633480","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/1690","id":376633480,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NjYzMzQ4MA==","user":{"login":"sboorlagadda","id":7171016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNzEwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7171016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sboorlagadda","html_url":"https://github.com/sboorlagadda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sboorlagadda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sboorlagadda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sboorlagadda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sboorlagadda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sboorlagadda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sboorlagadda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sboorlagadda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sboorlagadda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sboorlagadda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-27T18:47:02Z","updated_at":"2018-03-27T18:47:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This is a (kind of) cherry pick version of GEODE-4913 fix onto rel/1.5.0.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/376633480/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/377023719","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/1674#issuecomment-377023719","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/1674","id":377023719,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NzAyMzcxOQ==","user":{"login":"upthewaterspout","id":857521,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1NzUyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/857521?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout","html_url":"https://github.com/upthewaterspout","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-28T20:23:55Z","updated_at":"2018-03-28T20:23:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@PurelyApplied  - I made both of the changes you suggested, along with the rest of the review comments.

That particular method, however, never throws that `Exception` anyway, so I directly removed the `throws` clause from the declaration and modified the `GetClusterConfigurationFunction` as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntry {\r\n  ConfigurationResponse response =\r\n    clusterConfigurationService.createConfigurationResponse(groups);\r\n  context.getResultSender().lastResult(response);\r\n} catch (Exception exception) {\r\n  logger.warn(\"Unable to retrieve the cluster configuration\", exception);\r\n  context.getResultSender().lastResult(exception);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n​\r\nThis means that we are catching and logging (using `log-level=ERROR`) every single exception that might occur while creating the `ConfigurationResponse`. That said, the class `MemberFunctionStreamingMessage` already catches all exceptions thrown by the function execution, but it logs them using `log-level=DEBUG`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\n  try {\r\n...\r\n      this.functionObject.execute(context);\r\n      if (!this.replyLastMsg && this.functionObject.hasResult()) {\r\n        throw new FunctionException(\r\n            LocalizedStrings.ExecuteFunction_THE_FUNCTION_0_DID_NOT_SENT_LAST_RESULT\r\n                .toString(functionObject.getId()));\r\n      }\r\n      stats.endFunctionExecution(start, this.functionObject.hasResult());\r\n...\r\n    } catch (Exception exception) {\r\n      if (logger.isDebugEnabled()) {\r\n        logger.debug(\"Exception occurred on remote member while executing Function: {}\",\r\n            this.functionObject.getId(), exception);\r\n      }\r\n      stats.endFunctionExecutionWithException(this.functionObject.hasResult());\r\n      rex = new ReplyException(exception);\r\n      replyWithException(dm, rex);\r\n      // thr = e.getCause();\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is the reason why the test wasn't failing before: the `LockServiceDestroyedException` was being thrown way before my changes were applied, but it was logged using `log-level=DEBUG` (it seems to be expected at this point of the execution), because of that the `LogConsumer` class wasn't even receiving the event and, thus, no suspicious strings were logged at all so the test didn't fail. Considering that the exception is expected at this point, I've changed `logger.error()` to `logger.warn()` within the function implementation and everything works fine.\r\nThe changes have been rebased and committed already, please let me know if you want me to change something else (didn't squash everything into one single commit to keep the history, but I can do it if you want).\r\nCheers.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/381095435/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/381190963","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/1782#issuecomment-381190963","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/1782","id":381190963,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MTE5MDk2Mw==","user":{"login":"PurelyApplied","id":7175687,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNzU2ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7175687?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PurelyApplied","html_url":"https://github.com/PurelyApplied","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PurelyApplied/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PurelyApplied/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PurelyApplied/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PurelyApplied/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PurelyApplied/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PurelyApplied/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PurelyApplied/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PurelyApplied/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PurelyApplied/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-13T16:32:59Z","updated_at":"2018-04-13T16:32:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Prechecking
