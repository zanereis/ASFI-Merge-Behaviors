So we still need to figure out a short-term solution for the issue #6455.\r\n\r\nI think this Flink usage pattern of `TableLoader` is fine if the `Table` is used as a read-only table.\r\n```\r\n      if (table == null) {\r\n        try (TableLoader loader = tableLoader) {\r\n          loader.open();\r\n          this.table = tableLoader.loadTable();\r\n        } catch (IOException e) {\r\n          throw new UncheckedIOException(e);\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem for `ContinuousSplitPlannerImpl` of FLIP-27 `IcebergSource` is that it uses the `Table` as non read-only, as it needs to refresh the table. With catalog closed, the table is invalid for refresh. One solution is to pass in a cloned `TableLoader` to the `ContinuousSplitPlannerImpl`, which can assumes the ownership of the `TableLoader`. `ContinuousSplitPlannerImpl` also has a `close` method and can call `TableLoader#close` method to release the resources.

I think that closing the JDBC pool before closing the table is the mistake here.\r\n\r\nI think it is not by chance that we do not have a close method on the general Catalog interface. As a general rule we expect the Catalog to be an easy static wrapper around the resources needed  to access the table snapshot pointer.\r\nThis could be strange and I had to push back several times on closing the HMS Connection pool in HiveCatalog when someone wanted to \"fix\" this issue.\r\n\r\nThe JDBC and maybe some other Catalog implementations did not do this pushback, and we are in the situation where the different Catalog implementations behave differently.\r\n\r\nWe should standardize the behavior (who is responsible for closing the connection pools). Hive has its own PoolCache to close unused pools, JDBC doesn't have this (if I understand correctly)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1399896611/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1399900490","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/6629#issuecomment-1399900490","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/6629","id":1399900490,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85TcMlK","user":{"login":"ajantha-bhat","id":5889404,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODk0MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5889404?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat","html_url":"https://github.com/ajantha-bhat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-23T07:12:25Z","updated_at":"2023-01-23T07:12:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> should we raise the severity of the StringSplitter check to ERROR like [here](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/4491e7d6d6911ca0ecf129d7528dda2717f8c938/baseline.gradle#L70) ?\r\nthis prevents similar problems from being introduced again\r\n\r\nWe could add this.

It is a bit challenging. The easier model is share nothing across tasks (e.g. no global static conn pools). Let's say each TM as 8 subtask, each task need to open a client (and connection pool) talking to some external system. Each task is responsible for the ownership and lifecycle of the client. This ties the client/conn pool lifecycle to the Flink subtask lifecycle.\r\n\r\nYeah, if it is a global static, I think your suggestion of loading classes in the Flink parent classloader is probably the way to go. But that would requires some meddling of the image packaging of including the connector jars in the `flink/libs` dir.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1402252806/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1402267342","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/6614#issuecomment-1402267342","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/6614","id":1402267342,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85TlObO","user":{"login":"stevenzwu","id":1545663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDU2NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1545663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu","html_url":"https://github.com/stevenzwu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-24T16:52:42Z","updated_at":"2023-01-24T16:52:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I think that if a catalog is closed, it's reasonable for tables to stop operating as well.

following up to say I got `deleteOrphanFiles` to complete successfully. After bumping the memory, I was confused why I didn't see any output in the logs from an occasional `RetryHttpInitializer: Encountered status code 503 when sending DELETE request to URL` error. I let it run for more than 24 hours; it seemed like the driver was hung rather than deleting any orphan files. \r\n\r\nIn other GitHub issues on deleting orphan files, increasing the number of threads is mentioned. I modified my Spark job to do this with `.executeDeleteWith`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nval executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(30)\r\n\r\nSparkActions\r\n    .get()\r\n    .deleteOrphanFiles(icebergTable)\r\n    .executeDeleteWith(executorService)\r\n    .execute()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe frequency of the 503 retry errors went up. My interpretation is these errors have some small fixed probability of occurring on a Google Storage delete operation. Since there are now 30 concurrent delete operations, the log message is seen more frequently.\r\n\r\nI let this new job run for about 36 hours & it finished deleting orphan files successfully. I wonder if there's some way to emit periodic log messages indicating the number of files that have been deleted, perhaps every 5 minutes. Once my driver had sufficient memory, the deletes were likely happening correctly, but as a user, I was confused when I didn't see any log output. The delete orphan files operation is different from other maintenance operations -- it can't be seen in the Spark UI as a job or stage. \r\n\r\nAny thoughts on adding some periodic log outputs?

the build is already using errorprone i think NullAway would be something to consider:\r\nhttps://github.com/uber/NullAway/\r\nhttps://www.uber.com/en-US/blog/nullaway/\r\n\r\nnewer versions of the gradle-baseline plugins support configuring it more conveniently:\r\nhttps://github.com/palantir/gradle-baseline/tree/develop/baseline-null-away\r\n\r\nthe basic idea is that (below a certain package) all reference types are assumed to be non-null unless they are annotated with `@Nullable`\r\n\r\n(which means that `@NonNull` is not needed, since it is the default)\r\n\r\nso these things become compile time errors:\r\n- returning `null` (or a nullable type) from a method that is not annotated\r\n- passing `null` (or a nullable type) into a method whose parameter is not annotated\r\n- assigning `null` (or a nullable type) to a field that is not annotated\r\n- leaving an unannotated field uninitialized after all constructor/initializer paths\r\n- (... others, you get the idea...)\r\n- most importantly: unconditionally de-referencing a `@Nullable` reference type\r\n\r\ninside an `if (x != null)` block, x of course is no longer considered to have a nullable type\r\n\r\nonce these initial errors are fixed, you will see transitive errors and iterate on fixing them until you reach a stable state, where the use of null is \"consistent\" according to these rules.\r\n\r\none could start with iceberg api, then do it for core and later all other downstream iceberg modules.\r\n\r\nthere is a convenient way of getting started with these \"1st level\" rules by using the following errorprone checks:\r\nhttps://errorprone.info/bugpattern/ReturnMissingNullable\r\nhttps://errorprone.info/bugpattern/FieldMissingNullable\r\nhttps://errorprone.info/bugpattern/ParameterMissingNullable\r\nhttps://errorprone.info/bugpattern/EqualsMissingNullable\r\n\r\nnote: you can run errorprone in a way so all these missing `@Nullable` annotations are added automatically\r\n\r\nso even if NullAway would not be used eventually, applying + enforcing those \"1st level\" errorprone checks, would help documenting (a subset of) the APIs in terms of nullability.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1403346772/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":3,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1403787766","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/6663#issuecomment-1403787766","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/6663","id":1403787766,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85TrBn2","user":{"login":"nastra","id":271029,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MTAyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/271029?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra","html_url":"https://github.com/nastra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-25T15:21:54Z","updated_at":"2023-01-25T15:24:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"do

In the current implementation we're using a FlinkWriteOption so it looks like this right now:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFlinkSink sink = FlinkSink.forRow(dataStream, SimpleDataUtil.FLINK_SCHEMA)\r\n    .table(table)\r\n    .tableLoader(tableLoader)\r\n    .set(\"write-format\", \"avro\")\r\n    .set(FlinkWriteOptions.BRANCH, \"some-branch\")\r\n    .set(FlinkWriteOptions.OVERWRITE_MODE, \"true\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs I implemented this though started to think we may just want to have a direct branch method on the FlinkSink builder itself.

The API below seems better to me\r\n\r\n```\r\nFlinkSink sink = FlinkSink.forRow(dataStream, SimpleDataUtil.FLINK_SCHEMA)\r\n    .table(table)\r\n    .tableLoader(tableLoader)\r\n    .branch(\"some-branch\")\r\n    .set(\"write-format\", \"avro\")\r\n    .set(FlinkWriteOptions.OVERWRITE_MODE, \"true\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n@stevenzwu @yyanyy @rdblue @jackye1995 @namrathamyske  Let me know your thoughts here! \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1403846236/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1403888145","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/6663#issuecomment-1403888145","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/6663","id":1403888145,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85TraIR","user":{"login":"snazy","id":957468,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1NzQ2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/957468?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/snazy","html_url":"https://github.com/snazy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snazy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snazy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snazy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snazy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snazy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snazy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snazy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snazy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snazy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-25T16:29:07Z","updated_at":"2023-01-25T16:29:07Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> do we have the same issue with `UpdateNamespacePropertiesRequest -> updates`?

up.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I did another pass on comparing the REST spec and the request/response classes. `GetNamespaceResponse -> properties` and `CatalogConfig (ConfigResponse) -> overrides/defaults` need to be updated too.\r\n\r\nGiven that you're already handling this here, I think it would be great if you could adjust the mentioned ones as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1403898009/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1403912240","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/6663#issuecomment-1403912240","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/6663","id":1403912240,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85TrgAw","user":{"login":"snazy","id":957468,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1NzQ2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/957468?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/snazy","html_url":"https://github.com/snazy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snazy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snazy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snazy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snazy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snazy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snazy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snazy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snazy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snazy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-25T16:45:45Z","updated_at":"2023-01-25T16:45:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Added

Upstream, each event has some metadata in a dict. Using a column per key in that metadata dict felt like it would compress better than each row having a {\"key1\": 123}, where the key names are relatively static and the values would benefit from columnar compression. The majority of such cols are empty for any particular partition which I assume is near 0 storage/runtime overhead. Like, file 1's rows will have metadata dict {\"abc\": 1234} repeated in virtually the whole GB of data. File 2 may have metadata in most rows of {\"def\": \"foo\"} instead.
