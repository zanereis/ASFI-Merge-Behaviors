It's both confusing and not efficient.

I did not know that, giving your explanation I rest my arguments ;)\n\n@nvazquez, you changed the method “getMountPoint” to receive a NFS protocol version, that method uses the version in another method that is called “mount”, in which you added a conditional to check if the version != null, then you add it to the mount command. I am ok with that code.\n\nI only have a doubt, if the version may be required why aren’t you using it in most of the code? It seems that you mostly call the “getMountPoint” method as “mountService.getMountPoint(secondaryStorageUrl, null)”.\n\nActually, the only time I see you using the NFS protocol version is when you use the “prepareSecondaryStorageStore” method. As @serg38 nicely explained that there are vendors that do not support version negotiation, wouldn’t that be the case to always use the version that you already have in hand?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/174734613/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/174746870","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1361#issuecomment-174746870","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1361","id":174746870,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3NDc0Njg3MA==","user":{"login":"serg38","id":16176702,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTc2NzAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16176702?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38","html_url":"https://github.com/serg38","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-26T00:30:34Z","updated_at":"2016-01-26T00:30:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I believe the main reason is to provide the most of backward compatibility. image_store_details doesn't have NFS version in existing installations so after the upgrade to this code it will continue working without any additional changes.

Most of the times you just send a null, only at the SSVM code you are using the version; wouldn’t this cause problems in some other piece of the code base such as the one you found out?\nYou already have the method “getNfsVersion” that will return a null if the version is not configured; I do not see a good reason not to use it; this way we would have a more concise code.\n\nAdditionally, you have duplicated the code of “getNfsVersion” in two or three places, I believe we should avoid those duplicated code.\n\nI would also add a Java doc to the “getNfsVersion”, stating what it does, what parameters it looks for, what happens if it does not find the parameter and where (in the DB) those parameters are stored.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/175093081/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/175103859","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1361#issuecomment-175103859","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1361","id":175103859,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3NTEwMzg1OQ==","user":{"login":"nvazquez","id":5295080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyOTUwODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5295080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez","html_url":"https://github.com/nvazquez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-26T16:32:52Z","updated_at":"2016-01-26T16:32:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ok,
