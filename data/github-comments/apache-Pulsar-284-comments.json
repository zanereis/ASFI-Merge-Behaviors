And even then, here is the generated `updateFunction` route:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n      \"put\": {\r\n        \"tags\": [\r\n          \"functions\"\r\n        ],\r\n        \"summary\": \"Updates a Pulsar Function currently running in cluster mode\",\r\n        \"operationId\": \"updateFunction\",\r\n        \"consumes\": [\r\n          \"multipart/form-data\"\r\n        ],\r\n        \"produces\": [\r\n          \"application/json\"\r\n        ],\r\n        \"parameters\": [\r\n          {\r\n            \"name\": \"tenant\",\r\n            \"in\": \"path\",\r\n            \"description\": \"The tenant of a Pulsar Function\",\r\n            \"required\": true,\r\n            \"type\": \"string\"\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            \"name\": \"namespace\",\r\n            \"in\": \"path\",\r\n            \"description\": \"The namespace of a Pulsar Function\",\r\n            \"required\": true,\r\n            \"type\": \"string\"\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            \"name\": \"functionName\",\r\n            \"in\": \"path\",\r\n            \"description\": \"The name of a Pulsar Function\",\r\n            \"required\": true,\r\n            \"type\": \"string\"\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            \"in\": \"body\",\r\n            \"name\": \"body\",\r\n            \"required\": false,\r\n            \"schema\": {\r\n              \"originalRef\": \"InputStream\",\r\n              \"$ref\": \"#/definitions/InputStream\"\r\n            }\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            \"in\": \"body\",\r\n            \"name\": \"body\",\r\n            \"required\": false,\r\n            \"schema\": {\r\n              \"originalRef\": \"FormDataContentDisposition\",\r\n              \"$ref\": \"#/definitions/FormDataContentDisposition\"\r\n            }\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            \"in\": \"body\",\r\n            \"name\": \"body\",\r\n            \"required\": false,\r\n            \"schema\": {\r\n              \"type\": \"string\"\r\n            }\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            \"in\": \"body\",\r\n            \"name\": \"body\",\r\n            \"description\": \"<description snipped>\",\r\n            \"required\": false,\r\n            \"schema\": {\r\n              \"originalRef\": \"FunctionConfig\",\r\n              \"$ref\": \"#/definitions/FunctionConfig\"\r\n            },\r\n            \"x-examples\": {\r\n              \"application/json\": \"{\\n  \\\"inputs\\\": persistent://public/default/input-topic,\\n  \\\"parallelism\\\": 4\\n  \\\"output\\\": persistent://public/default/output-topic\\n  \\\"log-topic\\\": persistent://public/default/log-topic\\n  \\\"classname\\\": org.example.test.ExclamationFunction\\n  \\\"jar\\\": java-function-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar\\n}\"\r\n            }\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            \"in\": \"body\",\r\n            \"name\": \"body\",\r\n            \"description\": \"The update options is for the Pulsar Function that needs to be updated.\",\r\n            \"required\": false,\r\n            \"schema\": {\r\n              \"originalRef\": \"UpdateOptions\",\r\n              \"$ref\": \"#/definitions/UpdateOptions\"\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        ],\r\n        \"responses\": {\r\n          \"403\": {\r\n            \"description\": \"The requester doesn't have admin permissions\"\r\n          },\r\n          \"400\": {\r\n            \"description\": \"Invalid request (The Pulsar Function doesn't exist, etc.)\"\r\n          },\r\n          \"200\": {\r\n            \"description\": \"Pulsar Function successfully updated\"\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      },\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nMore of the same. Form params getting incorrectly generated as `body`.\r\n\r\nWe've about reached the end of things I can think to try. Will probably open a new issue to track a (much larger) effort to migrate annotations to OpenAPI3/swagger 2/`io.openapitools.swagger` v2.x.x, since that branch of the plugin seems quite a bit more mature.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/759945918/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/759975921","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/9192#issuecomment-759975921","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/9192","id":759975921,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1OTk3NTkyMQ==","user":{"login":"Jennifer88huang-zz","id":47805623,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODA1NjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47805623?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz","html_url":"https://github.com/Jennifer88huang-zz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-14T07:13:40Z","updated_at":"2021-01-14T07:13:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"/pulsarbot run-failure-checks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/759975921/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/759976954","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/9192#issuecomment-759976954","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/9192","id":759976954,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1OTk3Njk1NA==","user":{"login":"Jennifer88huang-zz","id":47805623,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODA1NjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47805623?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz","html_url":"https://github.com/Jennifer88huang-zz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-14T07:16:10Z","updated_at":"2021-01-14T07:16:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> > Thank you @freeznet\r\n> > I was wondering if we cite a long example from a yaml file, would it better if we use a reference link in the doc in the future.\r\n> \r\n> @Jennifer88huang thats great idea, such as a link to github file content with correct version tag.\r\n\r\n@freeznet I couldn't agree more.

Because we get the authentication data when a new connection opened and it will not change until it reconnected.\r\nWe handle the refresh command to let the client can replace the token but doesn't need to disconnect from the broker. The client-side still get a token from the method `getAuthData` which is abstracted in the `AuthenticationDataProvider`, user can handle the token generates logic at the method `getAuthData`. \r\n/cc @jiazhai Correct me if I missed something.\r\n\r\nI improve the expiration token test to include my case.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/762237821/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
