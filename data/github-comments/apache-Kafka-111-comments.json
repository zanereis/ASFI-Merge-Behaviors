Thinking about it a bit more, I now understand your arguments before: tags were not used to distinguish sensors in the sensor registry (i.e. `ConcurrentMap<String, Sensor> sensors`), so without the processor-node as part of the sensor name they will collapse into the same sensor, that can be potentially accessed by multiple threads.\r\n\r\nIn that case, you are right that we do need to have both the processor node name as well as the task id string as part of the `NodeMetrics` sensors, and have the task id string as the `TaskMetrics` sensors. \r\n\r\nYour current naming as the format of\r\n\r\n```\r\nthread.streams-thread-XXX.task.1-1PROCESSOR-XXX-processor-throughput\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere `thread.THREAD-ID` comes from the prefix in `StreamsMetricsImpl`. And there is no separators between `taskId` and `processor name`, and we use the `-` separator between `processor name` and the actually sensor name. I am wondering if we could remove this prefix and refactor the rest prefixes as\r\n\r\n```\r\ntask.1-1.PROCESSOR-XXX.processor-throughput\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason is that tasks can migrated between threads from time to time, and when that happens some of the existing sensor will not have any data any more while some more sensors need to be created if we keep the thread id as the prefix, and for using the `.` separator it is mainly for consistency with other sensors. \r\n\r\nDitto for task metrics as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/266758773/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/266803034","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2247#issuecomment-266803034","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2247","id":266803034,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NjgwMzAzNA==","user":{"login":"mjsax","id":8959638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NTk2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8959638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax","html_url":"https://github.com/mjsax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-13T17:24:07Z","updated_at":"2016-12-13T17:24:07Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@guozhangwang Call for review.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/266803034/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/266806594","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2215#issuecomment-266806594","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2215","id":266806594,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NjgwNjU5NA==","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-13T17:36:57Z","updated_at":"2016-12-13T17:36:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@dguy I was not reading the diff file carefully, and my intention was from the original description in the JIRA ticket itself:\r\n\r\n```\r\nIf there were a \"metrics()\" method of StreamMetrics to give me the underlying Metrics object, I could register my own sensors/metrics as needed.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think this PR's proposed APIs for exposing the read-only metrics map for users to lookup does makes sense and it is consistent with other clients.

as this was supposed to be a step before client compatibility, in current PR API version checks are based on if there is any version overlap between client and broker for an API. However, as the client always sends the latest API version, to be able to catch that I will have to set expected minimum API version to latest version of the API. With that the version mismatch will be caught. However, soon client compatibility work will have to revert it back to what it is right now. I am changing the min expected version to be the latest API version and adding a comment indicating that it needs to be changed to min version when backwards client compatibility is added.
