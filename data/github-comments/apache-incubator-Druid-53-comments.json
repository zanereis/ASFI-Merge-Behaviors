from some minor comments, this PR looks good to me. However, I would agree with @gianm about not completely replacing IndexMerger with this but release them together and give user ability to choose. After a while, when it has been used in production in multiple clusters, we can remove IndexMerger.\nOne quick way of doing that would be to make IndexMergerV9 extend IndexMerger with all the relevant methods overridden, then based on a runtime.properties configuration bind either IndexMerger or IndexMergerV9 instance in guice.\n\nSide-note: I hadn't really looked at IndexMaker code much and curious to know at high level what high level improvements make this better than IndexMaker? can anyone with relevant knowledge pls answer.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/169902650/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/169902986","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/2224#issuecomment-169902986","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2224","id":169902986,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2OTkwMjk4Ng==","user":{"login":"hamlet-lee","id":12079531,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDc5NTMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12079531?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamlet-lee","html_url":"https://github.com/hamlet-lee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamlet-lee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamlet-lee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamlet-lee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamlet-lee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamlet-lee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamlet-lee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamlet-lee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamlet-lee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamlet-lee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-08T05:48:53Z","updated_at":"2016-01-08T05:48:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"ingest\n\n```\n{\n

hear you, you're correct. I've made a simple experiment to confirm that.\nConsider a DB with such three values (config_id and stream_name are irrelevant, I just used our internal tool for filling this). Segment granularity is 1 DAY.\n\n```\n{\"data_num\":490865.0,\"timestamp\":\"2015-09-24T10:00:00.000Z\",\"config_id\":\"2222222222222222222222222222222222222222\",\"stream_name\":\"test\"}\n{\"data_num\":136179.0,\"timestamp\":\"2015-09-24T20:00:00.000Z\",\"config_id\":\"2222222222222222222222222222222222222222\",\"stream_name\":\"test\"}\n{\"data_num\":236171.0,\"timestamp\":\"2015-09-25T12:00:00.000Z\",\"config_id\":\"2222222222222222222222222222222222222222\",\"stream_name\":\"test\"}\n```\n\nThen issue a query:\n\n``` bash\n2016-01-08 07:14:44\nmonitowl-dev:root:/vagrant> cat query2.json\n{\n    \"filter\": {\n        \"fields\": [\n            {\n                \"type\": \"selector\",\n                \"dimension\": \"config_id\",\n                \"value\": \"2222222222222222222222222222222222222222\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"type\": \"selector\",\n                \"dimension\": \"stream_name\",\n                \"value\": \"test\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"type\": \"and\"\n    },\n    \"intervals\": \"2015-09-24T10:00:00.000000/2015-09-25T13:00:00.000000\",\n    \"dataSource\": \"logdb_data\",\n    \"context\": {\n        \"skipEmptyBuckets\": \"false\"\n    },\n    \"granularity\": {\n        \"origin\": \"1970-01-01T00:00:00\",\n        \"type\": \"period\",\n        \"period\": \"PT3600S\"\n    },\n    \"queryType\": \"timeseries\",\n    \"aggregations\": [\n        {\n            \"fieldName\": \"data_num\",\n            \"type\": \"doubleSum\",\n            \"name\": \"sum\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n2016-01-08 07:14:47 cat query2.json\n2016-01-08 07:14:47\nmonitowl-dev:root:/vagrant> curl -X POST 'http://localhost:10000/druid/v2/?pretty' -H 'content-type: application/json' -d@query2.json\n[ {\n  \"timestamp\" : \"2015-09-24T10:00:00.000Z\",\n  \"result\" : {\n    \"sum\" : 490865.0\n  }\n}, {\n  \"timestamp\" : \"2015-09-24T11:00:00.000Z\",\n  \"result\" : {\n    \"sum\" : 0.0\n  }\n}, {\n  \"timestamp\" : \"2015-09-24T12:00:00.000Z\",\n  \"result\" : {\n    \"sum\" : 0.0\n  }\n}, {\n  \"timestamp\" : \"2015-09-24T13:00:00.000Z\",\n  \"result\" : {\n    \"sum\" : 0.0\n  }\n}, {\n  \"timestamp\" : \"2015-09-24T14:00:00.000Z\",\n  \"result\" : {\n    \"sum\" : 0.0\n  }\n}, {\n  \"timestamp\" : \"2015-09-24T15:00:00.000Z\",\n  \"result\" : {\n    \"sum\" : 0.0\n  }\n}, {\n  \"timestamp\" : \"2015-09-24T16:00:00.000Z\",\n  \"result\" : {\n    \"sum\" : 0.0\n  }\n}, {\n  \"timestamp\" : \"2015-09-24T17:00:00.000Z\",\n  \"result\" : {\n    \"sum\" : 0.0\n  }\n}, {\n  \"timestamp\" : \"2015-09-24T18:00:00.000Z\",\n  \"result\" : {\n    \"sum\" : 0.0\n  }\n}, {\n  \"timestamp\" : \"2015-09-24T19:00:00.000Z\",\n  \"result\" : {\n    \"sum\" : 0.0\n  }\n}, {\n  \"timestamp\" : \"2015-09-24T20:00:00.000Z\",\n  \"result\" : {\n    \"sum\" : 136179.0\n  }\n}, {\n  \"timestamp\" : \"2015-09-25T12:00:00.000Z\",\n  \"result\" : {\n    \"sum\" : 236171.0\n  }\n} ]\n2016-01-08 07:14:51 curl -X POST 'http://localhost:10000/druid/v2/?pretty' -H 'content-type: application/json' -d@query2.json\n```\n\nSee that intervals within 2015-09-24 (that's single segment) are filled properly, but subsequent intervals in between two segments are not.\nI'd say that this _is_ indeed confusing. Well, I got confused, too.\n\nWith this working as is, we'd have to do the filling client side, as our processing expects that result of a single query will be continuous. I'd rather have that done Druid side.\n\nAnyway, thanks @CHOIJAEHONG1 for clarifying what's going on here.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/169916753/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/169954160","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/2061#issuecomment-169954160","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2061","id":169954160,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2OTk1NDE2MA==","user":{"login":"se7entyse7en","id":5599208,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1OTkyMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5599208?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/se7entyse7en","html_url":"https://github.com/se7entyse7en","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/se7entyse7en/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/se7entyse7en/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/se7entyse7en/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/se7entyse7en/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/se7entyse7en/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/se7entyse7en/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/se7entyse7en/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/se7entyse7en/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/se7entyse7en/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-08T10:15:19Z","updated_at":"2016-01-08T10:15:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I was trying to add a filtered aggregator at ingestion time too and then I bumped into this issue.

This is a non-trivial thing because there isn't really a solid concept or delineation between \"service\" and \"capacities\". \n\nTo me it would make more sense to have a host:port combination announce itself, maybe with some predefined set of capacities, but then have any state information be accessible through endpoints exposed at the host:port, with API guaranteed by what type of
