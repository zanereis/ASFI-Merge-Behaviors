can I ask why?\r\n\r\nBecause that is 9x `9`s in epoch (`999999999`, assuming seconds).\r\n\r\n> for < 10, we don't know if it is millis or timestamps, at least that is my thinking. adding a 0 up to 13 for those numbers is equally as bad as just leaving them no?\r\n\r\nWell, that's partially true.  We know that for 1-3 digits it must be seconds, and for 11-13 digits it must be millis.  Perhaps we provide an optional field that specifies millis vs seconds with a default to whatever is more common (seconds) and be done with it?  Do we have any core assumptions of using milli elsewhere?  Of course this will need an update to a lot of tests to either change to seconds or specify milli.\r\n\r\nAs far as attempting to appropriately zero-pad it (which I think is what you mentioned but I could be wrong), I'm probably against that because a small mistake could drastically affect the timestamp.  To be explicit - `1234567890` (2009) could become `00001234567890` (1970) or `123456789` (1973) could become `0000123456789` (1970).  More realistically, this probably isn't a horrible approach either.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/322242021/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/322249821","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/692#issuecomment-322249821","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/692","id":322249821,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMjI0OTgyMQ==","user":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-14T17:11:17Z","updated_at":"2017-08-14T17:11:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm going to close this.

I haven't noticed any obvious bugs and it was fairly easy to install and start.  I would suggest we add a note in the \"Development Setup\" section of the metron-alerts README that tells users how to access the UI.  I know it's \"localhost:4200\" and to login as \"user/password\" because I'm familiar with the management UI but others probably won't know that.\r\n\r\nI do not think the DataSource/ElasticSearchLocalstorageImpl/RestApiImpl abstraction is correct.  We only have a single Metron REST implementation so I don't see why we would need to abstract this.  I know things are in a weird state switching from directly calling ES to going through the REST layer, but I don't think this moves us in the right direction.  I would rather see a standalone SearchService class that matches the SearchController in the REST layer.  As we create more REST controllers and endpoints, the services on the client-side would also be created/updated to match.  Eventually the DataSource/ElasticSearchLocalstorageImpl classes would be empty and at that point we would know we're done moving the calls to REST.  With this approach, all the functions will end up in RestApiImpl and that's not the end state we want.  Sure we could reorganize them after all the DataSource methods are implemented in RestApiImpl but why not do it incrementally?\r\n\r\n@nickwallen has already put in time testing and this is more of a style/organization issue so I would be ok with deferring this to a future PR.  However any +1 from me in the future would require we work this out.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/324384473/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/324423602","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/713#issuecomment-324423602","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/713","id":324423602,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNDQyMzYwMg==","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-23T18:33:41Z","updated_at":"2017-08-23T18:33:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @as22323  - Thanks for submitting a PR.

Perhaps an example would help here.  For the message\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"title\" : \"otto is great\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIf I wanted to rename title to `better_title`, I'd expect the following to work:\r\n```\r\n{ \r\n  \"transformation\" : \"STELLAR\"\r\n ,\"output\" : [ \"better_title\", \"title\"]\r\n ,\"config\" : {\r\n          \"better_title\" : \"title\"\r\n         ,\"title\" : \"null\"\r\n                    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAt the end of this, I'd expect either `title` to be gone *or* at the very least, for it to be set to `null` as that is what I directed it to do, but in actuality, it'll still be `otto is great`.  In fact, the output would be:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"title\" : \"otto is great\",\r\n  \"better_title\" : \"otto is great\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis becomes even MORE insidious if we start doing things like returning null from Stellar functions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/325023583/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/325025010","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/718#issuecomment-325025010","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/718","id":325025010,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNTAyNTAxMA==","user":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-25T20:18:47Z","updated_at":"2017-08-25T20:21:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":" \r\n            if(outputs.contains(oField)) {\r\n              ret.put(oField, o);\r\n            }\r\n            if( o != null ) {\r\n              intermediateVariables.put(oField, o);\r\n            } else {\r\n              // remove here, in case there are other statements\r\n              intermediateVariables.remove(oField);\r\n            }","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/325025010/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
