The code looks mostly good, but here are some thoughts:\r\n\r\n  - The head task supports only one concurrent checkpoint. In general, the tasks need to support multiple checkpoints being in progress at the same time. It frequently happens when people trigger savepoints concurrent to a running checkpoint. I think that is important to support.\r\n\r\n  - There tail task offers the elements to the blocking queue. That means records are simply dropped if the capacity bound queue (one element) is not polled by the head task in time.\r\n\r\n  - With the capacity bound in the feedback queue, it is pretty easy to build a full deadlock. Just use a loop function that explodes data into the feedback channel.\r\n\r\n  - Recent code also introduced the ability to change parallelism. What are the semantics here when the parallelism of the loop is changed?\r\n\r\nSince loops did not support any fault tolerance guarantees, I guess this does improve recovery behavior. But as long as the loops can either deadlock or drop data, the hard guarantees are in the end still a bit weak. So that leaves me a bit ambivalent what to do with this pull request.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/266572177/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/266572235","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1668#issuecomment-266572235","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1668","id":266572235,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NjU3MjIzNQ==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-12T22:23:32Z","updated_at":"2016-12-12T22:23:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"To suggest some way to fix the guarantees: To my mind, the crux lies in the way that the feedback channel is implemented - a simple blocking queue just does not cut it for that case. To make this proper, I think we need to do the following:\r\n  - Have an elastic feedback channel (unbounded) with a certain memory budget, that can spill if needed. I think it would be best implemented holding data serialized.\r\n  - On checkpoint, one simply adds the feedback channel data (already bytes) to the checkpoint\r\n  - The source task should probably prioritize reading from the feedback channel, to keep it always as small as possible.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/266572235/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/266666615","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2986#issuecomment-266666615","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2986","id":266666615,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NjY2NjYxNQ==","user":{"login":"mushketyk","id":592286,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MjI4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/592286?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk","html_url":"https://github.com/mushketyk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-13T07:29:42Z","updated_at":"2016-12-13T07:29:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @greghogan ,\r\nThank you for your review.

are some good points @StephanEwen, thanks for checking it. \r\nHow about the following, regarding each issue:\r\n\r\n- `Concurrent Checkpoints`: Looks like an improvement but I can sure do it in this PR if  it is a crucial one. Can you elaborate a bit more or point me out to other concurrent checkpointing operator state examples to get an idea of how you want to do it?\r\n- `Reconfiguration` : Sounds interesting...but I am not really aware of it from the devlist. If it is simple enough I could add support for it here. Otherwise I would suggest we address this in a seperate JIRA and PR as an improvement. Is there a design document on how we plan to achieve reconfiguration and repartitioning for operator state specifically somewhere?\r\n- `At-most-once blocking queue` : It is obvious from my previous comments that I do not approve this part, but that is something we already got rid of in [FLIP-15](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/FLIP-15+Scoped+Loops+and+Job+Termination) already ([this](https://github.com/FouadMA/flink/commit/9adaac435bcaf3552afe564c739d4e8fd79c433b) commit). How about we address this together with the deadlocks in FLIP-15?\r\n- `Deadlocks`: I like the elastic spilling channel idea to resolve deadlocks. I need time to dig a bit more into this and make sure we solve deadlocks and not just improve. Is it ok with you if we address that in [FLIP-15](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/FLIP-15+Scoped+Loops+and+Job+Termination)? I need more time for this part, plus, we need to combine the absense of expiring queues with a proper termination algorithm (otherwise we just solve the deadlocks and the jobs never terminate).\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/266686098/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/266689168","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2994#issuecomment-266689168","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2994","id":266689168,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NjY4OTE2OA==","user":{"login":"hzyuemeng1","id":20553274,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTUzMjc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20553274?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzyuemeng1","html_url":"https://github.com/hzyuemeng1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzyuemeng1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzyuemeng1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzyuemeng1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzyuemeng1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzyuemeng1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzyuemeng1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzyuemeng1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzyuemeng1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzyuemeng1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-13T09:29:27Z","updated_at":"2016-12-13T09:29:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ChengXiangLi

hold multiple snapshots, which are saved by multiple background threads\r\n  - none of the operators deal with in-flight data, which makes their job easy\r\n\r\nDealing with in-flight data probably

I had a quick look at the implementation and it looks quite good. 👍 I'll look at it in more detail once the 1.2 release is out and then I'll also have more thorough comments.\r\n\r\nThese are some quick comments off the top of my head:\r\n - I think we can extend `Collector` with a `collect(OutputTag, T)` method. Then we wouldn't need the extra `RichCollector` and `CollectorWrapper` to work around that.\r\n - For `WindowedStream` I would like to have something like this:\r\n```\r\nOutputTag<T> lateElementsOutput = ...;\r\nDataStream<T> input = ...\r\nSingleOutputStreamOperator<O> windowed = input\r\n  .keyBy(...)\r\n  .window(...)\r\n  .apply(Function, lateElementsOutput);\r\n\r\nDataStream<T> lateElements = windowed.getSideOutput(lateElementsOutput);\r\n```\r\nor maube something else if we find a better Idea. With the `WindowedStream.tooLateElements()` this would instantiate an extra `WindowOperator` just for getting late elements while another window operator would be responsible for processing the actual elements. That seems wasteful.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/266753146/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/266756797","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2810#issuecomment-266756797","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2810","id":266756797,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2Njc1Njc5Nw==","user":{"login":"tonycox","id":15128562,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTI4NTYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15128562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonycox","html_url":"https://github.com/tonycox","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonycox/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonycox/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonycox/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonycox/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonycox/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonycox/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonycox/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonycox/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonycox/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-13T14:46:22Z","updated_at":"2016-12-13T14:52:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @fhueske , what should I finish first, this PR or FLINK-5188?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/266756797/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/266758772","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2664#issuecomment-266758772","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2664","id":266758772,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2Njc1ODc3Mg==","user":{"login":"greghogan","id":569655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2OTY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/569655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan","html_url":"https://github.com/greghogan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-13T14:53:47Z","updated_at":"2016-12-13T14:53:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@StephanEwen @rmetzger, as I revisit this, I'm still questioning the viability of shading an uber jar.

In detached mode we ensure cluster shutdown through a message sent by the client during job submission to tell the JobManager that this is going to be the last job it has to execute. In interactive execution mode, the user jar can contain multiple jobs; this is mostly useful for interactive batch jobs. Since we just execute the main method of the user jar, we don't know how many jobs are submitted and when to shutdown the cluster. That's why we chose to delegate the shutdown to the client for interactive jobs. Thus, I'm hesitant to remove the shutdown hook because it ensures that the cluster shuts down during interactive job executions. It prevents clusters from lingering around when the client shuts down.\r\n\r\nA couple of solution for this problem:\r\n\r\n1. The JobManager watches the client and shuts down a) if it looses connection to the client and the job it executes has completed or b) the client tells the JobManager to shut down.\r\n\r\n2. The JobManager drives the execution which is now part of the client\r\n\r\n3. We don't allow multiple jobs to execute. Then we always have a clear shutdown point. This is perhaps the easiest and most elegant solution. Most users only execute a single job at a time anyways. We can still allow interactive job executions if the user chooses to. Perhaps we can make this more explicit in the API to give a hint to the client. \r\n\r\nI'm afraid we will have to close this PR until we realize one of the above solutions (or another one).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/266821189/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/266844479","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2969#issuecomment-266844479","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2969","id":266844479,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2Njg0NDQ3OQ==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-13T19:57:50Z","updated_at":"2016-12-13T19:57:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 looks good.

Yes plugin cannot detect out of box cross-module coverage, but there are some tricks how it could be done.\r\n\r\nI've implemented and tested one of them.\r\nI squash older commits and split my works to two commits.\r\nThe first one adds coverage plugin and change surefire configuration.\r\nThe second one adds:\r\n\r\n- new maven submodule for coverage report aggregation.\r\n- change shade maven plugin configuration. When tests run with coverage profile shaded jar doesn't replace original jar(shadedArtifactAttached=true). It needs because maven-shade-plugin changes class files and it makes impossible coverage reports aggregations, because jacoco requires the same classes on data collecting and report phases.\r\n\r\nChanges in shade configuration made some test broken:\r\n- `ClassLoaderITCase`\r\n- `ZooKeeperLeaderElectionITCase`\r\n- `JobManagerHACheckpointRecoveryITCase`\r\n\r\nI investigate that they cannot run correctly without shading and there is no way to fix it.\r\nI think it is not a big problem.\r\n\r\nSo you can get full coverage report by running command `mvn clean install -Pcoverage -Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=true` and open `flink/flink-test-utils-parent/flink-test-utils-coverage/target/site/jacoco-aggregate/index.html`\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about these changes?\r\nI glad to
