However your design so far looks reasonably good though.\n\nHere are my few comments/suggestions -\n1. I do agree with you that Interpreter Authorization is complex. But the examples you have provided, if I'm not missing anything, those are related to Authentication of executing the target technology not related to the interpreter itself. The authorization considerations for Interpreters should be who can change an interpreter setting, who can execute an interpreter, who can create a new interpreter from the existing interpreter set. So essentially you need to plugin here the Role of a user which you'll get from enterprise authentication/authorization system like LDAP. So as an example at the enterprise level someone will typically setup say 2 types roles for users using Zeppelin. Role type 1, say Zeppelin Administrator. Administrator will have access to the setting of access control for all interpreters, can control the users who can schedule running of his/her notebook (though I may be a notebook author I need not have the ability to schedule it to run it any time as I may be hogging enterprise cluster resource and impact some other higher priority job), who can import/export, etc. Then Role type 2, say Regular User. This Regular User will create the notebook, change the permission settings to his/her notebook. Based on this Role the user will even have access to access control setup for interpreters, notebook, scheduler.\n2. Coming to Moon's point where you are storing the access control information for every notebook  and interpreters is very important. In my opinion it should not be in the Notebook itself as it is a plain text information and can be seen/exported by anyone whoever has access to the Notebook folder (or can export the same). There are typically three ways one can handle this. Firstly, you can store it as a separate encrypted file in a secured folder in the file system. Only the Zeppelin process ( essentially the super user who started the Zeppelin server) has access to that folder and can do any change. Secondly to a target database. Or Thirdly even in LDAP . The configurations for option 2 and 3 can come from a configuration again stored in an encrypted file in a folder which only the super user (who typically starts the zeppelin process) can access. You may start with any one implementation but having a generic interface/abstraction (so that later on other implementations can be plugged in) is recommended.\n3. I see you have assumed that there would be a separate authentication component. To model the same with something which will typically be used I may suggest you to refer to design/interfaces of Apache Knox. People would be using Zeppelin a lot in their Hadoop Cluster and there would be good chance that they will use Knox (Knox comes in most of the hadoop distribution) as a gateway (which will in turn authenticate the users with enterprise level LDAP) to authenticate users accessing Zeppelin. Basically Knox will do the authentication and will pass the necessary roles to your module and then your model can use them to differentiate between who is Zeppelin Administrator and who is Regular User.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nRegards,\nSourav\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/180820970/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/180837044","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/695#issuecomment-180837044","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/695","id":180837044,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MDgzNzA0NA==","user":{"login":"felixcheung","id":8969467,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5Njk0Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8969467?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung","html_url":"https://github.com/felixcheung","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-06T18:46:10Z","updated_at":"2016-02-06T18:46:10Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"looks good\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/180837044/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/180837301","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/699#issuecomment-180837301","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/699","id":180837301,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MDgzNzMwMQ==","user":{"login":"felixcheung","id":8969467,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5Njk0Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8969467?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung","html_url":"https://github.com/felixcheung","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-06T18:51:07Z","updated_at":"2016-02-06T18:51:07Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"looks good -

It _will_ be downloaded whenever the user updates their R package library.  R data scientists users do quite regularly because the functionality is built into R.  There is no way to prevent an updated rscala from being used in place of the rscala included with this code.  (The issue is the R-side of the rscala library more than the java side, but that's beside the point.)\n\nThis has already created breakages:  The author of rscala recently fixed a bug that affected Windows users.  The new version broke Eric's implementation, which had to be refactored.  \n\n**Licenses** Regarding licenses --you are correct that rscala is available under BSD. I convinced the author to switch from GPL to BSD so it could be used in PR 208. \n\n**Tests** You are astute to require unit tests.  The reason this code is passing CI is that it isn't being tested _at all._  Neither R, nor the classes here, are ever executed. \n\nRelated to that:  There's no code here to handle changes in the SparkInterpreter class, which has caused severe breakages in the spark-interpreter/R integration in the past.  There's also no code in here to handle the common Zeppelin/Spark misconfigurations that are 99% of the user issues that arise when you add R to zeppelin; or to handle spark-related issues at all. \n\nOne reason for this is, surely, because Eric only added the integration a few weeks ago, after I pointed-out on the mailing list that the functionality was absent.  Since Eric based his code on mine (which he is absolutely entitled to do), I'm pretty sure it will start to have the same issues if it ever develops a user base.  \n\n**Other** There are a slew of other issues here related to integration with the rest of Zeppelin, presentation of R in a manner that R-using data scientists will be familiar with, and allowing the full R functionality.  \n\nAs just one example:   it doesn't support R base-plotting, and I'm pretty sure it won't support interactive visualizations either. \n\nI am not going to list all of those issues here now, when we're trying to resolve the issue of PR 208 -- which _does_ handle all of them, and quite a few more.  This is because I worked through them over the last six months in responding to requests and issues from users.\n\n(Just to be clear, this is @elbamos  -- I've been switching from OS X to Ubuntu, and it looks like I logged in with the wrong e-mail address and a git account I made an eternity ago and never
