Pre-Upgrade Checks:\r\n\r\n    * **Review the release notes:** Carefully review the release notes for Spark 3.4 and 3.5.x, paying particular attention to breaking changes, deprecations, and new features.\r\n      * https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/migration-guide.html\r\n    \r\n\r\n   * **Review previous upgrade commits:** We have a rich history of previous upgrades to help with the extent of changeset.\r\n   \r\n       * https://github.com/apache/systemds/commit/bb7fd141746d955159b249a4c2b8893bf2ddb0c2\r\n   \r\n    * **Compatibility checks:** Ensure the application's dependencies (libraries, frameworks) are compatible with Spark 3.5. Some libraries may require upgrades or adjustments to work with the newer version.\r\n      ```java\r\n      java/org/apache/sysds/runtime/compress/colgroup/APreAgg.java:[22,31] package org.apache.commons.lang does not exist\r\n      ```\r\n      \r\n   * **Build and test application locally:** Rebuild and test your application locally with Spark 3.5 to identify any compilation errors or functionality regressions. Try with components you are familiar with as a starting point.\r\n   * **Review logging and monitoring:** Update logging and monitoring configurations to work with Spark 3.5. I believe the log4j template needs update.\r\n\r\n- [x] 2.  Specific Considerations:\r\n\r\n    * **SQL, Datasets, and DataFrames:** potential breaking changes in SQL syntax, DataFrame behavior, and schema inference.\r\n    * **Spark API usage:** Review your internal Spark API usage for any deprecations or new features available in 3.5.x. \r\n        * https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/java/index.html\r\n\r\n- [x] 3. Design Steps for Upgrade: (optional)\r\n    In case, we want to support upgrade in the hot running system.\r\n\r\n    * **Gradual rollout:** Consider a phased rollout of the upgrade to minimize risk. We could start by deploying to a staging environment for testing, then gradually roll out to production in batches. (if there is production instance of systemds)\r\n    * **Monitor closely:** monitor application after the upgrade for any performance regressions, errors, or unexpected behavior.\r\n    * **Rollback plan:** Have a rollback plan in place in case you encounter unexpected issues after the upgrade. This might involve reverting to Spark 3.3 or rolling back specific changes you made.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/1859180903/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":1,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/1859185861","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/1961#issuecomment-1859185861","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1961","id":1859185861,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArxUbc5u0OzF","user":{"login":"j143","id":53068787,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMDY4Nzg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53068787?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143","html_url":"https://github.com/j143","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-17T14:18:43Z","updated_at":"2023-12-17T14:18:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"For Hadoop upgrade, we simply change the pom version.\r\nBut, we can have a look at whether any specific internal updates are required.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/1859185861/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/1859186991","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/1957#issuecomment-1859186991","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1957","id":1859186991,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArxUbc5u0PEv","user":{"login":"j143","id":53068787,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMDY4Nzg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53068787?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143","html_url":"https://github.com/j143","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-17T14:23:53Z","updated_at":"2023-12-17T14:23:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @MaximilianSchreff , thanks a lot for working on this.

The buffer pool anyway assigns a unique cache file ID.\r\n\r\nI was probably wrong in my original guess, and I do not know the internals for the pool enough to say if that was it, but we tend for the workers to use up the resources, and having multiple workers use the same source file, and cache the reading of the same path and file seems a likely course to me as any. Especially if one of the workers fails and crashes then we do not get the error out , and instead, the test just runs forever until timeout. It seems like GitHub changed some settings for the workers that provoked this.\r\n\r\n> I always found the multi-threaded federated tests to be more stable than the multi-process tests.\r\n\r\nI agree with this statement. especially now when I am trying to convert them all to multi-process.  I found out today that Microsoft reduced the memory from 8GB to 7GB for the default nodes that we tested with. We allocate 3gXmx for each worker and many tests use 4 workers. there is nothing written to the log if a worker crashes and the tests are not written in ways that inform us if this happens it just times out. \r\n\r\nhttps://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners\r\n\r\n\r\n> I could imagine that using multiple ports for all workers in the same JVM might have been an issue in this changed test environment.\r\n\r\nCan be that they limited the range of ports allowed to be used. but I do not think so since we choose random ports in the allowed range, and I have disabled the parallel running of multiple federated tests at the same time.\r\n\r\nI am trying to make the tests more robust to crashing workers, and hopefully, this fixes the problems.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/1871229023/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/1871494831","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/1963#issuecomment-1871494831","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1963","id":1871494831,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArxUbc5vjL6v","user":{"login":"Baunsgaard","id":9947148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5NDcxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9947148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard","html_url":"https://github.com/Baunsgaard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-28T21:15:55Z","updated_at":"2023-12-28T21:15:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@dependabot

\r\nAbout the Queue - previously, we iterated through all variables and counted the number of cacheable objects. This was done to calculate the size of the boolean array but in a shallow manner. With the changes, we would now need to iterate through every single variable, i.e. laso recursively for lists, in order to get the size. That is why I chose a dynamic data structure. I'm not sure whether this is faster though. Since the number of live variables per function call is usually pretty low, I wasn't able to see any performance differences.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/1872539125/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/1872539593","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/1957#issuecomment-1872539593","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1957","id":1872539593,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArxUbc5vnK_J","user":{"login":"MaximilianSchreff","id":111394953,"node_id":"U_kgDOBqPAiQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/111394953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaximilianSchreff","html_url":"https://github.com/MaximilianSchreff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaximilianSchreff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaximilianSchreff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaximilianSchreff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaximilianSchreff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaximilianSchreff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaximilianSchreff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaximilianSchreff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaximilianSchreff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaximilianSchreff/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-30T14:37:36Z","updated_at":"2023-12-30T14:37:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@j143 Thank you for the feedback!\r\nI'm still developing the backward pass for the models.

None of the elements inside `org.apache.sysds.performance` are run on GitHub because they all are performance related, therefore, you do not need to comment your elements out.\r\n2. The `org.apache.sysds.performance` package is intended to be run independently of the maven test framework, because the testing framework incurs overhead in the execution making the tests more inconsistent in performance numbers.\r\n\r\nI suggest taking a look at the README how the performance tests were intended to be run:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/systemds/blob/main/src/test/java/org/apache/sysds/performance/README.md\r\n\r\nIf you want to make the changes to not run though the JUnit test framework, you can take a number for your specific runs in the Main file, and hook them up to your tests:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/systemds/blob/9f82e9f675c567c7f80360f3814e3a19138d7a62/src/test/java/org/apache/sysds/performance/Main.java#L104\r\n\r\nI suggest taking something like 1000, 1001, 1002 etc. to not overlap with some other numbers.\r\n\r\nBest regards\r\nSebastian\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/1911046757/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/1911146545","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/1989#issuecomment-1911146545","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1989","id":1911146545,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArxUbc5x6cgx","user":{"login":"Jaybit0","id":52833175,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODMzMTc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52833175?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jaybit0","html_url":"https://github.com/Jaybit0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jaybit0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jaybit0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jaybit0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jaybit0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jaybit0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jaybit0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jaybit0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jaybit0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jaybit0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-25T23:14:35Z","updated_at":"2024-01-25T23:14:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the clarification.
