This optimization does not make much sense. In the same constructor, some use `addSystemTopic` and some don't call it, which leads to troublesome understanding instead.\r\n\r\nHi @echooymxq  IMO,It's not that it's not added to the collection, it's already added. You don't have to repeat the work just to reinforce understanding. Understanding the code will reveal that the system topics have already been added to the collection in the static code block of the TopicValidator. I think the code should be kept as simple and concise as possible to minimize repetitive code.

@lironghai 你上面的例子就是一个标签，只是你标签用了分隔符分割。 如果你一定需要用tag来区分，消费设置tag=*， 然后将消息的tag拿出来进行比对。如果满足你的这个消费组的需求你就消费，不满足就丢弃这样也是可以的。正常来说tag不同应该消息体也不一样。\r\n\r\n您说的对的，一条消息的标签是拼接多个的；  我举个简单场景例子可能我的理解有问题：\r\n例如这条消息是一个快照消息，这个快照需要执行多个分析处理，而每次执行的检测都是不同的是动态的，每个检测都是不同的服务并不是集成在一起的，所以需要多个消费者组来处理自己需要的类型消息；\r\n\r\n因为我们的消息可能会比较大，可能是图片快照的base64，如果每个消费组都接收带宽和brocker的传输压力都很大，所以期望还是通过mq来处理这件事情；\r\n当然我也考虑过将标签细化一次只设置一个，但是这就导致再生产者需要推送多次，这明显不太合理；目前我们折中的处理方式是使用sql92通过设置不同key来区分处理，但其实这些key都是tag细化的标签，都是同一类属性应该放在一个字段中，但是目前sql92的过滤并不支持数组类型。\r\n\r\n\r\n之前我们使用的是rabbitmq，它可以同步多级队列名称和队列路由的通配符进行匹配分发，但是切换到rocketmq这种消费的分发复制只能借助消费者组和tag来进行匹配。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1414691513/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1414731407","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/5966#issuecomment-1414731407","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/5966","id":1414731407,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl85UUxaP","user":{"login":"lironghai","id":34302941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MzAyOTQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34302941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lironghai","html_url":"https://github.com/lironghai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lironghai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lironghai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lironghai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lironghai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lironghai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lironghai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lironghai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lironghai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lironghai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-03T02:48:56Z","updated_at":"2023-02-03T02:48:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":">

5.0 实现定时消息功能通过延迟队列和磁盘存储两种方式来实现。在内存中有一个延迟队列，它维护着所有的延迟消息，这些消息会在到达指定的延迟时间后被发送。定时任务会定期扫描延迟队列，将到期的消息发送出去。但是，如果延迟队列存储的消息太多，不可能全部存储在内存中。所以部分消息会存储到磁盘上。对于磁盘上的消息，RocketMQ会采用分块存储的方式，并使用二进制堆结构将其按照时间戳排序。这样可以避免频繁的磁盘读写操作，提高系统的性能。\r\n\r\n是这样做的吗","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1416777531/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1416893937","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/5985#issuecomment-1416893937","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/5985","id":1416893937,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl85UdBXx","user":{"login":"mxsm","id":15797831,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzk3ODMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15797831?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxsm","html_url":"https://github.com/mxsm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxsm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxsm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxsm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxsm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxsm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxsm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxsm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxsm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxsm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-05T01:22:18Z","updated_at":"2023-02-05T01:22:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@rockit-ba
