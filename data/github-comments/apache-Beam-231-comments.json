It was requested that there be a single profile with two executions.\r\n\r\nVersion 2: One profile, one Jenkins job, hence one set of pipeline options, two executions and a Java system property to force streaming mode since the pipeline options had to be the same. It took too long. Even bumping the timeout would just mean waiting many hours.\r\n\r\nVersion 3 (current): One profile, two executions, each has the ability to be skipped, two Jenkins jobs that each select an execution.\r\n\r\nI left it with one set of test pipeline options and the Java system property.
