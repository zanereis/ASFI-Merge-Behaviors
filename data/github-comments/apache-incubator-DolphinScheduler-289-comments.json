I understand that 11402 could allow users to modify the configs without restarting the components and the configs can be reloaded at runtime. \r\n\r\nBut my point is that if users use `Helm` to deploy DS in a k8s cluster and he wants to modify some configs (E.g., the `root directory` of zookeeper in `application.yaml`) **before deploying the DS**. \r\n\r\nIn this case, DS cannot apply some configuration modifications at startup unless he modifies the configuration file in the docker image (**Some configurations cannot be specified via** `values.yaml`). E.g., he modifies the `application.yaml` and  **rebuilds the docker image** with `ADD application.yaml to /opt/dolphinscheduler/conf` in `Dockerfile`.\r\n\r\nThis PR mainly mounts the configuration directory through `configmap` so that users can **avoid rebuilding the docker image** if he wants to modify the configs before deploying DS to k8s through `Helm`. As for 11402, users can still modify the configs without restarting the components and the configs can be reloaded at runtime.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1221711238/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1221717291","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/11583#issuecomment-1221717291","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/11583","id":1221717291,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms5I0e0r","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-22T02:25:06Z","updated_at":"2022-08-22T02:25:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you for your feedback, we have received your issue, Please wait patiently for a reply.\n* In order for us to understand your request as soon as possible, please provide detailed information、version or pictures.\n* If you haven't received a reply for a long time, you can [join our slack](https://s.apache.org/dolphinscheduler-slack) and send your question to channel `#troubleshooting`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1221717291/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1221734335","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/pull/11571#issuecomment-1221734335","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/11571","id":1221734335,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms5I0i-_","user":{"login":"EricGao888","id":34905992,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTA1OTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34905992?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EricGao888","html_url":"https://github.com/EricGao888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EricGao888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EricGao888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EricGao888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EricGao888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EricGao888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EricGao888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EricGao888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EricGao888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EricGao888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-22T02:58:53Z","updated_at":"2022-08-22T02:58:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> @EricGao888 hi bro,I merged the code locally and resubmitted it.Please check it for me.
