Oh, in that case, wouldn't we have to stop the flow of new records/messages into the ledgers? From the approach you described, what we should do is basically stop all flow of new data from Producer to the partitions we wish to delete, finish processing the data that is still there, then delete them. \r\n\r\nThe most straightforward approach to deleting the partitions is as follows: if there was originally N partitions, and the user specifies us for K partitions, where K < N, we just delete the last N-K partitions (i.e. the ones with the biggest indexes). The partitions which are to be deleted I think would be made read-only once the user requests them to be deleted.

I agree some refactoring can and should be done to make runtimes more modular and the code between all of these runtimes to be not sprinkled everywhere in the code.\r\n\r\nI can definitely seen the confusion here with the overloaded term \"runtime\".  We have a interface call Runtime and we have an enum called Runtime but they refer to different things.  The former refers more to a Runtime Environment and the later refers to a Runtime language.  We can discuss how we can rename to eliminate this confusion.
