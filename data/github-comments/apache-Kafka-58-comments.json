We need to think of an ideal solution for heart beating consumers while doing blocking operations, probably with @hachikuji 's help editing consumer APIs.\n\nSome general feedbacks about this PR:\n1. I think it may be OK to do the initialization upon getStore(), instead of each of its operations, since it is usually the case that the processors which needs access to the state store will read / write to it upon getting the first record. But by doing this in getStore we can simply the refactoring a log, like not introducing the `maybeGetPartitions` function.\n2. With the above approach, we can get rid of the `initializeStateStores` function, hence we can do the `initializeOffsetLimits` and the full `init(context, store)` call with register in the `getStore` function.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/210658102/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/210669650","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1200#issuecomment-210669650","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1200","id":210669650,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMDY2OTY1MA==","user":{"login":"Ishiihara","id":1189848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODk4NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1189848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ishiihara","html_url":"https://github.com/Ishiihara","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ishiihara/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ishiihara/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ishiihara/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ishiihara/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ishiihara/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ishiihara/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ishiihara/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ishiihara/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ishiihara/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-15T22:29:03Z","updated_at":"2016-04-15T22:29:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ewencp PTAL\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/210669650/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/210673959","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1200#issuecomment-210673959","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1200","id":210673959,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMDY3Mzk1OQ==","user":{"login":"ewencp","id":47366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp","html_url":"https://github.com/ewencp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-15T22:50:55Z","updated_at":"2016-04-15T22:50:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/210673959/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/210685709","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1229#issuecomment-210685709","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1229","id":210685709,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMDY4NTcwOQ==","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-15T23:40:25Z","updated_at":"2016-04-15T23:40:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"1.

Have a look at the latest commit on handling connector initialization failures. It seemed convenient to handle failures similarly to how we handle them in the tasks: i.e. we treat initialization failures identically to startup or runtime failures and leave the connector in a persistent failed state. Otherwise, you need to invent a new \"defunct\" state which prohibits startup (since we wouldn't want to even try starting a connector if it failed to initialize). This means that the user must use /restart to restart a failed connector, which is a little different from the initial patch which allowed the usage of /resume to restart a failed connector.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/212260577/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/212283984","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1087#issuecomment-212283984","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1087","id":212283984,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMjI4Mzk4NA==","user":{"login":"Ishiihara","id":1189848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODk4NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1189848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ishiihara","html_url":"https://github.com/Ishiihara","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ishiihara/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ishiihara/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ishiihara/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ishiihara/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ishiihara/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ishiihara/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ishiihara/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ishiihara/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ishiihara/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-20T06:47:06Z","updated_at":"2016-04-20T06:47:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@hachikuji The exception handling looks good.
