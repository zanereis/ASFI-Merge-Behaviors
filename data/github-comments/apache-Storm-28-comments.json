I have a few suggestions though.\n\nThe first is with the 'done' callback.  I can see how it is needed to support async processing, but for me it feels like it is not likely to be too common, but then again I have not done anything significant with javascript and nothing with nodejs so I just don't know with the libraries are like.\n\nMy other issue is around packaging and testing.  If we are going to officially support nodejs as an execution environment similar to how we support python and ruby I would like to see us running unit tests with it like we do with python and ruby.  I would also like to see it packaged and distributed with storm, and not in the resources of storm-starter.\n\nAlternatively we could set it up as a separate jar similar to the kafka spout, that would have the storm.js in the resources directory, and then ask users to add it as a maven dependency when packaging their own topologies.  Either way though I would like to see us test this.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/50084060/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612476845","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4241#issuecomment-2612476845","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4241","id":2612476845,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI0NzY4NDU=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-24T21:59:41Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T12:59:38Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=githubbot\">githubbot</a>:</i>\n<p>Github user asfgit closed the pull request at:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/incubator-storm/pull/183\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/incubator-storm/pull/183</a></p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612476845/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612476849","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4241#issuecomment-2612476849","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4241","id":2612476849,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI0NzY4NDk=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-24T22:03:44Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T12:59:38Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=dagit\">dagit</a>:</i>\n<p>Thanks, Curtis.

See for example http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_readfile_filename_options_callback \nSince the ISpout and IBolt methods are \"void methods\" the nodejs callback equivalent only receives one argument (error if exists) and does not receive a second argument (return value). Hence this method may sometimes be called \"done\" instead of \"callback\".\nAnother approach would be to use Promise objects (such as whenjs), however these means adding an opinionated dependency. Most promise libraries have \"lift\" method that converts standard nodejs async functions into their promise equivalents.\nAnother approach would be using the nodejs on event pattern, but we tried to stick to the python implementation as much as we could, so we haven not considered it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/50172761/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/50173838","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/205#issuecomment-50173838","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/205","id":50173838,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMTczODM4","user":{"login":"revans2","id":3441321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDEzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3441321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2","html_url":"https://github.com/revans2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-25T16:38:51Z","updated_at":"2014-07-25T16:38:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"That change looks simple enough.

But that is kind of what I want.  It becomes a balancing  act between convenience/insecurity and security/inconvenience.  I just feel nervous that anything on the classpath the user gets to decide to load it into memory. It feels like it is too open ended, but honestly if you feel strongly about it I will not push it.  I would just want the config changed so that it is prefixed with topology instead of nimbus so that it is obvious that it is a topology specific config.</p>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612469606/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612469609","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4188#issuecomment-2612469609","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4188","id":2612469609,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI0Njk2MDk=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-25T19:29:44Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T12:55:42Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=githubbot\">githubbot</a>:</i>\n<p>Github user Parth-Brahmbhatt commented on a diff in the pull request:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/incubator-storm/pull/190#discussion_r15419864\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/incubator-storm/pull/190#discussion_r15419864</a></p>\n\n<p>    &#8212; Diff: storm-core/src/clj/backtype/storm/daemon/nimbus.clj &#8212;<br/>\n    @@ -1046,7 +1047,10 @@<br/>\n     (dissoc storm-conf STORM-ZOOKEEPER-TOPOLOGY-AUTH-SCHEME STORM-ZOOKEEPER-TOPOLOGY-AUTH-PAYLOAD))<br/>\n     total-storm-conf (merge conf storm-conf)<br/>\n     topology (normalize-topology total-storm-conf topology)<br/>\n    +nimbus-autocred-plugins (AuthUtils/getNimbusAutoCredPlugins total-storm-conf)<br/>\n    &#8212; End diff &#8211;</p>\n\n<p>    I can see how this can be a security hole when the user passes his own implementation and act as nimbus to get delegation tokens as some other user.
