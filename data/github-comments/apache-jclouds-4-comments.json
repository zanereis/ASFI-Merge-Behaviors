Steffen Gürtler,\nI did the pull request for the encoding with Base64Url, because with Base64 i got an error similar to yours.\n\nBase64Url is meant to ensure you can use the string in urls.\n\nThe string you have contains a minus sign, so this is indeed Base64Url, and not Base64, so my fix is in there.\n\nYour problem looks very similar to mine, so is it maybe the \"==\" this time?\n\n \n\nBTW, while changing the code i wondered if we could implement makeBlockId() by using String.valueOf() instead,\n\nwhich is much simpler code, a shorter string, and uses only digits (as Block-ID is an integer and probably positive)\n\nFeel free to try that, and if it helps you can maybe also remove that not-so-helpful test I added.\n\n \n\nAndrew Gaul will then hopefully approve your pull request.\n\n \n\nGood luck!\n\n    ChJung1\n\n \n\nGesendet: Dienstag, 25.
