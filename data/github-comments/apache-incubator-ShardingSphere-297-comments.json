The example enhancement is completed nearly.\r\n> \r\n> There are still some tasks need to be done:\r\n> \r\n> 1. `product`, `mode` and `transaction` in config.yaml could be use multiple values, it is better to name them as `products`, `modes` and `transactions`.\r\n> 2. I noticed that example of Proxy can not use mix rule configuration, maybe we can improve it to keep same as JDBC.\r\n> 3. The data model is for config loading and template together, we can consider about split them, just add a config object to load config.yaml only. The config.yaml can generate lots of examples, so the config object can derive lots of data model objects.\r\n> 4. It is better to add verification for `config.yaml`, to reminder the config error to end users.\r\n> 5. We can remove or deprecated the original examples if our new examples are ready.\r\n\r\nIt's my pleasure, I will continue to push forward and continue to improve related functions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/1079721715/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/1079750177","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/pull/16401#issuecomment-1079750177","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/16401","id":1079750177,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAvkN_M5AW64h","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-26T18:33:01Z","updated_at":"2022-03-28T05:25:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#

@sandynz, Have you considered the problem of 10000 databases in the same physical database instance, which means that 10000 database connection pools need to be created. It does exist in our online environment. The current way of binding data sources to physical databases is unreasonable when the same database instance is used for many databases. I think database connections should not be bound to databases, but should correspond to database instances, A database instance can create one or more connection pools, which can be determined by the configuration.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/1079822432/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/1079826907","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/16385#issuecomment-1079826907","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/16385","id":1079826907,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAvkN_M5AXNnb","user":{"login":"zhaojinchao95","id":33742097,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzQyMDk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33742097?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaojinchao95","html_url":"https://github.com/zhaojinchao95","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaojinchao95/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaojinchao95/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaojinchao95/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaojinchao95/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaojinchao95/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaojinchao95/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaojinchao95/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaojinchao95/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaojinchao95/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-27T03:05:29Z","updated_at":"2022-03-27T03:05:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Hello, i notice that the SchemaMetaDataNode.getFullMetaDataPath() is a private method, so how am i supposed to call it from the test class?
