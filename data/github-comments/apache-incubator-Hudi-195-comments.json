If multiple sources update a single target, set an independent checkpoint for each source so that each source can recover from any checkpoint. I only changed the methods for calculating resumeCheckpointStr and saving checkpoints to checkpointCommitMetadata in DeltaSync. Specifically, I added these methods. This does not affect the calculation logic when a single source updates a single target.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1017058557/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1017075893","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/3879#issuecomment-1017075893","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3879","id":1017075893,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM48n1i1","user":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-20T03:09:16Z","updated_at":"2022-01-20T03:27:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"May I know whats the partition path field I should be choosing while writing to hudi ? and I assume record key is UUID and preCombine field is SORT_KEY. \r\n\r\n```\r\nspark.sql(\"describe tbl1\").show()\r\n+--------+---------+-------+\r\n|col_name|data_type|comment|\r\n+--------+---------+-------+\r\n|    UUID|   string|   null|\r\n|       A|   string|   null|\r\n|       B|timestamp|   null|\r\n|       C|   string|   null|\r\n|       D|      int|   null|\r\n|       E|timestamp|   null|\r\n|       F|   string|   null|\r\n|       G|timestamp|   null|\r\n|SORT_KEY|timestamp|   null|\r\n+--------+---------+-------+\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1017075893/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1017082441","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/3745#issuecomment-1017082441","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3745","id":1017082441,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM48n3JJ","user":{"login":"YannByron","id":10036681,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDM2Njgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10036681?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannByron","html_url":"https://github.com/YannByron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannByron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannByron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannByron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannByron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannByron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannByron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannByron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannByron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannByron/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-20T03:24:14Z","updated_at":"2022-01-20T03:24:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @YannByron thanks for the review. can you take it from here please? from the reproducing steps, looks like a different bug where primary key and other properties were not respected by HMS?\r\n\r\n@xushiyan ok, i'll take this. \r\nAnd it'a real different case, better to create another pr and ticket.

As long as the attributes are completely consistent, it is essentially the same as sync hive\r\n\r\nthanks for the replies. I tried using hudi createTable sql command but getting \r\n```\r\nException = MetaException(message:Got exception: java.io.IOException Error accessing gs://*\r\n```\r\nI also tried using saveAsTable but seems like there might be some issue with hive config which causes\r\n```\r\nException = Invalid host name: local host is:\r\n```\r\nI will try to resolve these once I get back to work and see if the entity table would solve the mergeInto issue.

For an empty table, with this pr, sql layer can use the `EmptyRelation` to solve the failure of read this table.\r\n\r\nThe pr I submitted to your `firstWriteFailReadFix` branch should fix the sql analysis failure, like `org.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Cannot resolve 'h0.id in (`s0.id` = `h0.id`), the input columns is: [id#5461, name#5462, price#5463, ts#5464, flag#5465];`.\r\n\r\nFor table created by spark-sql, there is the right schema persisted in `hoodie.properties`. Even if data fails to be written at the next commit, the schema should be retrieved correctly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1017332353/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1017333029","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/4628#issuecomment-1017333029","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4628","id":1017333029,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM48o0Ul","user":{"login":"codope","id":16440354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQwMzU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16440354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope","html_url":"https://github.com/codope","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-20T10:32:04Z","updated_at":"2022-01-20T10:32:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@kywe665 @nsivabalan Addressed all comments.
