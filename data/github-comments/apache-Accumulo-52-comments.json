You don't need to force-push when update the PR. In fact, it actually makes it harder to review, because it GitHub sends notifications to followers showing the diff between the current code and the previous... but that link doesn't work on force-pushes, because the earlier commits are no longer present. When it comes time to merge, we'll squash it all down to one, anyway, so it's better to just add commits instead of force-pushing.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/687971050/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/687980505","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/1701#issuecomment-687980505","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1701","id":687980505,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4Nzk4MDUwNQ==","user":{"login":"jkosh44","id":10800303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODAwMzAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10800303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44","html_url":"https://github.com/jkosh44","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-07T02:11:16Z","updated_at":"2020-09-07T02:11:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ctubbsii Sorry about the force pushing, bad habits.

I was trying to track down this a bit, because it didn't make sense to me that the two methods that previously updated the `LAST` location would be doing that. I traced the code and saw that the two methods in `MasterMetadataUtil` that update `LocationType.LAST` are only ever called by `DatafileManager.bringMinorCompactionOnline` and `DatafileManager.bringMajorCompactionOnline`.\r\n\r\nSo, it seems that the original intent (prior to #1616) was to *only* update the `LAST` location if a file was successfully written locally on that server. So, `LAST` does *not* represent the last assignment, but the last server where data was written from a major or minor compaction. The intent, it seems, is that the initial assignments on startup should be based on where the data would be local, and not to preserve its previous assignment.\r\n\r\nThis insight also answers the questions I had in https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/1616#issuecomment-665412742 about the intent of the `LAST` field. Because, if the intent was to simply assign to the last location it was previously assigned to, then assigning it to the last `CURRENT` location that was written would be sufficient (because that is updated on assignment), and we wouldn't even need a `LAST` location at all. `LAST` does not mean \"last assignment\", it means \"last location where data was likely written locally\". This is about data locality, not (re)assignment thrashing.\r\n\r\nSo, we need to go back to the drawing board here, because I'm not sure #1616 even fixed a problem at all... it simply changed behavior to re-assign to a previously assigned location, rather than the last location written to. We need to figure out if the code works as intended *without* the changes in #1616. If it does, then we need to figure out whether we want to change the behavior or not. If we do, then we can probably change the code to eliminate the `LAST` field entirely, and just use the `CURRENT` field, if it exists. If we don't want to change the behavior, then we can revert #1616 and simply do the changes that get rid of some boilerplate by using Ample.\r\n\r\nDoes all this make sense, @Manno15 \r\nIf not, feel free to give me a call or ping me on Slack.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/691274564/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/691281245","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/1653#issuecomment-691281245","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1653","id":691281245,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5MTI4MTI0NQ==","user":{"login":"Manno15","id":29436247,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NDM2MjQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29436247?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manno15","html_url":"https://github.com/Manno15","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manno15/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manno15/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manno15/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manno15/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manno15/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manno15/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manno15/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manno15/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manno15/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-11T19:46:31Z","updated_at":"2020-09-11T19:46:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ctubbsii Yes, that makes sense.

I don't know if it is necessary to handle the RuntimeExceptions thrown by Ample and rewrapped as DistributedStoreException, or not... especially since Ample itself is written to wrap all checked exceptions and throw them through as RuntimeExceptions. If Ample doesn't think they should be handled, then maybe these stores shouldn't handle them either.

With the trial of never reaching the limit being the quickest. \r\n\r\nThe issues I faced were in getting the amount of delete candidates and more importantly the candidate length long enough without my cluster of computers crashing or running out of memory. I was never able to have a trial where the batch size limit greater than 12MB was reached. \r\n\r\nFrom my actual trials, with 75k delete candidates, a batch size of 12MB completed on average of 34 seconds. Which was the quickest. At the same amount of candidates, a batch size of 2 MB completed in 58 seconds. That's a decent amount of time difference for such a small difference in batch size. I would like to revisit this eventually and give it a full range of tests with batch sizes ranging from at least 12 MB to128 MB.

It seems the trigger is that the dynamic classloader starts to thrash, continually reloading - I then suspect that this is consuming memory or other resources until things fail.  One thing that sets off the classloader is when new jars are deployed in hdfs for the system, but then its only one or two servers that get into this state.  On an another occasion, it was on a server restart.  \r\n\r\nI'd like to treat the classloader as a separate issue, The classloader issue may be a trigger, but the fact that the tserver can get into this state and write corrupt files probably should be addressed, even if that one trigger is eliminated, maybe there are others?\r\n\r\nThe stacktrace points to the NullPointer coming from the Tables.exists() call - I'll work on getting a more detailed representation of it.\r\n\r\nIts clear that the tserver is unhealthy, and I agree, I am skeptical of Tables.exits returning a null, but if things are that bad, then I was trying to see if there was an approach that, philosophically, would pull the plug to eliminate or at least greatly reduce the blast footprint.\r\n\r\nThe thing is that eventually the tserver does seem to die with a segfault - but only after a lengthy time (days) and the potential for corrupt files being written and causing data loss the whole time the tserver is in this state.  The bad files are only uncovered during the next compaction, so there is quite a delay between when the damage occurred and when Accumulo reports an issue other than in the tserver logs.  To find the problem, it is necessary to take the file reported as corrupt (it shows up in the UI error log) and then grep across all of the tserver log files looking for the compaction plan log message that created said file.\r\n\r\nOther than the corrupted files, the tserver seems to be operating normally - but that might not be a correct assumption - there are no other indications of errors - but that might be different than operating as intended. The delay for discovery does not help in answering this question.\r\n\r\nAs far as 2.x - 1) again, not sure how to reliably trigger this. 2) with 2.x there could be an entirely different approach. \r\n\r\nThere is an open issue - https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/946 that could be implemented to achieve this.  My thought was that if the tserver knew that it needed a memory manager thread and that thread dies, then the tserver could take action - to either re-spawn an new process or terminate itself.  If the tserver was aware, then throwing an exception that kills the thread would be appropriate.  As it is now, I think that if the memory manager thread dies, the tserver would not know and that seemed like a sub-optimal condition, so I was exploring if it could be appropriate to kill the server directly - and removing the lock was the most direct way that I thought of.\r\n\r\nImplementing critical thread monitoring and recovery would be more comprehensive and probably a better approach - but the changes would be significant enough that I would not call them a bug fix.  Being that this is happening on 1.9.3 and was not addressed in 1.10, I think a bug fix is appropriate and necessary. Being that this has the potential for data loss, having an fix in 1.10.1 would likely be suitable for people to back port and patch - and I suspect the desire for that is more immediate than could be achieved by starting with 2.x as the target.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/694639463/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/694666753","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1689#issuecomment-694666753","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1689","id":694666753,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5NDY2Njc1Mw==","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-18T05:46:03Z","updated_at":"2020-09-18T05:46:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Ugh. Classloaders. If you can't trust your class loader, you can't trust anything. I don't know how we can reasonably protect against class loader problems... because those can cause problems *anywhere* in our code, including any code we write to try to guard against problems.\r\n\r\nAnother possible issue is the attempting to catch Throwable and handle it... which could include unrecoverable Errors. We may be causing more problems than we are solving by catching things like `OutOfMemoryError` and trying to do something to handle it. IMO, we should never catch Throwable, unless we're going to immediately halt the JVM.

This looks like it was triggered by a bad VFS classloader configuration. Maybe that'd be a good place to guard against. It'd be very hard to protect code against a bad classloader... because it could be doing bad things anywhere. But, it should be possible to protect the classloader from bad configuration / user error.\r\n\r\n> 16:53:22,105 - ERROR: memory manager failed null.\r\n> 16:53:22,105 - First memory manager failed.\r\n\r\nI don't recognize either of these two messages, and cannot find anything in the 1.9.3 code that looks like these messages.

However, I can see no way that would be possible unless the ZooKeeper client threads were somehow also in a bad state. If that's the case, then while you saw this error occur in the memory manager... it could actually occur pretty much anywhere. I wonder: were the ZooKeeper jars being loaded via the reloading VFS classloader? If so, that might be a ready explanation for how the ZooKeeper code failed here as a consequence of a bug or failure condition in that classloader, and indicate that the underlying issue is that classloader, and that this stack trace might be a red herring.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/695053928/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/696159392","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1689#issuecomment-696159392","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1689","id":696159392,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5NjE1OTM5Mg==","user":{"login":"EdColeman","id":7047700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDc3MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7047700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman","html_url":"https://github.com/EdColeman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-21T14:39:39Z","updated_at":"2020-09-21T14:39:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The errors listed in the summary are my summary descriptions - the actual errors where in the stack trace.  \r\n\r\nThe Invalid URI error occurred hours after the memory manager failed, so it does not seem to indicate that would be the trigger.\r\n\r\nI do not know if the master lock / fail over is common to each occurrence - I noted it here in case it was significant, but I cannot say it was common.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/696159392/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/696160463","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1689#issuecomment-696160463","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1689","id":696160463,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5NjE2MDQ2Mw==","user":{"login":"EdColeman","id":7047700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDc3MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7047700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman","html_url":"https://github.com/EdColeman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-21T14:41:21Z","updated_at":"2020-09-21T14:41:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Zookeeper \"should\" not be reloading - I believe the jar that changes are custom iterators.

However, given the direction we're headed regarding the classloader changes (see mailing list for discussion about that), I'm not sure what changes to the existing classloader, if any, would be worth it at this time.\r\n\r\nRelated issue: we should really stop trying to catch `Throwable`... and limit ourselves to catching `Exception`, at most (preferably more narrow than that, if possible).

According [to Oracle's troubleshooting guide](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/troubleshoot/memleaks002.html), this may be thrown when there's not enough native memory to load a class.... which is a situation that seems like it could cause the reloading behavior you saw, as well as other memory corruption issues, if we didn't just exit immediately and instead try to \"handle\" it and continue after hitting an `OutOfMemoryError`.\r\n\r\nWere there low-memory issues on the machine(s) where you saw this occur?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/696407230/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/696422426","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1689#issuecomment-696422426","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1689","id":696422426,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5NjQyMjQyNg==","user":{"login":"EdColeman","id":7047700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDc3MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7047700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman","html_url":"https://github.com/EdColeman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-21T22:57:09Z","updated_at":"2020-09-21T22:57:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looking at the log messages for server.GarbageCollectionLogger the collection times for ConcurrentMarkAndSweep are 0.11 and its reporting plenty of free memory.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/696422426/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/696434005","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1689#issuecomment-696434005","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1689","id":696434005,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5NjQzNDAwNQ==","user":{"login":"EdColeman","id":7047700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDc3MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7047700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman","html_url":"https://github.com/EdColeman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-21T23:30:23Z","updated_at":"2020-09-21T23:30:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Overall, there may be a difference in philosophy or focus.

I do not disagree with the premises of anything that you wrote - except I think I'm coming at it from a different angle.\r\n\r\nYour approach just feels to me like trying to protect against sun damage by applying sunscreen to burnt areas as they occur... rather than taking the time to set up an umbrella to stop the underlying cause.\r\n\r\n> 1. So, in general - for cases where we are catching `Throwable ` and that is causing issues, - would it be better if we stopped the tserver?\r\n\r\nYes, I think we should stop the tserver. We should let `Error` fall through and only catch regular `Throwable`s (`Exception`s), and we should set up an uncaught exception handler on all threads to and terminate if we see anything fall through, as we should write our code protectively so that this never happens unless there's an unrecoverable error.\r\n\r\n> 2. If it is determined that we want to stop, is deleting the lock acceptable, or is there a preferred, alternate method.\r\n\r\nI don't see much value in trying to remove the ZK lock. Leaving the tserver up long enough to try to connect to ZK is likely to leave it running long enough to do more harm than good, even if it works... which it may not. Remember, the failure scenario in the stack trace above showed ZK returning something that should have been impossible. If ZK is doing impossible things, what are the chances it's healthy enough to delete the lock? Not good, I think, and not worth the risk.\r\n\r\nI think it'd be better for the tserver to just die, and the lock to be released after it expires, as designed, and the master to reassign tablets after that. This is less code complexity, and won't leave the tserver running to do damage.\r\n\r\n> While the general issue of catching and swallowing Throwable is a bigger issue - for this one case where we can identify a case that this is not appropriate - can we fix that and then examine the larger issue as time allows or when other cases are identified?\r\n\r\nI don't see it as a tenable approach to chase these down one a time. The sunburn can occur anywhere. We should be setting up the umbrella, rather than patching with sunscreen after each burn.\r\n\r\nAlong with the above approaches for dealing with `Throwable`, I think people should understand that VFS class reloading, especially over a network from HDFS, is *not* a reliable method for deploying their code, and it has never quite worked

As we suspected, the issue is related to jcommander update. The previous version of jcommander(v1.48) seem to ignore empty arguments, this behaviour has been changed through https://github.com/cbeust/jcommander/pull/311 and jc no longer ignores empty arguments. I will PR this one soon. \r\nAlso, I'm working on updating `$ACCUMULO_HOME/bin/tool.sh` script to use `zookeeper-*.jar` files from `$ZOOKEEPER_HOME/lib` directory for ZK versions >= 3.5. This is another issue that we ran into whilst testing 1.10 RC2, at the time we manually copied the jar files out of the `/lib` directory. I'll create a separate issue for this and a separate PR. Also, I'll verify the `accumulo-testing` suite as well.
