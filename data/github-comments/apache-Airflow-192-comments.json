Make sure that we first always pull the base image. Having `docker build --pull` normally. So we always build from the latest base image.

It won't change DockerHub build behaviour as they are always starting from a clean docker when building image (to get repeatable builds). But it's good for anyone building it on their own environment which might not be clean.\r\n\r\nAs far as why `apt-get upgrade -y` is a bad idea - i am not sure any of the comments in the Stack Overflow question you copied actually say that. And I am not sure how `docker build --pull` is tied with not having to use `apt-get upgrade`. Just `build --pull` is not solving all security issues - it only forces rebuild when there is an update to the python3.6-slim base image which is happenning every few weeks - mostly because new python3.6 minor version has been relased or pip version upgraded. We are installing a lot more via apt-get and using apt-get upgrade is a good idea to keep (for security mostly).\r\n\r\nPlus if we are really concerned that building from the scratch might not work for some people, why don't we simply run two image builds in parallel - latest (using the cache) and latest-clean (without cache - similar as release builds). This way we can be notified immediately when the \"clean\" build goes out of sync with the cached one enough that it starts to fail (which should be extremely rare if at all taking into account that we will be rebuilding the whole image from the scratch always when new python version gets released and when we do a release candidate of a new release). And if we find any issue and fix it - we can (after fixing it) force-rebuild latest image by increasing the vairiable in docker file.\r\n\r\nIn my latest PR change I did exactly this - whenever \"release\" or \"latest-clean\" image is build I replace --cache-from with --no-cache option and if we configure those parallel builds (i did it in my dockerhub ) - they will all be built in parallel -  but then latest will be using cache which is benefitial for the users downloading it regularly.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/455904301/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/455914575","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4292#issuecomment-455914575","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4292","id":455914575,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NTkxNDU3NQ==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-20T23:54:37Z","updated_at":"2019-01-23T12:53:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/4292?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#4292](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/4292?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/commit/0d7ece3da6edd71007f70a0ccf5dc1a9f9d28f86?src=pr&el=desc) will **decrease** coverage by `0.07%`.\n> The diff coverage is `100%`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/4292/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=WdLKlKHOAU&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/4292?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@            Coverage Diff             @@\n##           master    #4292      +/-   ##\n==========================================\n- Coverage    74.1%   74.03%   -0.08%     \n==========================================\n  Files         421      421              \n  Lines       27681    28059     +378     \n==========================================\n+ Hits        20514    20773     +259     \n- Misses       7167     7286     +119\n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/4292?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [airflow/models/\\_\\_init\\_\\_.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/4292/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9tb2RlbHMvX19pbml0X18ucHk=) | `92.5% <100%> (+0.16%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [airflow/contrib/hooks/gcp\\_dataflow\\_hook.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/4292/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9jb250cmliL2hvb2tzL2djcF9kYXRhZmxvd19ob29rLnB5) | `75.75% <0%> (ø)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [airflow/bin/cli.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/4292/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9iaW4vY2xpLnB5) | `66.06% <0%> (+1.41%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [airflow/contrib/hooks/bigquery\\_hook.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/4292/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9jb250cmliL2hvb2tzL2JpZ3F1ZXJ5X2hvb2sucHk=) | `58.36% <0%> (+2.34%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [airflow/contrib/hooks/gcp\\_api\\_base\\_hook.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/4292/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9jb250cmliL2hvb2tzL2djcF9hcGlfYmFzZV9ob29rLnB5) | `81.39% <0%> (+3.78%)` | :arrow_up: |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/4292?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/4292?src=pr&el=footer).

I will show you some working examples/POC shortly of where the full control over caching works with real DockerHub setup. I takes a bit of time to iterate with DockerHub builds as they take some time, but I think it will get there shortly. \r\n\r\nJust to summarise what I will have now:\r\n\r\nI will show you running examples where we can see that we can see with every commit that the build from scratch still works (:latest-clean), where the (:latest) build is usually incremental for the benefit of the downloading users. \r\n\r\nThe latest will be periodically refreshed from scratch whenever any of the events happens:\r\n\r\n- base image is updated (with --pull flag of the build) - whole build is rerun\r\n- setup.py changes (pip install is run from the scratch) \r\n- we decide to force rebuild it from the scratch by incrementing the variable in Dockerfile \r\n- I will show an example where `apt-get upgrade` makes perfect sense.  In one of the latest builds I made there were two security fixes and a timezone fix applied thanks to running `apt-get upgrade` - it took like 4 minutes to build and likely few MB more to download the latest layer in order to get the latest security fixes in the latest build.\r\n\r\nI hope that might be a good solution that addresses all your concerns and my concern about full downloads with every commit by the users. And again - I can add it as experimental for the time being, but I think it's worth to merge it to see how it behaves with real usage.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/455998180/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/455999297","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4543#issuecomment-455999297","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4543","id":455999297,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NTk5OTI5Nw==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-21T09:11:14Z","updated_at":"2019-01-21T10:48:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@ashb, @Fokko - I am more than happy to help with solving the dependency issues as well. I hope to have more time to work on it soon (than when I had couple of months back). I just am not sure that this is the same issue but this one can help with the dependency one. I think if we finally agree that layered approach is workable, it might open up some new ways of dealing with dependencies and solving dependencies issue might actually get solved more easily. And likely - we won't have to do much if we move to layered approach for CI images as well.\r\n\r\nWhat we get with the layered solution is a kind of \"temporary stability\" of image. Unless setup.py or base image changes, the dependencies in base image will remain pretty stable. We could use very similar approach in CI Docker images: move it to the airflow repository, and skip \"pip install' after every commit. I think that might solve most of concerns I had about stability of CI builds (and why I originated the thread). Most of the builds in CI will be \"stable\" - they will use cached dependencies from the last successfull build of the CI image. \r\n\r\nIt's only when someone upgrades setup.py where the transient dependencies might cause installation problems (and it's the right moment to solve them). At the same time we will always get early warnings about dependency problems with the \"latest-clean\" image that will be run with every commit - and this will happen without disturbing the work of people running their builds using the latest working CI image.  \r\n\r\nThe good thing will be that the tests will continue to run for the users that will make simple commits - using the cached dependencies even if \"latest-clean\" image will fail with transient dependencies problems. Until the \"clean\" build is fixed test will continue to run using the latest cached dependencies. It's great for the regular committers (because their work won't be disturbed by external factors they can do nothing about). On the other hands, solving dependency issues will be at the hands of those who already deal with setup.py changes in their own changes. \r\n\r\nThis looks like frictionless, self-healing setup that might provide both stability for committers and \"eventual consistency\" for maintainers and we will not have to change the approach where we have \"upper-open\" requirements in airflow.\r\n\r\nLast but not least (but this is quite independent) - we could think about freezing the requirements in the scripts that you use to prepare the release. But I think this is quite a different task.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/455999297/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/456007601","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4564#issuecomment-456007601","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4564","id":456007601,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NjAwNzYwMQ==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-21T09:37:59Z","updated_at":"2019-01-21T09:37:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#

Those are three different builds in Docker Hub and they are build automatically on push, I hope you do not need any permissions to see it - if you won't see it, I can copy the logs elsewhere:\r\n\r\n1) \"latest\" build using previously cached layers:\r\nhttps://cloud.docker.com/repository/registry-1.docker.io/potiuk/airflow/builds/c68a9564-f40a-492f-8cb3-d7126af73e12\r\n\r\nIt was built using previous \"latest\" as cache. You can see that only sources of airflow changed, no setup.py related files changed. Since last \"clean\" build there were 3 packages released in ubuntu: They are automatically upgraded with `apt-get upgrade`. Those are security fixes + timezone change:\r\n\r\n> The following packages will be upgraded:\r\n> libsystemd0 libudev1 tzdata\r\n> 3 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.\r\n> Need to get 679 kB of archives.\r\n> After this operation, 14.3 kB of additional disk space will be used.\r\n\r\nAfter that `pip install -e` was run again and all the requirements were \"already satisified\". It took 5 minutes to run the build, it is incremental difference vs. previous one -  less than < 1MB to download by anyone who already downloaded previous \"latest\" image. \r\n \r\n2) Then (result of the same push) we have \"latest-clean\" build - rebuilt from scratch: https://cloud.docker.com/repository/registry-1.docker.io/potiuk/airflow/builds/b8e1ac70-a8fa-49a3-93ad-d27a43670e1c. --no-cache directive was used to build that one (based on the latest-clean image tag). It took 30 minutes to build. This is equivalent to the current build from master. It's almost 1GB to download for anyone who wants to get this version and already downloaded previous \"latest-clean\" - and that's how it should be.\r\n\r\n3) Then we have \"release build\" - I pushed an artificial tag 1.10.99999 which resulted in \r\n `release-1.10.9999` image. It is built from the scratch as well based on \"release-.*\" regexp matching the tag: https://cloud.docker.com/repository/registry-1.docker.io/potiuk/airflow/builds/12ede2d4-235d-4e1e-a127-7349bb94abce . This one is only built if you push a tag following the regexp \"^[0-9].+\".\r\n\r\nHere is the screenshot of the DockerHub config I use (in apache repo the source should eventually be \"master\"  rather than \"multi-layered-dockerfile\" as is in my POC):\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1077\" alt=\"screenshot 2019-01-20 at 23 34 20\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/595491/51445999-0871ce80-1d0c-11e9-9493-86c0ac53c68f.png\">","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/456029101/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/456034644","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4460#issuecomment-456034644","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4460","id":456034644,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NjAzNDY0NA==","user":{"login":"alikemalocalan","id":3500876,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MDA4NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3500876?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alikemalocalan","html_url":"https://github.com/alikemalocalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alikemalocalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alikemalocalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alikemalocalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alikemalocalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alikemalocalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alikemalocalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alikemalocalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alikemalocalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alikemalocalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-21T11:02:55Z","updated_at":"2019-01-21T11:02:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Yes, i added ```docs/integration.rst``` and it's works well.
