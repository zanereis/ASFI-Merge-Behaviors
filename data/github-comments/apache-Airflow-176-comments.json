I tested this PR and it works fine and fixes the issue.\r\n\r\nA minor issue I have is \"it says 16-17 dags in DAGBAG\" when `load_examples = True` and there are no dags in DAGS folder. It says that because of the example DAGs but might be confusing for users. However, I don't have a major issue with that.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/441300173/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/441311757","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4228#issuecomment-441311757","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4228","id":441311757,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MTMxMTc1Nw==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-23T20:07:32Z","updated_at":"2018-11-23T20:07:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/4228?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#4228](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/4228?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/commit/5955db1c765aae1cd187abe7401294bd72493521?src=pr&el=desc) will **increase** coverage by `<.01%`.\n> The diff coverage is `100%`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/4228/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=WdLKlKHOAU&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/4228?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@            Coverage Diff            @@\n##           master   #4228      +/-   ##\n=========================================\n+ Coverage   77.79%   77.8%   +<.01%     \n=========================================\n  Files         201     201              \n  Lines       16360   16360              \n=========================================\n+ Hits        12728   12729       +1     \n+ Misses       3632    3631       -1\n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/4228?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [airflow/operators/dagrun\\_operator.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/4228/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9vcGVyYXRvcnMvZGFncnVuX29wZXJhdG9yLnB5) | `96.15% <100%> (ø)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [airflow/models.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/4228/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9tb2RlbHMucHk=) | `92.33% <0%> (+0.04%)` | :arrow_up: |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/4228?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/4228?src=pr&el=footer).

Would you be interested in adding pluggable secret encryption and/or storage for Airflow 2.0? I'd be happy to contribute.\r\n* I think it should be possible to rotate the Fernet key without updating all credentials. Ideally users can easily automate updating all credentials, but that might not be possible--for example, users might add credentials to Airflow manually, credentials might need to be pulled from many sources, etc. And in general, it's good practice to make it possible to easily rotate any cryptographic keys.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I also submitted #4232, which should make it easier to programmatically update credentials.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/441666665/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/441670842","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4121#issuecomment-441670842","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4121","id":441670842,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MTY3MDg0Mg==","user":{"login":"omusavi","id":8106112,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDYxMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8106112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/omusavi","html_url":"https://github.com/omusavi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omusavi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omusavi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omusavi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omusavi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omusavi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omusavi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omusavi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omusavi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omusavi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-26T15:06:12Z","updated_at":"2018-11-26T15:06:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Noticed there were some merge conflicts in integration.rst since last week so I fixed that and pushed again","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/441670842/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/441673433","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4236#issuecomment-441673433","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4236","id":441673433,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MTY3MzQzMw==","user":{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-26T15:13:25Z","updated_at":"2018-11-26T15:13:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Swagger is now rebranded and re-badged as OpenAPI (Sometimes also called Swagger v3) so it would be nice to find a module supporting that:\r\n\r\nhttps://smartbear.com/blog/develop/what-is-the-difference-between-swagger-and-openapi/","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/441673433/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
