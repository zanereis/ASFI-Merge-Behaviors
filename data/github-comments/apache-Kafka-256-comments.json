More specifically, for windowed rocksdb store since we always store the window start timestamp as prefix of the key, which is 64bits, hence first 10bits bloom filter would not help much on filtering those keys; for such cases it is better to have the prefix seeking support as discussed here:\r\n\r\nhttps://confluentinc.atlassian.net/wiki/display/Engineering/Discussion%3A+Non-key+KTable-KTable+Joins#Discussion:Non-keyKTable-KTableJoins-Option1:useRocksDBprefixseeking\r\n\r\nThe code itself LGTM, but I think it is better to execute a benchmark with the following settings before merging the PR:\r\n\r\n1. have a running aggregate in Streams with RocksDBStore (i.e. not windowed store).\r\n2. have another thread continuously query the rocksDB store on single key lookup. \r\n3. compare the query QPS with / wo this PR; expect to have non-neglectible perf

@mjsax!\r\n\r\nI appreciate that you jumped on looking at this issue, and I think you've addressed the specific example I wrote up in KAFKA-5315, but I think there's still a window where the same problem might manifest slightly differently.  I may very well be mistaken, so please take this with a grain of salt; I'm making some assumption leaps on how initializing state stores works.\r\n\r\nA small tweak on this problem would be if the source topic contained `Key0:Record0` followed by `Key0:Record1`, where both `Record0` and `Record1` produce the same group-by key.  If an exception occurred while processing `Key0:Record1`, `Record1` could be stored in the persistent state store.  If processing restarted later, and the state store initialization did not re-set Key0 to `Record0` (eg. it replayed the topic from the checkpoint file, and `Key0:Record0` was an earlier offset), then a `Change(Key0:Record1<-Key0:Record1)` will be emitted from the KTable source.  This would cause the repartition map to send a `Change(null<-Key0:Record1)` then `Change(Key0:Record1<-null)` to the aggregate, which would effectively cause the same incorrect aggregate output regardless of this patch.\r\n\r\nA similar mistake could occur if the source topic contained `Key0:Record0` followed by `Key0:null`, and an exception occurs while processing `Key0:null`.  If `Key0` is deleted from the store, not re-set by initiasing state stores, and then `Key0:null` is processed, the repartition map would emit no records because the oldValue & newValue are both null, and the aggregate output value would remain despite the delete.\r\n\r\nThe window for these cases are smaller: the \"corrupt\" state store record needs to not be restored by initialising the state store, but this seems plausible.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/303717039/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/303718911","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/3137#issuecomment-303718911","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/3137","id":303718911,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMzcxODkxMQ==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-24T13:10:54Z","updated_at":"2017-05-24T13:10:54Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer
