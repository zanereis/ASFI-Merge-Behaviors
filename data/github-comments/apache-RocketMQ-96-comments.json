& panzhi33, 非常感谢两位的解答\r\n\r\n我同意您的说法：”对于同步复制来说，SLAVE_NOT_AVALIABLE 被定义为消息发布失败“，这点可以通过消息追踪确认（对于sendStatus 为 SLAVE_NOT_AVALIABLE 的消息，消息追踪中标识为 status: failed。\r\n\r\n但是我依然有疑问为什么 RocketMQ 对于 status: failed (sendStatus: SLAVE_NOT_AVALIABLE) 的不同消息，处理方法不一致？\r\n\r\n我测试了：普通消息（同步发送，异步发送），顺序消息，定时消息，这些消息在 status: failed (sendStatus: SLAVE_NOT_AVALIABLE) 时，都可以被正常消费。 也就是说当生产者收到 status: failed (sendStatus: SLAVE_NOT_AVALIABLE) 并不需要做任何特殊处理，消息依然可以成功消费。\r\n\r\n而对事物消息，当 status: failed (sendStatus: SLAVE_NOT_AVALIABLE)发生 时，消息因为被强制Rollback，导致无法从 RMQ_SYS_TRANS_HALF_TOPIC 复制到指定的 Topic 中，所以无法被正常消费。\r\n\r\n所以我依然存在以下2个问题：\r\n\r\n1. 如果如您所说：”当消费者收到 status: failed (sendStatus: SLAVE_NOT_AVALIABLE) 时，应该自行处理“；那么岂不是要消费者收到 sendStatus: SLAVE_NOT_AVALIABLE时，在针对发送消息的类型（判断是否时事物消息）使用不一样的处理方式？为什么要设计这种不一致的处理方式？（对于不同消息类型，处理方式不一致）\r\n\r\n2. 当收到 status: failed (sendStatus: SLAVE_NOT_AVALIABLE) 时，消费者应该做什么样的处理呢？\r\n我测试了重发消息，结果在 2M-2S 的集群中，当其中1个Slave节点宕机时，消费者重发消息，并不能确保将消息发送到完整的M-S中，而依然会依照负载均衡策略，轮询发送（即有可能多次都发送到Slave宕机的M-S中）。\r\n\r\n谢谢","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1050915161/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1051461590","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/3893#issuecomment-1051461590","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/3893","id":1051461590,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl84-rAfW","user":{"login":"lifepuzzlefun","id":13600283,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjAwMjgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13600283?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lifepuzzlefun","html_url":"https://github.com/lifepuzzlefun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lifepuzzlefun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lifepuzzlefun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lifepuzzlefun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lifepuzzlefun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lifepuzzlefun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lifepuzzlefun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lifepuzzlefun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lifepuzzlefun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lifepuzzlefun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-26T02:11:52Z","updated_at":"2022-02-26T02:11:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@RongtongJin
