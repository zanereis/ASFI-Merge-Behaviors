I'm not sure about that. Do you mean omitting the \"FROM\" syntax ?  But it will be hard to validate SQL syntax. Because the query can follow a WHERE clause or JOIN/UNION with other tables.  For example, it's wired and hard to validate the query like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmytable.sql(\"SELECT * WHERE a > 13 UNION SELECT * FROM TABLE_B\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think allowing query on other tables is fine here.

@rmetzger, I've addressed your review comments. I still have some problems however, on the following:\r\n\r\n1. I can't really reproduce the problem with the conflicts in `META-INF/services` dependencies, hence couldn't really try out whether that actually works correctly or if would actually use the `ServiceResourceTransformer` instead of `AppenderTransformer`. From the Maven documentation and what I understand from what the original ES2 documentation was trying to address, I think we can use the `ServiceResourceTransformer`. What do you think?\r\n\r\n2. Regarding Log4j 2 dependency: That is required for the ES 5 Java client to log correctly, since the ES 5 Java API now uses Log4j 2 and does not detect logging implementations, and must have a Log4j 2 API in the classpath.\r\n\r\nI am still figuring out how to get the internal ES Java client in the ES 5 connector to log to TaskManager logs when using cluster execution, though (the connector log and Flink log is correctly logged, only the ES Java client log is missing).\r\n\r\nI've included this `log4j2.properties` in a test project to be packaged for execution:\r\n```\r\nappender.file.type=File\r\nappender.file.filename=${log.file}\r\nappender.file.name=file\r\nappender.file.layout.type=PatternLayout\r\nappender.file.layout.pattern=%-4r [%t] %-5p %c %x - %m%n\r\n\r\nrootLogger.level=info\r\nrootLogger.appenderRef.file.ref=file\r\n```\r\n\r\nSomehow, it isn't picking the `log.file` property, which is set by the `flink-daemon.sh` script as a system property. Changing `log.file` to another specific file path works.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/272802618/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/272806636","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3068#issuecomment-272806636","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3068","id":272806636,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MjgwNjYzNg==","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-16T09:03:12Z","updated_at":"2017-01-16T09:03:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"merging.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/272806636/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/272809194","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3106#issuecomment-272809194","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3106","id":272809194,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MjgwOTE5NA==","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-16T09:16:07Z","updated_at":"2017-01-16T09:16:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The code checks for null since there is no *technical* contract that the returned value is never null.

The TaskIOMetricGroup could type its counters to \"SimpleCounter\" as well. Since that class it not final, and future mocks/checks can be implemented on that class as well\r\n  - We can make sure that the field `counter` is always initialized by initially assigning a standalone SimpleCounter.

Can you add a `testCloseWithoutOpen()` method to `org.apache.flink.api.java.hadoop.mapred.HadoopInputFormatTest` and `org.apache.flink.api.java.hadoop.mapreduce.HadoopInputFormatTest` to guard this fix?\r\n\r\nOccasionally builds fail due to timeouts. That's nothing to worry about. I'll run the tests again before merging.\r\n\r\nThank you.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/273107579/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/273107682","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3058#issuecomment-273107682","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3058","id":273107682,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MzEwNzY4Mg==","user":{"login":"twalthr","id":5746567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDY1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5746567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr","html_url":"https://github.com/twalthr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-17T10:58:57Z","updated_at":"2017-01-17T10:58:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I have no objections.
