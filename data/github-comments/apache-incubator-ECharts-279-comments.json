Because the polar component in the echarts 3 is reconstructed to be the standard polar coordinate component, this component is renamed to be radar to avoid confusion.\r\n\r\nSummary: radar coordinate is different from polar coordinate in Echarts 3\r\n\r\n> Radar chart coordinate is different from polar coordinate, in that every axis indicator of the radar chart coordinate is an individual dimension. \r\n\r\nSummary: radar coordinate is very special.\r\n\r\n> How to display axisPointer:\r\nIn cartesian (grid) and polar](~polar) and (single axis, each axis has its own axisPointer.\r\n\r\nSummary: As a special coordinator, radar does not exist in axisPointer's implements list.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis seems to be a new feature waiting for implement.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/608339356/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/608340041","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/7864#issuecomment-608340041","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/7864","id":608340041,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwODM0MDA0MQ==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-03T09:43:33Z","updated_at":"2020-04-03T09:43:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity.

这个layout 跟viewport 有很大关系，比如我第一次layout完后，存了数据，然后把浏览器窗口大小改变一下，再load 进去，graph 的比例就不一样了，像是被压扁了一样。\r\n\r\n2. 另外一个办法我想到的就是用convertToPixel 存当前canvas 大小及像素点，然后重新load 的时候根据新的屏幕大小，调整像素位置，然后在convertFromPixel 写成layout。可以第一步就不对，我用下面的方法返回的跟送进去的一样：\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nvar obj = chart.convertToPixel({seriesIndex:0},[958.004150390625,
