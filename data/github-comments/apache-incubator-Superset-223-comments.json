@vnourdin!\r\n\r\nOn the Superset side, I tried to make this as agnostic as possible. The example config is meant for Airflow, but by changing the config you can add any metadata you need to successfully schedule a query.\r\n\r\nAt Lyft we're prototyping this with Hive, and later we'll add support to Presto. We're also planning to add an option to upload the data to our Druid database. My co-worker @argentfalcon wrote the Airflow pipeline, and I'll see if he can share it with you. \r\n\r\nFor our proof-of-concept we expect from the user a query filtered  by `ds` and a table name. The table will be created if it not exists, partitioned by `ds`. Everyday we run the query and insert the results into the corresponding partition, incrementally building the results. For now, this is the only supported workflow.\r\n\r\nWe also support (or will support) depending on a daily partition of a Hive table or on another Airflow DAG. The way we do that is by adding dependencies (see the modal) like `hive://schema.table` or `airflow://dag_id`.\r\n\r\nIt should be easy to support different workflows. You could add a checkbox asking the user if this is a full or incremental query, for example, and the Airflow DAG would work differently depending on the value.\r\n\r\nHope this helps!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/490573647/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/490575995","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/7476#issuecomment-490575995","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/7476","id":490575995,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MDU3NTk5NQ==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-08T17:25:20Z","updated_at":"2019-05-08T17:25:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7476?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#7476](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7476?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/commit/6b8bda609676364436941a491c6cd91a7e6032b9?src=pr&el=desc) will **not change** coverage.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7476/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=KsB0fHcx6l&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7476?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@           Coverage Diff           @@\n##           master    #7476   +/-   ##\n=======================================\n  Coverage   65.42%   65.42%           \n=======================================\n  Files         435      435           \n  Lines       21322    21322           \n  Branches     2347     2347           \n=======================================\n  Hits        13950    13950           \n  Misses       7256     7256           \n  Partials      116      116\n```\n\n\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7476?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7476?src=pr&el=footer).
