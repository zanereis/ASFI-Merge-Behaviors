If so, we should enable it to avoid regression.\r\n\r\nGitHub Actions does not provide Linux ARM64 VMs at the moment (https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/issues/2536).\r\nBut there are few ways to do it:\r\n* self-hosted runner - There are security concerns with it!  GHA does not recommend using self-hosted runners for public repositories. Apache AirFlow uses custom GHA runner with better security. If you go this way then using [Oracle Cloud ARM64](https://blogs.oracle.com/cloud-infrastructure/post/announcing-github-actions-arm-runners-for-the-arm-compute-platform-on-oracle-cloud-infrastructure) for the runner is very easy! \r\n* Remote Kubernetes - I have blogged about it [here](https://martin-grigorov.medium.com/githubactions-build-and-test-on-huaweicloud-arm64-af9d5c97b766). The issue here is that the setup becomes a bit more complex\r\n\r\nOther projects use TravisCI or CircleCI (my recommendation) for testing on Linux ARM64/PPC64/s390x. The issue is - one more CI to maintain and watch over.\r\nYet another option is to use Apache Jenkins or Buildbot.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/927017014/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/927108083","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/4227#issuecomment-927108083","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/4227","id":927108083,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAfU5DM43Qovz","user":{"login":"zjffdu","id":164491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu","html_url":"https://github.com/zjffdu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-25T11:33:01Z","updated_at":"2021-09-25T11:33:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Will merge if no more comment","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/927108083/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/927166840","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/4192#issuecomment-927166840","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/4192","id":927166840,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAfU5DM43Q3F4","user":{"login":"ebuildy","id":1219817,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTk4MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1219817?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebuildy","html_url":"https://github.com/ebuildy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebuildy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebuildy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebuildy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebuildy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebuildy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebuildy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebuildy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebuildy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebuildy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-25T18:48:00Z","updated_at":"2021-09-25T18:48:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"sorry for the big late, I will do it this week!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/927166840/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/927229606","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/4233#issuecomment-927229606","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/4233","id":927229606,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAfU5DM43RGam","user":{"login":"zjffdu","id":164491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu","html_url":"https://github.com/zjffdu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-26T04:34:48Z","updated_at":"2021-09-26T04:35:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @martin-g for the investigation, I checked CircleCI.
