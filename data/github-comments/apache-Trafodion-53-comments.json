, @DaveBirdsall , I leave the original checking below my change since as I googled, the definition of LLONG_MIN is 'undefined', different platform/libc and C and C++ compilers all may have different definition. But there are two basic choices:\nLLONG_MIN as -9223372036854775808\nor\nLLONG_MIN as -9223372036854775807\n\nSo I was hoping in a system which defines the LLONG_MIN as 0x800000000000L or (-LLONG_MAX - 1 ) the first check that I modified will take effect and make sure -9223372036854775808 will be regarded as a valid number: \n\nFor some older platform/compiler, the LLONG_MIN will be defined as -LLONG_MAX.  In this case, -9223372036854775808 should be regarded as invalid. The second check at line 2113 should take effect.\n\nBut I agree with you, line 2113 seems dangerous, and may not work as expected, but we cannot test it without using different platform/compiler/libc to figure out. And I think supporting older platform is not something valuable. Most mainstream systems use first LLONG_MIN definition (C++ 11 and later will use first def as well). So we are good to remove line 2113. I will remove those code and add comments to link to this RP discussion.\n\nI refer to

opposed to adding the current proposal to Trafodion, here are my reasons:\n- Right now there is not a 1:1 relationship between a UDR object and an invocation of a TMUDF. Therefore we cannot store data that is related to an invocation in the UDR object. It would be good to have a discussion on this design question.\n- The emitRow method doesn't have access to the result columns, and it is not possible to handle things like passthrough columns. This method should have an \"info\" and a \"plan\" parameter, also maybe a way to pass only some of the result columns.\n- We should try to support multiple input tables in new code we are adding.\n- The proposed interface works only for mappers, not for reducers (it does not detect partition boundaries). Also note that I would like to add a new interface that makes writing reducers easier, by having a method to read the next row within a partition. See [TRAFODION-1129](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TRAFODION-1129).\n- I'm sure other people will have different views on what a more convenient TMUDF interface will look like. Should we allow them to add their favorite interface as well? How many interfaces should we allow? For that reason I have a preference to keeping a single interface.\n\nAgain, adding it to the [code examples](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/TRAFODION/Trafodion+Code+Examples) would be very good and useful. I could also imagine adding the emitRow method that is proposed here to the Trafodion interface, after comments are addressed.\n\n@sureshsubbiah, I'm wondering what you think.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/248043916/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/248095567","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/646#issuecomment-248095567","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/646","id":248095567,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0ODA5NTU2Nw==","user":{"login":"prashanth-vasudev","id":13125150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTI1MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13125150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashanth-vasudev","html_url":"https://github.com/prashanth-vasudev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashanth-vasudev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashanth-vasudev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashanth-vasudev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashanth-vasudev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashanth-vasudev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashanth-vasudev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashanth-vasudev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashanth-vasudev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashanth-vasudev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-19T19:22:59Z","updated_at":"2016-09-19T19:22:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"

you @mashengchen for this code. I do not fully understand the need for this interface and exactly how it will be used. Do you think it will be better if file a JIRA explaining the purpose and providing examples (with a SQL query, and all java listings and example output).\n\nI do get that the motivation for SimpleUDR is to provide a less complex interface when a TMUDF writer wants to acheive simpler tasks. But how this new interface does that, without sacrificing performance is not clear to me. In addition there are the issue @zellerh raised about having a unified interface and having some of the original principles in mind when new extensions are proposed.\n\nIn summary as @zeller suggested I see two alternatives\n1) We add this change to code examples, to be used by those already comfortable with it\n2) OR, we file a JIRA with the objective behind this change and then discuss this further there.\n\nIn the current interface other than processData all methods are optional, so I don't quite get how simplicity can be achieved. Maybe the goal is not simplicity after all, but an alternate JDBC type interface with prepare/execute/close?  \n\nPlease don't take these comments to indicate a lack of interest in this change.  However, as it stands it is likely not ready for mainline. New interfaces for TMUDF (and new uses for the existing interfaces) are always fascinating. @DaveBirdsall had suggested recently how it would be nice to support Java UDFs that are part of other Apache projects like HiveMall. So this an exciting and wide ranging area. Hope we can discuss this some more.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/248181849/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/248185158","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/702#issuecomment-248185158","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/702","id":248185158,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0ODE4NTE1OA==","user":{"login":"mashengchen","id":3610829,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTA4Mjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3610829?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mashengchen","html_url":"https://github.com/mashengchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mashengchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mashengchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mashengchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mashengchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mashengchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mashengchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mashengchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mashengchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mashengchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-20T02:30:48Z","updated_at":"2016-09-20T02:30:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@zellerh about your point 1,is that means it’s thread-unsafe in UDR?

in phase 2, the default will be turned on. It is discussed as part of jira 2234\n\nattribute could be specified explicitly during ddl or based the default value of the cqd.\nOnce specified, it becomes part of table attribute irrespective of what the default value\nis when the table is used or showddl is issued.\n\nCurrently, showddl shows aligned attribute explicitly and nothing for hbase attribute.\nSo if nothing is displayed, then the table has hbase attr.\n\nWhat we can do is to show explicit attribute for both hbase and aligned format.\nThis will be similar to how serialization property of a column is explicitly displayed\nirrespective of how it was declared (explicitly or through a cqd default value).\nThat way if showddl will correctly represent how a table was originally created.\n\nWe can make that change for phase
