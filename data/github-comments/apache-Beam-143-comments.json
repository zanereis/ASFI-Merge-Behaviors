I'll need a few days to go over this. To minimize review rounds, can you do an extra pass yourself and make sure it conforms to PTransform Style Guide (e.g. I noticed some code that was handling data loss by logging a message, which is forbidden by the style guide - there might be more stuff); also stuff like typos and Javadoc comment rendering?\r\n\r\nAnother thing that would help speed up review and make progress incrementally (I'm particularly concerned that when large PRs like this get a lot of comments, the Github UI becomes unmanageable): consider splitting into separate commits or even PRs: it seems like read part, write part and integration tests for them can all be in separate commits at least.\r\n\r\nAs for several PRs, that raises a concern where the code may be in a committed intermediate state without ITs (i.e. most likely broken), but I think that can be addressed by iterating on the review via PRs on *your* branch. I.e. make them separate PRs from your redis-io branch to your master branch, and still specify me as reviewer. When we get everything in good shape on your branch, then make one big PR to merge this into beam (which might still have some comments, but not as many).\r\n\r\nLet me know if this suggested review process makes sense. It's the first time we'd be doing something like this, but I think it may make things easier compared to how we handled previous PRs of similar size. We can use this PR as a training ground to hash out the process.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/286625766/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/286625927","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/2241#issuecomment-286625927","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/2241","id":286625927,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NjYyNTkyNw==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-15T02:52:28Z","updated_at":"2017-03-15T02:52:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\n[![Coverage
