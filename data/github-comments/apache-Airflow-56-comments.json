I also noticed that zope is not mentioned anywhere in `setup.py`\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/226900672/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/226905430","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1607#issuecomment-226905430","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1607","id":226905430,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNjkwNTQzMA==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-17T23:38:39Z","updated_at":"2016-06-21T18:44:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## [Current coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/1607?src=pr) is **64.07%**\n\n> Merging [#1607](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/1607?src=pr) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/branch/master?src=pr) will decrease coverage by **0.10%**\n\n``` diff\n@@             master      #1607   diff @@\n==========================================\n  Files           120        121     +1   \n  Lines          8443       8462    +19   \n  Methods           0          0          \n  Messages          0          0          \n  Branches          0          0          \n==========================================\n+ Hits           5419       5422     +3   \n- Misses         3024       3040    +16   \n  Partials          0          0          \n```\n\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io?src=pr).

That's because we make no assumptions about how the execution is implemented, or on what machine/environment, or even when it will be run. Passing a task object to the `execute_async()` method is contrary to that assumption. In particular, there is no guarantee that task objects are serializable.\n\nThe `key` should give enough information to load the task inside the executor by querying the database for the matching taskinstance -- I think that would be the far preferable way to implement the desired behavior in a custom executor.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/227200460/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/227206833","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1594#issuecomment-227206833","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1594","id":227206833,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNzIwNjgzMw==","user":{"login":"paulbramsen","id":4658911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NTg5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4658911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulbramsen","html_url":"https://github.com/paulbramsen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulbramsen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulbramsen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulbramsen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulbramsen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulbramsen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulbramsen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulbramsen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulbramsen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulbramsen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-20T17:12:49Z","updated_at":"2016-06-20T17:12:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Moved

@dud225 thanks! The sla stuff is indeed in need of some code love :). I really would like to see some unittests for this as it is close to the core of the scheduler and this is the area where everyone gets a bit nervous when changes are happening. \n\nNext to to that, a bit more fundamental, relying on tasks here is probably not the best way forward. We are processing per dag and your approach would consider all tasks first, this can lead to operational issues like waiting for locks etc. In your approach manage_slas is called for every DAG but will scan all tasks for every dag. If that is the way to go (I doubt it) manage_slas would need to be factored out of do_dags to one level up.\n\nSmall nit: please correct your commit message (mechanism)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/227219934/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/227278694","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1607#issuecomment-227278694","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1607","id":227278694,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNzI3ODY5NA==","user":{"login":"aoen","id":1592778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTI3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1592778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoen","html_url":"https://github.com/aoen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-20T21:42:28Z","updated_at":"2016-06-20T21:42:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM once landscape check is green.
