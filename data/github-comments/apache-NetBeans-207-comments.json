However, forcing the load breaks because `libs.nbjavacapi` cannot be loaded due to the fragment host already being enabled.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, the `Options / Java / Ant` panel causes ergonomics to enable the `extide` cluster, but also a few modules from the `java` cluster including `java.source.base`.  This triggers `libs.javacapi` to load without `libs.nbjavacapi`.  Attempting to open the Maven tab in the Java cluster then fails because `libs.nbjavacapi` cannot be loaded.\r\n\r\nSimplest fix seems to be to add back `OpenIDE-Module-Recommends: org.netbeans.libs.nbjavac` into `java.source.base`.  That might negate the purpose of #6743.  cc/ @jlahoda @lahodaj ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2077554343/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2077564480","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/6743#issuecomment-2077564480","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/6743","id":2077564480,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M571R5A","user":{"login":"neilcsmith-net","id":3975960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3975960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net","html_url":"https://github.com/neilcsmith-net","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-25T15:21:56Z","updated_at":"2024-04-25T15:21:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@lahodaj I think this is the cause of a regression that causes a lockup in ergonomics.

If this was a common issue, then with the hundreds of thousands of people who download each Windows installer per release, I think it would have cropped up before.\r\n\r\nIf you continue to have issues with the legacy NBI installer, you could also try the community Windows installer from https://netbeans.apache.org/front/main/download/nb21/#_community_installers which include a bundled JDK and are built with NBPackage.  At some point hopefully we'll be able to move off NBI to NBPackage for the ASF Windows installer as we have with other OS - some changes still to be made there.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2090436739/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2090510082","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/7192#issuecomment-2090510082","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7192","id":2090510082,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M58mqcC","user":{"login":"mvorisek","id":2228672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjg2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2228672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvorisek","html_url":"https://github.com/mvorisek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvorisek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvorisek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvorisek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvorisek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvorisek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvorisek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvorisek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvorisek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvorisek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-02T13:31:29Z","updated_at":"2024-05-02T13:31:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@junichi11 were you able to reproduce it?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2090510082/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2090730648","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/7268#issuecomment-2090730648","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7268","id":2090730648,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M58ngSY","user":{"login":"neilcsmith-net","id":3975960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3975960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net","html_url":"https://github.com/neilcsmith-net","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-02T14:55:08Z","updated_at":"2024-05-02T14:55:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Please try and catch if a library JAR update includes new native macOS binaries, and add a comment to the PR.
