After that, SQL parse and rewrite phase will be skipped and the overall enforcement efficiency can be enhanced.\r\nI think  that in version 4.0.0 ,the setDatabaseShardingValue can only sikp the sql

congrats to everyone, we basically finish the parser opimization for MySQL! 🥇 \r\n\r\nThe parser opimization for other databases is our next step and then we will consider transferring our sharding parser from old one to the one we are working, which seems a great challenge for us, go ahead! ✊ \r\n\r\n@terrymanu @SteNicholas @dongzl @tianbin1001 @beijing-penguin
