I see no reason why this could not be done, but I don't believe any of the other views have a corresponding refresh capability built in at the moment, so this would need to be created as part of this.\r\n1. Again, I see no reason not to do this.

This PR tries to address a larger infrastructure outage that can last several hours.\r\n\r\nA user may have a legitimate case for only retrying 3 times (say a particular service is flaky at really high load).  Having shorter retries for transient errors ensures enough robustness for flaky services but not high enough that they completely mask unreliable services.\r\n\r\nThe solution I'm proposing tries to be more intelligent by applying business logic to the particular hook.\r\nIf it's indeed a transient-error, then retry according to the existing Airflow logic, but if it's a complete infrastructure outage, then perhaps retry for 2-4 hours. Luckily, services like Hive, Presto, Spark, etc., can provide enough context to make this determination.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/422210823/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/422226766","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3903#issuecomment-422226766","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3903","id":422226766,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMjIyNjc2Ng==","user":{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-18T01:51:35Z","updated_at":"2018-09-18T01:51:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi @feng-tao , yes, my concern was that if `npm install` operation would \"overwrite\" our updates in `bootstrap-theme.css`.
