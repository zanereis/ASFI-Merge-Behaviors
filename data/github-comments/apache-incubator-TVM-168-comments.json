IMHO, I don't think we need to test this functionality in the partitioning pass as it is a unit test of layout itself. Instead, You can directly make the \"partitioned\" graph and run Alterlayout pass and assert whatever IR it should emit.\r\n\r\nHi Zhi, I don't think it is possible to create the partitioned graph without actually using partitoning. I recreated the subgraph below:\r\n```\r\ninput_type = relay.TensorType((1, 5, 6, 6), \"float32\")\r\nx = relay.var(\"x\", relay.TupleType([input_type, input_type]))\r\nout = relay.concatenate(x, axis=1)\r\nfunc = relay.Function([x], out)\r\n```\r\nHowever, the `relay.concatenate` python API does not accept a Var node as the input:\r\n```\r\n  File \"test_pass_alter_op_layout.py\", line 1053, in test_concatenate\r\n    out = relay.concatenate(x, axis=1)\r\n\r\n  File \"/data/neo-ai-tvm/python/tvm/relay/op/tensor.py\", line 888, in concatenate\r\n    data = list(data)\r\n\r\nTypeError: 'Var' object is not iterable\r\n```\r\n\r\nEdit: I was able to bypass this by calling `tvm.relay.op._make.concatenate`.

The reason is the legacy bit-shift operator overflow issue. As the second parameter was higher than 32(bit length of int32), the values produced by tvm operator becomes undefined. However i found numpy behavior is quite stable in this scenario. My personal opinion is to make the behavior inline with numpy. \r\n\r\nCurrently in test case i have restricted the second parameter for left_shift and right_shift operator to be in range : [1, 31].\r\nPlease review and provide your valuable feedback.
