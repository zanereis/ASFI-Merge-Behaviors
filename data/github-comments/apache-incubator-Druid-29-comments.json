system.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/129004716/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/129006481","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/1606#issuecomment-129006481","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1606","id":129006481,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyOTAwNjQ4MQ==","user":{"login":"zengzhihai110","id":3145769,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNDU3Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3145769?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zengzhihai110","html_url":"https://github.com/zengzhihai110","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zengzhihai110/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zengzhihai110/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zengzhihai110/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zengzhihai110/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zengzhihai110/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zengzhihai110/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zengzhihai110/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zengzhihai110/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zengzhihai110/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-08T16:39:26Z","updated_at":"2015-08-08T16:39:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"ok

I have noticed many problems with hadoop classloader being different. As a workaround, instead of adding hdfs-storage as extension in the configuration, can you try to include the druid-hdfs-storage and all the hadoop configuration, dependencies (that can be obtained by running command `hadoop classpath` on a machine where hadoop has been setup) in the classpath. And, provide necessary HDFS settings as described in Deep Storage ( http://druid.io/docs/latest/dependencies/deep-storage.html )  . Then auth should work without any of the code changes.\n\n2) regarding the problem with auth expiration, can you try to specify following environment variables to the druid java process..

Also, it confuses users and we see email threads about explaining the differences between 2 kind of hadoop ingestion.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/131205167/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/131205405","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1374#issuecomment-131205405","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1374","id":131205405,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMTIwNTQwNQ==","user":{"login":"drcrallen","id":8213081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMTMwODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8213081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen","html_url":"https://github.com/drcrallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-14T18:37:59Z","updated_at":"2015-08-14T18:37:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@himanshug / @gianm Cool, I'm good with maintaining existing behavior, and just wanted to make sure our expectations are documented in case anyone ever comes back to this PR's comment thread.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/131205405/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/131265993","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/1621#issuecomment-131265993","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1621","id":131265993,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMTI2NTk5Mw==","user":{"login":"himanshug","id":246308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjMwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug","html_url":"https://github.com/himanshug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-14T23:19:15Z","updated_at":"2015-08-14T23:19:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@xvrl I am wondering if we can disable java-8 build as well.

think  this is  a bug,But this PR isn't good solution.\nThe reason why this query of output is empty: inner query group by 'cast'  and 'device' two dimensions, and  outer query only group by 'device',meanwhile filter 'cast' dimension.\nas following code\n\n``` java\n // We need the inner incremental index to have all the columns required by the outer query\n      final GroupByQuery innerQuery = new GroupByQuery.Builder(subquery)\n          .setAggregatorSpecs(aggs)\n          .setInterval(subquery.getIntervals())\n

I remember doing this when I was first playing around with the shipped druid examples.  Is there a reason _/etc/druid/historical.runtime.properties_ would not be loaded given this setup?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/132270182/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/132272618","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/1636#issuecomment-132272618","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1636","id":132272618,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMjI3MjYxOA==","user":{"login":"fjy","id":428325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODMyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy","html_url":"https://github.com/fjy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-18T16:48:55Z","updated_at":"2015-08-18T16:48:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@MrAlias I wonder if this is a silly bug in the code, but what happens if you rename historical.runtime.properties to just runtime.properties and make sure it comes after the common.runtime.properties in the classpath?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/132272618/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/132275317","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/1636#issuecomment-132275317","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1636","id":132275317,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMjI3NTMxNw==","user":{"login":"MrAlias","id":5543599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDM1OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5543599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrAlias","html_url":"https://github.com/MrAlias","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrAlias/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrAlias/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrAlias/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrAlias/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrAlias/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrAlias/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrAlias/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrAlias/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrAlias/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-18T16:54:17Z","updated_at":"2015-08-18T16:59:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Yes!
