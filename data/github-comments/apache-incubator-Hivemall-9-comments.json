Indeed, they store data in [][] and few times. Using their code directly causes Java Heap Space, GC errors, etc. (Tested that on my 97 mil of data rows. Newer version of code has same problems.) And you were right about the wonderful CSRMatrix. And DoKMatrix too. They allow to store more data. Thus, more or less, I have changed all the [][] (related to input data) to CSRMatrix and [][] holding weights to  DoKMatrix. \r\n\r\n\r\nTo explain that more, it is best to look at source code for the GISTrainer. In fact all 3 of them, old maxent, new maxent, and Hivemall's BigGISTrainer. The links are below. \r\n\r\nNewer GISTrainer:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/opennlp/blob/master/opennlp-tools/src/main/java/opennlp/tools/ml/maxent/GISTrainer.java\r\n\r\nOlder (3.0.0) GISTrainer:\r\nhttps://sourceforge.net/projects/maxent/files/ - whole achive\r\nGISTrainer attached:\r\n[GISTrainer.txt](https://github.com/apache/incubator-hivemall/files/1192806/GISTrainer.txt)\r\n\r\nHivemall GISTrainer:\r\nhttps://github.com/helenahm/incubator-hivemall/blob/master/core/src/main/java/hivemall/opennlp/tools/BigGISTrainer.java\r\n\r\nNotice how trainModel of BigGISTrainer gets MatrixForTraining (https://github.com/helenahm/incubator-hivemall/blob/master/core/src/main/java/hivemall/opennlp/tools/MatrixForTraining.java), that contains references to Matrix, and outcomes. This is CSRMatrix. \r\n\r\nAnd row data is collected from the CSRMatrix in MatrixForTraining instead of the double[][]. \r\n\r\nwhen\r\nComparableEvent ev = x.createComparableEvent(ti, di.getPredicateIndex(), di.getOMap());\r\n(they use this convenience Event thing to work with a row of data. Instead of storing a List of Events in memory the modified code also builds an event when needed.)\r\n\r\nand results are stored in \r\nMatrix predCount = new DoKMatrix(numPreds, numOutcomes); instead of [][] again.\r\n\r\nGISTrainer did not change very dramatically. If 3.0.0 training is reliable enough, I would, of course, consider the existing version as 1.0, and did all the effort to adapt newer GISTrainer later on. It makes sense to do that, I totally agree. And perhaps it makes sense to continue after that to understanding training process in greater details and perhaps write a newer comparable trainer that will be independent from OpenNLP.
