walkthrough of how Geode uses this new internal serialization filter API. Please note this is an INTERNAL API so we can make further changes for refinement anytime.\r\n\r\n`InternalDataSerializer` uses `DelegatingObjectInputFilterFactory` which delegates to a reflective wrapper for **Java's ObjectInputFilter API** which changed in newer Java versions. `InternalDataSerializer` uses the following classes in the geode-serialization API:\r\n```\r\nInternalDataSerializer -uses-> DelegatingObjectInputFilterFactory\r\nInternalDataSerializer -uses-> NullObjectInputFilter\r\nInternalDataSerializer -uses-> ObjectInputFilter\r\nInternalDataSerializer -uses-> ObjectInputFilterFactory\r\nInternalDataSerializer -uses-> SanctionedSerializableService\r\nInternalDataSerializer -uses-> SerializableObjectConfig\r\n```\r\n\r\n`LocatorLauncher` uses `EnabledGlobalSerialFilterConfigurationFactory` to decorate `DelegatingGlobalSerialFilterFactory` with extra logic for conditions that must be met in order for serialization filtering to be enabled. My aim was for `EnabledGlobalSerialFilterConfigurationFactory` to decorate by composition rather than inheritance, which follows \"Composition over inheritance (or composite reuse principle)\".\r\n```\r\nLocatorLauncher -uses-> DistributedSerializableObjectConfig \r\nLocatorLauncher -uses-> EnabledGlobalSerialFilterConfigurationFactory\r\n```\r\n\r\n`LocatorLauncher` changes existing product behavior by enabling a global serial filter (aka process-wide filter affecting every `ObjectInputStream`) only if the new system property **_geode.enableGlobalSerialFilter_** is set to \"true\" (default is \"false\"). This is the only change in behavior in this PR. The rest of the PR is a refactoring that I tried to have define a (hopefully) well-organized  internal API within geode-serialization. _I would like to request extra attention in reviewing of EnabledGlobalSerialFilterConfigurationFactory and this new system property._\r\n\r\n`DistributionConfig` extends `SerializableObjectConfig` in order to be used as a `SerializableObjectConfig` by the serialization filter API. `DistributedSerializableObjectConfig` is only used when an instance of `DistributionConfig` cannot be available because there is no `DistributedSystem` connection (yet) in the local process.\r\n```\r\nDistributionConfig -implements-> SerializableObjectConfig\r\nDistributedSerializableObjectConfig -implements-> SerializableObjectConfig\r\n```\r\n\r\n`SystemManagementService` uses `EnabledJmxSerialFilterConfigurationFactory` to inject an instance of `FilterConfiguration` into `ManagementAgent`. `ManagementAgent` then activates it by invoking configure when the agent starts.\r\n```\r\nManagementAgent -uses-> FilterConfiguration\r\nManagementAgentFactory -uses-> FilterConfiguration\r\nSystemManagementService -uses-> EnabledJmxSerialFilterConfigurationFactory\r\nSystemManagementService -uses-> FilterConfiguration\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/1006912891/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/1007035687","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/7221#issuecomment-1007035687","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/7221","id":1007035687,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAhObV848BiUn","user":{"login":"lgtm-com[bot]","id":43144390,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDMxNDQzOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/17324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/lgtm-com","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-07T00:16:52Z","updated_at":"2022-01-07T00:16:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This pull request **introduces 2 alerts** when merging 1d03c59df85b18ce7c0f305f7a1ad135a3ebe092 into eb6a0dca57cb411eb6cb7ac31906f1e7d111b3b9 - [view on LGTM.com](https://lgtm.com/projects/g/apache/geode/rev/pr-26a2f56fd3560c0bcee146e3d4f27144837c0611)\n\n**new alerts:**\n\n* 1 for Dereferenced variable may be null\n* 1 for Boxed variable is never null","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/1007035687/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/1007066500","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/7245#issuecomment-1007066500","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/7245","id":1007066500,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAhObV848Bp2E","user":{"login":"demery-pivotal","id":45369324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzY5MzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45369324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/demery-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-07T01:27:55Z","updated_at":"2022-01-07T01:27:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I changed the names of the new classes after I wrote the commit message.
