I've changed according to your comments except `HashMap`. \n\nI chose `HashMap` because it's more primitive class. As you know, `HashSet` uses `HashMap`, so `HashSet` has more overhead than `HashMap` in terms of CPU/Memory. After updating the code according to your comments, I made and tested `HashSet` version multiple times again. The result shows `HashSet` version does not outperform the original `for-loop` version sometimes for some `n`.\n\nAlthough there is a readability issue, I think this patch is meaningful only when it outperforms the original version.\n\nAnd, I rebased and clean up the code for merging.

Is there a better pattern to use that I am not familiar with?\n2. Do we want to throw the Exception if the Tasklet(s) have failed? Or should we provide some Report format?\n3.

Assume that a single worker has 3 Tasklets (A, B, and C) for this example, here would be how Tasklet failures are dealt with:\n1. The A, B, and C fail individually -- the worker will create a single `WorkerReport`, with 3 `TaskletReports` of type `TaskletFailureReport`, each with the individual Exception that caused each its corresponding Tasklet to fail. The master, in this scenario, will invoke `VortexFutureDelegate.threwException` 3 times, each time only with a single item in the list and single Exception that caused the Tasklet to fail.\n2. Tasklet A fails on its own, Tasklets B and C ran to succession but fail on aggregation -- the worker will create a single `WorkerReport`, with 2 `TaskletReports` of type `TaskletFailureReport`. The first `TaskletReport` will only contain Tasklet A in the list, and the Exception that caused Tasklet A to fail. The second `TaskletReport` will contain both Tasklet B and C in the list, and the Exception that caused the aggregation of Tasklet A and B to fail. The master, in this scenario, will invoke `VortexFutureDelegate.threwException` 2 times, the first time corresponding to Tasklet A's failure, the second time corresponding to Tasklet B and C's aggregation failure.\n3. Tasklet A, B, and C all ran to succession, but fail on aggregation -- the worker will create a single `WorkerReport`, with a single `TaskletReport of type`TaskletFailureReport`. The`TaskletReport`will contain all 3 Tasklets in the list, and the single Exception that caused the aggregation of the 3 Tasklets to fail. The master, in this scenario, will invoke`VortexFutureDelegate.threwException` only 1 time, with Tasklets A, B, and C in the list, and the Exception corresponding to the Exception that caused the aggregation to fail.\n4. The worker itself fails before reporting back to the master -- The master gets informed of the worker failure. Since it knows which Tasklets have not yet completed, it simply reschedules those Tasklets on another worker. `VortexFutureDelegate` does not get invoked until the Worker(s) that pick up the Tasklets report back.\n5. The worker fails after reporting back to the master -- The master doesn't care, since the Tasklets have already completed. `VortexFutureDelegate` has already been invoked.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/166008823/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/166009749","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/738#issuecomment-166009749","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/738","id":166009749,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NjAwOTc0OQ==","user":{"login":"afchung","id":2817619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTc2MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2817619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung","html_url":"https://github.com/afchung","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-19T17:45:09Z","updated_at":"2015-12-19T17:45:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"In short, a `TaskletReport` corresponds to a call to a method in `VortexFutureDelegate`.
