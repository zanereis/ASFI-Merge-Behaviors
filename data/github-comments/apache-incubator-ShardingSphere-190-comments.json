How do you think?\r\n\r\nHI @tristaZero ,Your suggestion is good,but in some company,the super user can't be granted for devloper team. In sharding jdbc, the loadAllTableNames method invoke jdbc driver for getting result. I have tried, mysql driver will only return the tables that has  permission. so it is ok for mysql.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/813207200/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/813314019","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/pull/9846#issuecomment-813314019","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/9846","id":813314019,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxMzMxNDAxOQ==","user":{"login":"tristaZero","id":27757146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NzU3MTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27757146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero","html_url":"https://github.com/tristaZero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-05T09:56:42Z","updated_at":"2021-04-05T09:56:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi

Hi @huanghao495430759 , I have no longer questions on this PR, nice.

That will be simple to fix since @terrymanu just adjust the packages.\r\n> Besides, if you have any confusion about integration tests, please ping @JiekerTime here.
