The current PR is not actually merging yet so nothing to be done wrt ansible.\n\n@domdom82 In an earlier PR, I had moved the controller from edge to master.  I updated a controller.yam file as Hoang agreed that it would be ok.  The current PR isn't moving anything so it doesn't matter.   The next step (work about to start on this) will the the final merge.  **Does it suffice to simply disable the deployment of the load balancer?**\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/205320329/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/205326382","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/147#issuecomment-205326382","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/147","id":205326382,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNTMyNjM4Mg==","user":{"login":"ioana-blue","id":17202292,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjAyMjky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17202292?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue","html_url":"https://github.com/ioana-blue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-04T14:39:24Z","updated_at":"2016-04-04T14:39:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I agree, this test needs to be removed since it's subsumed by the ConsulKV tests.

@seriousme thanks for your excellent input.\n\nI think it is a great idea to have the stack as compose topology on dockerhub. \n\nBefore we do that we should first reduce the image sizes so ppl won't have to download huge chunks.\n\nMost images are based on whisk/scala which itself is pretty large. That itself can be reduced imho.\n\nAs for the consul part, we are currently working on moving to ansible for our deployment. During that process we are also looking into ways to reduce overhead on common tools such as consul which we currently build ourselves. So chances are we got rid of that image

Thanks for the positive feedback :-)\n\nI found a relatively small scala package [frolvlad](https://hub.docker.com/r/frolvlad/alpine-scala/) based on Alpine Linux.

Just run a separate load balancer.  This was falsely attractive in that it worked right out of the box - discovered by accident.

The activator needs significant rework and also does complicated things like dynamically update topics.  Seems too involved to move it at this point.\n3.
