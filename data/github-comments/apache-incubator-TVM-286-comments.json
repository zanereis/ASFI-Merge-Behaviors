Introducing a class should be more readable. \r\n* Do not use weird type name like `RUNTIME_PIPELINE_OUTPUT_CONF`.

I haven't been able to reproduce it locally in the same way it's failing in the CI. However, at one point during development, we were failing to kill the qemu process and thereby leaving ~10 qemu-system-arm running. If you used a less powerful machine, you could reproduce a similar effect. \r\n\r\nWhen I was able to reproduce this locally, I connected to the emulated ARM system via gdb and reset it. This timeout occurs while TVM is waiting to read an RPC reply from the emulated serial port. I was able to observe that, after resetting the emulated ARM system (while TVM was waiting for a reply), the rebooted ARM system could actually send UART data and TVM could read that data. However, the ARM system did not seem to be able to receive UART data from TVM.\r\n\r\nThis leads me to suspect one of two root causes:\r\n1) a bug in the Zephyr firmware for MPS2_AN521 that may only manifest itself on QEMU\r\n2) a race condition in the Zephyr qemu UART emulation that fails to transmit data *to* the ARM system, but can read it back just fine.\r\n\r\n@gromero was investigating this before I went on PTO Aug 19. any updates? Perhaps we should consider temporarily disabling mps2_an521 until we can root-cause and fix this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/912444859/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/912514479","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/8728#issuecomment-912514479","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8728","id":912514479,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM42Y92v","user":{"login":"ashutosh-arm","id":86472128,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NDcyMTI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/86472128?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashutosh-arm","html_url":"https://github.com/ashutosh-arm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashutosh-arm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashutosh-arm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashutosh-arm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashutosh-arm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashutosh-arm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashutosh-arm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashutosh-arm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashutosh-arm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashutosh-arm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-03T12:50:42Z","updated_at":"2021-09-03T12:50:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"https://ci.tlcpack.ai/job/tvm/job/PR-8833/6/consoleFull I got this a few days back as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/912514479/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/912547181","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8720#issuecomment-912547181","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8720","id":912547181,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM42ZF1t","user":{"login":"manupak","id":61496855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNDk2ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61496855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak","html_url":"https://github.com/manupak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-03T13:38:10Z","updated_at":"2021-09-03T13:38:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@areusch can you take another look ?

I suppose that the problem is happened because `fn` is a `PackedFunction` with python function. And CloudPickle is not able to serialize native `PackedFunction` object. \r\n\r\nAnother idea how we can quick fix this problem: move `tar` and `ndk` functions to the `_local_build_worker` and pass only names \"tar\" or \"ndk\" to it and select implementation there. In this case it would work for current tvm defined custom functions. In case when passed name is not \"tar\" or \"ndk\", then we will have another argument with callable function. It won't work now. Because of this problem with packed functions but we can fix it in the next PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/912558170/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/912565725","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8926#issuecomment-912565725","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8926","id":912565725,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM42ZKXd","user":{"login":"Mousius","id":4933431,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MzM0MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4933431?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius","html_url":"https://github.com/Mousius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-03T14:05:14Z","updated_at":"2021-09-03T14:05:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Also CC @mbs-octoml @electriclilies for reviews :smile_cat: ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/912565725/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/912571387","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8886#issuecomment-912571387","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8886","id":912571387,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM42ZLv7","user":{"login":"leandron","id":437416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzQxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/437416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron","html_url":"https://github.com/leandron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-03T14:13:16Z","updated_at":"2021-09-03T14:13:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This is merged now, thanks @electriclilies @Mousius and @mbs-octoml!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/912571387/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/912586794","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8492#issuecomment-912586794","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8492","id":912586794,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM42ZPgq","user":{"login":"vinx13","id":7195739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxOTU3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7195739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13","html_url":"https://github.com/vinx13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-03T14:35:28Z","updated_at":"2021-09-03T14:35:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The finding looks correct.

I am happy to take out the typing changes if that's what it takes to get Hardmax in, but I would share a different perspective first based on a previous experience. \r\n\r\nAt $prevjob I worked on a large python repo that was also initially untyped (but wanted to eventually be fully-typed) and we found that the best way to do this was for devs to add typings in and around old code as they went, rather than making separate, self-contained efforts to add types. We learned that the latter was difficult to rely upon because, with feature work and other responsibilities, finding dedicated time to go and fix up old files just didn't happen. On the other hand, embracing the first approach ended up creating a culture of leaving files you touch better than you found them amongst developers, which more organically distributed the burden of adding types. Gradually, that code base was able to become fully-typed.\r\n\r\nI would suggest we take the same approach here, particularly because TVM's CI duration adds a non-trivial time/attention cost to making any change, further discouraging standalone cleanups. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know WYT @AndrewZhaoLuo @jwfromm .

Now if you submitted an RFC which suggested this doctrine I would of course be amenable. \r\n\r\nAs for TVM CI duration, I understand you want to get these changes in as fast as possible, but unless this is actively unblocking someone or CI I do not see this change as important enough to warrant a rushed job. Anyways, we want discussion on the typing changes and ideally we want those threads to be separate from the hardmax changes. \r\n\r\nHere is what I suggest. Rewind this PR back to 6a0041d and submit the branch in it's current state as a separate PR. Require merging this PR first before the other.

Just one random thought out of this issue that may further improve TVM: is the layout annotation imposing too many unnecessary constraints (i.e., asserting semantics of each dimension)? Will it be better to not annotate layout itself, but instead annotate how the layout got transformed?\r\n\r\nAs in this case, previously TVM assumes `NK` for the second operand, which essentially constraints the 1st dimension to have the *semantic* of \"batch\" and the 2nd \"units\". This is why this issue happens: another operation assumes a semantic of `NC` which conflicts with `NK`.\r\n\r\nHowever, I feel like what `AlterOpLayout` needs is only how the layouts are transformed before and after the pass (e.g., the 2nd dimension is split by a factor of xxx), and it does not care about the semantics at all. The current fix solves the issue for `nn.dense`, but it seems the fundamental issue still exists. For example, `F.conv2d(x, F.conv2d(y, z))` will be broken too (though I guess this is a weird pattern that may not occur in practice?).\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/912787653/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/912794862","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/8879#issuecomment-912794862","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8879","id":912794862,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM42aCTu","user":{"login":"vinx13","id":7195739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxOTU3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7195739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13","html_url":"https://github.com/vinx13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-03T20:33:08Z","updated_at":"2021-09-03T20:33:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"You can make locally by `make doc` in the tvm root directory.\r\ncc @hogepodge @tqchen shall we consider hosting docs of previous versions?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/912794862/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/912803305","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8921#issuecomment-912803305","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8921","id":912803305,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM42aEXp","user":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-03T20:51:25Z","updated_at":"2021-09-03T20:51:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@lazycal That is an interesting suggestion.
