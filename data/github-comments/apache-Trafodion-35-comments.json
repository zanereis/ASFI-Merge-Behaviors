These are the general guidelines to be followed to review this change if it is syntactically correct. For semantics correctness, please feel free to weigh in your expertise. \n\na) No method should be declared as throws Exception - The exception should be more specific like IOException\nb) Ensure that only specific exceptions are caught - Shouldn't contain catch(Exception e) when needed.\nc) Avoid catching a specific exception just to throw it back as the same exception. If it is morphed into a different exception, it could be ok.\n 4) Log.Error and throw from the exception handler should not miss the original exception. It should take in the exception as a parameter so that the original exception is not missed out.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/218847379/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/218856589","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/474#issuecomment-218856589","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/474","id":218856589,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxODg1NjU4OQ==","user":{"login":"hegdean","id":12959032,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTU5MDMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12959032?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hegdean","html_url":"https://github.com/hegdean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hegdean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hegdean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hegdean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hegdean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hegdean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hegdean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hegdean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hegdean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hegdean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-12T19:11:54Z","updated_at":"2016-05-12T19:11:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Will
