There is a way to skip this step by adding 'skipsdist = True' under '[tox]'. However I am strongly against doing this because, this would mean that our users will require lxml package to be installed prior to creating a source distribution and later for installing and testing. I would rather avoid any dependencies that could not be managed by setup.py itself.\n\nI am fine with a dirtier parsing approach. Just to clarify, I assume this will involve some simple string searches rather than a complex xml parsing.\n\nOn a separate note while I was trying to install lxml on one of my computers I got an error like this 'Could not find function xmlCheckVersion in library libxml2. Is libxml2 installed?' I think this it by itself a good reason to avoid this dependency. It is plausible that some of our users will end up seeing this error too.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/230013876/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/230016923","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/540#issuecomment-230016923","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/540","id":230016923,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMDAxNjkyMw==","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-01T18:28:43Z","updated_at":"2016-07-01T18:28:43Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"OK, that's all for my first pass.
