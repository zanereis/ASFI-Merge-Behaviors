Recommend updating to 'The effective flowfile operated on will be the most recent version of content and attributes known for this flowfile identity in this session.'\r\n- Recursive read allowance.  I think i get where this was going but i think something isnt quite right with it.  If we're going to allow/track multiple readers then we need to be doing it via a reference counter type logic i believe.\r\n- It doesn't look like this is quite true still right?  It is now more flexible in that it does allow multiple readers for a given flowfile.  So we need to make sure we're clear about the allowed pattern here which I think is we can have multiple readers to the flowfile but *not* if we have a writer to that flowfile.

Please make sure to think of anything we might be missing there.  I suspect API docs are sufficient to properly articulate this now more relaxed contraint in terms of developer flexibility (but not relaxed in terms of nifi's ability to enforce the critical conditions are still held).\r\n\r\nAnyway - happy to take a look once the above is responded to/addressed as necessary.  I definitely see how this will help developers have a more flexible/intuitive interaction with the process session while we still hold the critical aspects firm.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/300795056/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/300805815","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1772#issuecomment-300805815","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1772","id":300805815,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMDgwNTgxNQ==","user":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-11T14:25:50Z","updated_at":"2017-05-11T14:25:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mattyb149 I just pushed a new commit that should address the issue that you noticed here with the differing schemas.

Sounds good!  I propose we incorporate this PR for the time being to solve the prior two cases listed in the mentioned JIRAs and can open up a new JIRA to track issues with Salt and presumably other tools/scripts that may be Python driven.  @gresockj let me know your thoughts.  I will create a separate issue to track the Python side of the house.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/301570606/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/301571413","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1786#issuecomment-301571413","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1786","id":301571413,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMTU3MTQxMw==","user":{"login":"apiri","id":502889,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjg4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/502889?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri","html_url":"https://github.com/apiri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-15T18:59:55Z","updated_at":"2017-05-15T18:59:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Created https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-3899","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/301571413/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/301571936","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1786#issuecomment-301571936","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1786","id":301571936,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMTU3MTkzNg==","user":{"login":"kevdoran","id":5102332,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMDIzMzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5102332?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevdoran","html_url":"https://github.com/kevdoran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevdoran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevdoran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevdoran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevdoran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevdoran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevdoran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevdoran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevdoran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevdoran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-15T19:01:51Z","updated_at":"2017-05-15T19:01:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@apiri sounds good","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/301571936/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/301576045","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1737#issuecomment-301576045","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1737","id":301576045,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMTU3NjA0NQ==","user":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-15T19:17:47Z","updated_at":"2017-05-15T19:17:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 LGTM, ran the tests again and tried on a NiFi instance, using prefix and/or message with and without Expression Language.

I can understand not needing them in labels, component names, etc., but how are they handled if entered into a text field for a processor property that needs them (i.e. byte boundary searching, control characters, etc.)? An alternative to just dropping the illegal characters completely is to Base64 encode them for serialization to (GZIP) XML and then decode on deserialization. This would result in no data loss. \r\n\r\nI was able to verify that entering the Unicode escape characters through the UI successfully escaped them, but I was then able to modify the `flow.xml.gz` file on disk and manually insert invalid characters (see screenshots). On startup, the app still throws an exception in the stack trace.
