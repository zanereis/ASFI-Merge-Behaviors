discuss the proposal with @houshengbo here is my summary:\n\nThe split will be `openwhisk` vs `openwhisk-catalog`\n\n## openwhisk\n\n`openwhisk` does not depend on `openwhisk-catalog`\nThe `catalog` folder doesn't exist anymore\nNo packages will be install by default (build, deploy, vagrant) on this repo\nUser will need to manually (or via script) install packages repos\nTests in openwhisk should not depend on any package repos including `openwhisk-catalog`\nAny current tests that depend on catalog, should be refactor to use a new test fixture, or move the test to the package repo if it make sense. \nNeed to look at each test to see if the test is testing the package, or testing a core functionality\n\n## openwhisk-catalog\n\n`openwhisk-catalog` depends on `openwhisk`\nContain the a core set of packages\nContain the test cases to test the packages\nConfigured with Travis for CI to run the tests\nAny package that requires a credential for testing, it should use the Travis encryption service so test can run automatically in the Travis Cloud\nUser should be able to run the tests locally by providing his own credentials for the any services that test cases depend on (Slack, Watson, Github, etc..)\nTo work with the repo an user will do something like this:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk-catalog\ncd openwhisk-catalog\ngit clone https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk\nOPENWHISK_HOME=$(cd openwhisk && pwd)\ncd $OPENWHISK_HOME\ngit checkout (pinned hash or master)\n.... build and deploy (redo setup prereq couchdb initdb deploy) \n../packages/install.sh $APIHOST $AUTH $WSK_CLI\n... use the packages as normal using WSK CLI\n... run tests the packages \nedit ../packages/tests/credentials.json \ncp -a ../packages/tests/  tests/src/packages/\ngradlew tests:test --tests packages.*\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/229126594/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/229131365","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/783#issuecomment-229131365","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/783","id":229131365,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyOTEzMTM2NQ==","user":{"login":"dubee","id":11520887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIwODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11520887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee","html_url":"https://github.com/dubee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-28T18:02:13Z","updated_at":"2016-06-28T18:02:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Do

final solution will heavily depend on how the overall openwhisk components obtain their build timestamps.  In other projects I've been on, this is centrally controlled by top level build constructs and conveyed to the individual component builds.  That way it's easy to see that a specific combination of components was all built at the same time.  If the Go CLI sets it's build timestamp inside the dockerfile, it will be unique to just the Go CLI.  The solution I chose, assumed the former architecture; however, if that is not how the design plays out, then the Go CLI is free to generated its own build timestamp.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/229157883/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/229173687","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/783#issuecomment-229173687","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/783","id":229173687,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyOTE3MzY4Nw==","user":{"login":"dubee","id":11520887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIwODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11520887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee","html_url":"https://github.com/dubee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-28T20:31:55Z","updated_at":"2016-06-28T20:31:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":":+1: \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/229173687/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/229175671","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/783#issuecomment-229175671","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/783","id":229175671,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyOTE3NTY3MQ==","user":{"login":"mdeuser","id":18535381,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTM1Mzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18535381?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser","html_url":"https://github.com/mdeuser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-28T20:38:46Z","updated_at":"2016-06-28T20:38:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@csantanapr -
