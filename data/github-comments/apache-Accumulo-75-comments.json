Waiting to backport to 1.10 will delay getting it pushed to the clusters currently losing files.\r\n\r\nIf the changes are so substantial that it will be that difficult to apply to 2.1.0-SNAPSHOT, and that difficulty is enough to cause a delay, then it is even *more* important that we get it right in 2.1 first, so we don't create churn by applying one implementation to 1.10, a more well-vetted different implementation in 2.1, and then needing to backport the final implementation back to 1.10.\r\n\r\nI'm not suggesting 2.1 be released first... only that we have a relatively concrete idea of what the destination looks like, so that we know the 1.10 implementation is moving in that direction and not away from it.\r\n\r\nWhat I'd like to avoid is something like the debacle with https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ACCUMULO-4086; there, we had a patch donated for an older version that wasn't thoroughly tested or code reviewed by us. They donated it to the project, where it got a lot of code review and polishing before being applied to 2.0. The implementation was improved through that process, but the end result was different enough that the original authors would have had a bit of a headache migrating on upgrade if they had been running using the original patch.\r\n\r\nSo, we need to make sure that the implementation aligns with the direction the project is headed, rather than where it has been, to avoid those kinds of user headaches. That said, if a user wants to run with a pre-release patched version of 1.10, before we've polished it in 2.x, that's their prerogative. But, I would like to have some confidence we're not applying something in 1.10.2 that is radically different than the direction we're heading with 2.1.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/951376349/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/951400036","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/2305#issuecomment-951400036","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/2305","id":951400036,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM44tTZk","user":{"login":"EdColeman","id":7047700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDc3MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7047700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman","html_url":"https://github.com/EdColeman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-25T23:03:40Z","updated_at":"2021-10-25T23:03:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"From what I've looked at so far, this looks okay.  There are some minor check-style issues and one issue with reporting \r\n`unknown` metrics \r\n\r\nI'm still looking, but my one concern so far deals with the reporting op types in Fate metrics.  The op_types used to be a map of counters (op_name, metric counter) that were generated dynamically. When an op_type was first seen, a map entry was created and then it would be incremented each time it was seen again.  The op types were not predefined, but they are also a finite set.

If there would be starvation, it could have happened before this change.  This change slightly improved the current default way of prioritizing that has the goal of reducing the avg number of files per tablet across the tserver.  I suspect any priority scheme that does not explicitly incorporate age always has some non-zero chance of starvation for a particular tablet.\r\n\r\nThis is based on memory, so I may be wrong, prior to the compaction changes in 2.1 the priority mechanism may have been hard coded w/o any for a user to change it. \r\n\r\n>  I'm thinking about the case where you have unbalanced ingest into a table, will you run into a case where compactions never happen for tablets that have a light amount of ingest because the tablets that have a large amount of ingest activity are constantly compacting?\r\n\r\nIn addition to giving user control over priority, 2.1 gives users another way to manage this situation.  Users can assign tables to different compaction services which can allows tables to be placed on different queues and thread pools.\r\n\r\nThe situation of starvation can only happen when queues are constantly full. I had to limit the compaction threads to one for the test just to force the condition of the queue always being full.  When the queues were not always full, I did not observe any impact from this change.\r\n\r\nOne other thing to consider when thinking about starvation is that user compactions are prioritized over system compactions in the default prio mechanism.  So system compactions can never starve user compactions.  For system compactions, I don't think the age really matters, just compact the tablet that will yield the most impact.  However for user compactions, maybe we should consider the age.  That way an older user compaction is not starved by newer user compaction.  May be good to open an issue about changing the default prio mechanism of user compactions to consider age.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/953853715/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/953868025","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/2332#issuecomment-953868025","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/2332","id":953868025,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM442t75","user":{"login":"milleruntime","id":11872539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODcyNTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11872539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime","html_url":"https://github.com/milleruntime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-28T13:54:00Z","updated_at":"2021-10-28T13:54:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Unlinked since it will close the issue before both ITs are fixed.\r\n\r\nThanks.

Yeah, sure, *maybe* you can cut around the problem, and continue eating safely, but it's not a great idea. When mold occurs, you can't trust that there's not mold in smaller, less visible amounts on the rest of the loaf. Similarly, when an Error occurs, I don't see how you can trust the rest of the state of the JVM... especially something like OutOfMemoryError, which can have cascading effects on other threads in the JVM, possibly really important ones in your dependent libraries or even internal to Java itself. Errors aren't just something you can catch, clean up, and have confidence that all is fine afterwards... they reflect a serious problem with the overall state of the application. Java's own documentation says that these are likely not recoverable, so I have a hard time understanding the desire to try to recover from them, or the confidence that one will actually be able to pull it off reliably without unforeseen consequences.\r\n\r\nEven if we were to make OutOfMemoryError in these particular threads not terminal, we can't assume Errors in the general case are safe enough to try to handle. So, we'd have to start baking in heuristics to try to determine which of the \"likely not recoverable\" errors we believe are more likely than others to be able to recover from, and we have to include assumptions about what triggered the Error as part of those heuristics. Or, we have to treat them all the same, and pass these through to calling client code, to let them decide what to do. Either way, that seems likely to increase code complexity, to support highly questionable behavior.\r\n\r\nIf there's a high demand or strong use case for it, I suppose I could support the idea of making the uncaught exception handler pluggable via client API. But, it really seems like a bad idea to me (for an implementation to do anything other than try to shut the JVM down as quickly as possible)... just like moldy bread.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/956451489/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/956512589","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/2331#issuecomment-956512589","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/2331","id":956512589,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM45AzlN","user":{"login":"dlmarion","id":567911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NzkxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/567911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion","html_url":"https://github.com/dlmarion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-01T19:11:35Z","updated_at":"2021-11-01T19:11:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"So, two other related thoughts here:\r\n\r\n1. There are many flavors of OutOfMemoryError. I imagine that you are trying to handle the case where it's \"java heap space\" by trying to create a smaller object (From what I read, Java heap space is thrown based on a pre-calculation of the size of the object being allocated and the max heap size, thus the VM didn't really run out of memory). It's not clear to me how you would handle other flavors of OutOfMemoryError: direct memory, metaspace, gc overhead limit exceeded, etc.\r\n\r\n2. I don't see how you can effectively handle the \"java heap space\" OOME when it occurs in another thread. The asynchronous nature of this definitely increases the complexity.\r\n\r\nA lot of the recommendations for handling OOME's deal with finding memory leaks and/or changing VM parameters. There is also the case where it's not a leak and the application is trying to allocate more memory than it was given, which leads back to changing VM parameters.\r\n\r\nThis is also a good time to remind that there are new VM [options](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8258058) for exiting the VM on OOME, which seem handy, but do [not](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8155004) work when the reason for OOME is the inability to create a new native thread.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/956512589/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/956515666","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/2331#issuecomment-956515666","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/2331","id":956515666,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM45A0VS","user":{"login":"dlmarion","id":567911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NzkxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/567911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion","html_url":"https://github.com/dlmarion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-01T19:15:46Z","updated_at":"2021-11-01T19:16:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ctubbsii  - do you have any thoughts on not halting the VM from the AccumuloUncaughtExceptionHandler when it's being used in a client application?

The one I see regularly is the 'direct memory' flavor. This one occurs when you try to allocate a direct byte buffer, but you've reached your pre-configured direct memory limit. This happens because direct memory is only freed after DBBs are GC'd. This is unlike normal resources where you can call close() and the resource is freed immediately. DBBs are used in Hadoop (and Thrift apparently) to improve I/O performance. Therefore, as long as you wait a little while, direct memory OOM errors will eventually go away and they don't have anything to do with normal JVM memory.\n\n2. The other case is less exact but I still encounter it frequently. Suppose you have N threads each executing a high memory consuming operation local to the thread. Then suppose you run out of memory or reach the GC overhead limit in one or more of them, provoking a OOM error. In this situation, once the thread is terminated, the GC can run, and the JVM will have plenty of memory free again.\n\nEither way, it doesn't matter who caused the OOM error. It is up to the library maintainer to ensure resources are properly freed *in all cases*. The JVM itself does this with the try-with-resources construct. It doesn't stop to verify whether or not the exception that's unrolling the stack is a Error. It just closes the resource it's managing.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/957004905/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/957049695","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/2331#issuecomment-957049695","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/2331","id":957049695,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM45C2tf","user":{"login":"andrewglowacki","id":5504606,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDQ2MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5504606?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewglowacki","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewglowacki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewglowacki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewglowacki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewglowacki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewglowacki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewglowacki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewglowacki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewglowacki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewglowacki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewglowacki/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-02T02:46:39Z","updated_at":"2021-11-02T02:46:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sorry I think I've gotten this issue quite a bit off topic.

The queued task will catch throwable and the executor would never see any errors.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/accumulo/blob/785a3645261571f000a7adb3c7c72b07886f0587/core/src/main/java/org/apache/accumulo/core/clientImpl/bulk/BulkImport.java#L544-L563\r\n\r\nIf an error did occur the following code would see it wrapped in an ExecutionException and then wrap that in a RuntimeException and punt it back to the user.  So we would still be catching Errors in the Accumulo client code, unless we stop using Java futures.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/accumulo/blob/785a3645261571f000a7adb3c7c72b07886f0587/core/src/main/java/org/apache/accumulo/core/clientImpl/bulk/BulkImport.java#L577-L579\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/959157451/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/959209736","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/2340#issuecomment-959209736","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/2340","id":959209736,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM45LGEI","user":{"login":"dlmarion","id":567911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NzkxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/567911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion","html_url":"https://github.com/dlmarion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-03T14:18:07Z","updated_at":"2021-11-03T14:18:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> If the goal of this change is to make it so that Accumulo client code never has to catch Error\r\n\r\nThis change is to implement your suggestion in #2331 where you said:\r\n\r\n> I am not sure its appropriate for this particular case but one thing to consider in general from an API perspective is letting users pass in ExecutorServices and Thread Factories.\r\n\r\nThere is also a change in this PR to AccumuloUncaughtExceptionHandler where the VM will not be shut down on Error when the thread is not running in an Accumulo Server process (as determined by SingletonManager.getMode).\r\n\r\nRegarding the BulkImport code above, I believe that in this case an Error would be handled by the AccumuloUncaughtExceptionHandler as [this](https://github.com/apache/accumulo/blob/785a3645261571f000a7adb3c7c72b07886f0587/core/src/main/java/org/apache/accumulo/core/clientImpl/bulk/BulkImport.java#L560) catches Exception, not Error, and the executor that is being used to run the CompletableFuture is being created by ThreadPools.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/959209736/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/959243094","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/2342#issuecomment-959243094","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/2342","id":959243094,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM45LONW","user":{"login":"milleruntime","id":11872539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODcyNTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11872539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime","html_url":"https://github.com/milleruntime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-03T14:27:41Z","updated_at":"2021-11-03T14:27:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This test also fails on 2.0.1.
