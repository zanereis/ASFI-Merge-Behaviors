the merge to master didn't go cleanly - see the new PR at #670 to get this to master. there are failing tests. @FlorianHockmann could you have a look at those and see if it is easy to correct? if so, feel free to just push your changes directly to that branch - much easier to do things now that you are a committer :)

anyway, so full support of graphson 3.0 isn't super
