- thank you for your detailed explanation. I did not consider running this on a special environment to simulate the testing env. That is a great point, and something I'll keep in mind in the future.\r\n\r\nBased on the example logging output you provided, it looks like it is still the broker being overridden because it is considered overloaded. See the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n07:04:53.511 [TestNG-method=testBrokerSelectionForAntiAffinityGroup-1] INFO  org.apache.pulsar.broker.loadbalance.impl.ModularLoadManagerImpl - 2 brokers being considered for assignment of tenant-c8478edb-886e-43b7-8d43-12cc159c0eb9/use/ns1/0x00000000_0xffffffff\r\n07:04:53.511 [TestNG-method=testBrokerSelectionForAntiAffinityGroup-1] WARN  org.apache.pulsar.broker.loadbalance.impl.LeastLongTermMessageRate - Broker http://localhost:33199 is overloaded: max usage=1.2440309524536133\r\n07:04:53.511 [TestNG-method=testBrokerSelectionForAntiAffinityGroup-1] WARN  org.apache.pulsar.broker.loadbalance.impl.LeastLongTermMessageRate - Broker localhost:33199 is overloaded: CPU: 124.40309%, MEMORY: 19.42325%, DIRECT MEMORY: 2.4414062%, BANDWIDTH IN: 0.0%, BANDWIDTH OUT: 0.0%\r\n07:04:53.516 [TestNG-method=testBrokerSelectionForAntiAffinityGroup-1] INFO  org.apache.pulsar.broker.loadbalance.impl.ModularLoadManagerImpl - 1 brokers being considered for assignment of tenant-c8478edb-886e-43b7-8d43-12cc159c0eb9/use/ns2/0x00000000_0xffffffff\r\n07:04:53.516 [TestNG-method=testBrokerSelectionForAntiAffinityGroup-1] WARN  org.apache.pulsar.broker.loadbalance.impl.LeastLongTermMessageRate - Broker http://localhost:33199 is overloaded: max usage=1.2440309524536133\r\n07:04:53.516 [TestNG-method=testBrokerSelectionForAntiAffinityGroup-1] WARN  org.apache.pulsar.broker.loadbalance.impl.LeastLongTermMessageRate - Broker localhost:33199 is overloaded: CPU: 124.40309%, MEMORY: 19.42325%, DIRECT MEMORY: 2.4414062%, BANDWIDTH IN: 0.0%, BANDWIDTH OUT: 0.0%\r\n07:04:53.517 [TestNG-method=testBrokerSelectionForAntiAffinityGroup-1] WARN  org.apache.pulsar.broker.loadbalance.impl.LeastLongTermMessageRate - Broker http://localhost:33199 is overloaded: max usage=1.2440309524536133\r\n07:04:53.517 [TestNG-method=testBrokerSelectionForAntiAffinityGroup-1] WARN  org.apache.pulsar.broker.loadbalance.impl.LeastLongTermMessageRate - Broker localhost:33199 is overloaded: CPU: 124.40309%, MEMORY: 19.42325%, DIRECT MEMORY: 2.4414062%, BANDWIDTH IN: 0.0%, BANDWIDTH OUT: 0.0%\r\n```\r\n\r\nGiven the first log line, it does look like two brokers are considered for placement. However, the CPU is listed at 124%, which leads to an override. I mentioned a concern about this in my initial PR message:\r\n\r\n> Note that I am assuming the following method will never return a value greater than 1, which could lead to test failure.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is worth bumping the limit to something like 300 in this one case? If we only have 2 cores, we won't exceed that. Although, that does leave us with the potential to see this flakiness again if we ever give the test more cores.\r\n\r\nDo you think the broker's cpu utilization is high because they are still in the process of starting up? If so, perhaps your suggested `await` command could help by giving the brokers time to stabilize.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/771394148/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/771401543","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/9393#issuecomment-771401543","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/9393","id":771401543,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MTQwMTU0Mw==","user":{"login":"lhotari","id":66864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari","html_url":"https://github.com/lhotari","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-02T06:33:44Z","updated_at":"2021-02-02T06:33:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Perhaps it is worth bumping the limit to something like 300 in this one case?

I don't know this area of Pulsar so I could give a direct advice. \r\n\r\n\r\n> Do you think the broker's cpu utilization is high because they are still in the process of starting up? If so, perhaps your suggested `await` command could help by giving the brokers time to stabilize.\r\n\r\nMy assumption was simply that the test might start executing before both brokers are available. That has been a source of flakiness at least in DiscoveryServiceTest. I didn't confirm this assumption in any way. A simple approach would be to experiment and check whether the problem reproduces after making changes. Being able to experiment, would require having ways to reproduce the issue in environment where you can quickly run experiments. \r\n\r\nbtw. I have published my \"toolbox\" as open source in https://github.com/lhotari/pulsar-contributor-toolbox . That contains shell script functions that I use for reproducing Pulsar flaky test failures. It works for me when I use Linux, zsh & sdkman (for JDK installation).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/771401543/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/771402995","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/9409#issuecomment-771402995","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/9409","id":771402995,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MTQwMjk5NQ==","user":{"login":"lhotari","id":66864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari","html_url":"https://github.com/lhotari","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-02T06:36:56Z","updated_at":"2021-02-02T06:36:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@jiazhai No I'm not working on this one.
