@risdenk I know you introduced this plugin but IMO it's more annoying & burdensome than helpful. Maybe we should back out this plugin? I was somewhat appreciative of the Maven equivalent, which had some imperfections but mostly worked. The Gradle one seems more troublesome, requiring that we explicitly list dependencies that are not in fact directly used. Nowadays, I just want the build to be simpler.\r\n> \r\n> JIRA issues aren't required for build improvements in general.\r\n\r\nsince we talked about this during the community meeting - I agree the verbosity is a pain but this basically moves runtime issues into build time issues. Every case I've looked into the classes/dependencies in question were used in the code somewhere. There could be bugs in the plugin but they seem to get fixed overtime. It usually is the case the plugin seems to miss things that needed to be included (which is what this upgrade addresses). I haven't seen a case where a dependency needed to be declared but then wasn't actually used.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2305202519/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2305596913","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2659#issuecomment-2305596913","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2659","id":2305596913,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6JbJ3x","user":{"login":"epugh","id":22395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh","html_url":"https://github.com/epugh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-22T20:42:15Z","updated_at":"2024-08-22T20:42:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ready for review!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2305596913/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2305937455","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2477#issuecomment-2305937455","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2477","id":2305937455,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6JcdAv","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-23T00:00:23Z","updated_at":"2024-08-23T00:00:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This PR has had no activity for 60 days and is now labeled as stale.

This PR presumes that if we hit a failure we just want to quit as soon as possible. There are certainly use cases where partial results are not useful and loosing some of them is not a worry, but this is not always true. Imagine if you are serving products to be displayed for sale. You may want to collect as many as possible, because an error may cause the user to bounce of the site, and the less results shown, the less likely a sale. This type of use case is the what the code currently supports so in 17158 I tried to retain that default behavior and if the user specifies that they don't care about partial results I try to pick up additional gains by not returning any partials at all (less data over the wire).\r\n\r\nSo 17158 essentially provides a least effort mode as an alternative to the default best effort mode. This is also part of why it is longer. I'm working on a slimmed down version of the prior PR eliminating a few simple refactors and touch ups that crept in added to the complexity/file count.

This PR presumes that if we hit a failure we just want to quit as soon as possible. There are certainly use cases where partial results are not useful and loosing some of them is not a worry, but this is not always true. Imagine if you are serving products to be displayed for sale. You may want to collect as many as possible, because an error may cause the user to bounce of the site, and the less results shown, the less likely a sale. This type of use case is the what the code currently supports so in 17158 I tried to retain that default behavior and if the user specifies that they don't care about partial results I try to pick up additional gains by not returning any partials at all (less data over the wire).\r\n> \r\n> So 17158 essentially provides a least effort mode as an alternative to the default best effort mode. This is also part of why it is longer. I'm working on a slimmed down version of the prior PR eliminating a few simple refactors and touch ups that crept in added to the complexity/file count. The old PR can't continue because it predates the move to CompletableFuture.\r\n\r\nThanks @gus-asf. I guess this time out case falls into `shards.tolerant=true`, if that returns partial response then application should be fine with that?

I guess this is now built-in?\r\n\r\nYes this one does confused me in the start, as I removed the plugin declaration and retry was still working. Then I start looking into all the plugin in `build.gradle` one by one, hoping that it is coming with one of them. Ultimately, I discovered below dependencies in `setting.gradle` and explore it further to find out that the gradle enterprise does includes the 'test-retry' functionality as well. \r\n\r\n```\r\nplugins {\r\n    id 'com.gradle.enterprise' version '3.15.1'\r\n    id 'com.gradle.common-custom-user-data-gradle-plugin' version '1.12'\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI asked the same question at the Github and got this answer.\r\n\r\n> @iamsanjay , as you figured out, the Develocity/Gradle Enterprise plugin bundles the retry plugin. If you are using it, then I'd recommend to remove the explicit dependency on the retry plugin.

While we're looking for a new home for the default HTTP client and have agreed that UpdateShardHandler isn't the right place, the same applies to SolrClientCache. Extending SolrClientCache implies that we intend to use some of its functionality, but it operates quite differently. `SolrClientCache` creates clients based on URLs and checks if a client already exists whenever a class needs one; if not, it creates a new one—hence the suffix \"Cache.\" With the move to HTTP/2, we don't really need that functionality anymore. Therefore, I don't think extending SolrClientCache is a good idea. Additionally, the name doesn't suit the current HTTP/2 client since there's no cache—it's more of a provider, in my opinion.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2326571320/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2326587995","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2689#issuecomment-2326587995","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2689","id":2326587995,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6KrOpb","user":{"login":"iamsanjay","id":6595915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1OTU5MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6595915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamsanjay","html_url":"https://github.com/iamsanjay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamsanjay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamsanjay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamsanjay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamsanjay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamsanjay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamsanjay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamsanjay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamsanjay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamsanjay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-03T13:53:02Z","updated_at":"2024-09-03T13:53:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"An alternative would be to introduce another class and add a method in CoreContainer to return that class.
