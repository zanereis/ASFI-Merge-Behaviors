Thanks. From the test logs, ownership acquire seems not take to much time, but loadNamespaceTopics takes some time. \r\n\r\nThat is correct. `loadNamespaceTopics` will take some time even if the topics are already being loaded because it would fetch the list of topics (this would be then cached),  and go through the list to try to load them. \r\n\r\nIf we use the CompletableFuture, that should be solved anyway because we can complete the future and then load the topics in background. But the operation will be only triggered once.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/380185898/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/380200101","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/1011#issuecomment-380200101","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/1011","id":380200101,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MDIwMDEwMQ==","user":{"login":"lucperkins","id":1523104,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjMxMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1523104?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucperkins","html_url":"https://github.com/lucperkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucperkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucperkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucperkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucperkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucperkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucperkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucperkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucperkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucperkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-10T18:22:59Z","updated_at":"2018-04-10T18:22:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm going to close this for now and potentially re-open at a later date.
